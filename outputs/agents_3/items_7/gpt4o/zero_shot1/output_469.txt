Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36   6  56  61  48  24  56
1  15   4  78  43  29  81  72
2   2  80  96  95  20  33  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. 

Let's approach this allocation by maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuations: [36, 6, 56, 61, 48, 24, 56]
   - Highest values: Items 3 (61) and 6 (56)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuations: [15, 4, 78, 43, 29, 81, 72]
   - Highest values: Items 5 (81) and 2 (78)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations: [2, 80, 96, 95, 20, 33, 94]
   - Highest values: Items 2 (96) and 3 (95)

Let's allocate based on the highest valuation that each agent has, ensuring no item is doubly allocated:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 6 (56) can be allocated based on high value
  - Item 0 (36) can be allocated as it's also a unique high value for Agent 0

- Agent 1:
  - Item 5 (81) can be allocated based on high value
  - Item 1 (4) can be allocated as there's less competition for this item

- Agent 2:
  - Item 2 (96) is a preference, and since the highest value for this item is for Agent 2, allocate it.
  - Item 3 (95) is also highly valued by Agent 2.

To sum up, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all agents receive items according to their highest valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
