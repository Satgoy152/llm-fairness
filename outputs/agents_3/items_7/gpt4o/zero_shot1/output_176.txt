Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  69   9  80  16  93  90
1  66  31  57  14  73  95  34
2  39  71  10  66  18  84  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We'll start by evaluating the highest-valued items for each agent and try to distribute the items such that the total value received by each agent is relatively balanced.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [25, 69, 9, 80, 16, 93, 90]
- Agent 1: [66, 31, 57, 14, 73, 95, 34]
- Agent 2: [39, 71, 10, 66, 18, 84, 15]

To allocate items, we can look for each agent's top preferences:

- Agent 0 prefers item 5 (93) and item 3 (80).
- Agent 1 prefers item 5 (95) and item 4 (73).
- Agent 2 prefers item 5 (84) and item 1 (71).

Since item 5 is highly valued by all agents, we can give it to the agent with the highest valuation for it (Agent 1). Then we proceed to allocate other items based on their next highest preferences.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: items 3 (80) and 6 (90)
- Agent 1: items 5 (95) and 4 (73)
- Agent 2: items 1 (71), 0 (39), and 2 (10)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences and ensures all items are allocated.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [1, 0, 2]
}
```
