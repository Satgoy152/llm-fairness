Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  23  56  26  92  14  16
1  46  58  21  31  17  63  23
2  21  42  18  95  19  92   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46 58 21 31 17 63 23]
 [21 42 18 95 19 92  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a balanced number of items. Each agent should receive at least two items, and the distribution should try to maximize the satisfaction or value the agents derive from the items they receive.

Let's evaluate the allocations to maximize each agent's valuation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values are [51, 23, 56, 26, 92, 14, 16]
   - Highest values: 92 (Item 4), 56 (Item 2)

2. **Agent 1**: Values are [46, 58, 21, 31, 17, 63, 23]
   - Highest values: 63 (Item 5), 58 (Item 1)

3. **Agent 2**: Values are [21, 42, 18, 95, 19, 92, 3]
   - Highest values: 95 (Item 3), 92 (Item 5)

Let's assign the highest value items first and ensure each agent gets at least two items where possible.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items with highest values from Agent 0's perspective.
  - Item 4 (92), Item 2 (56)

- **Agent 1**: Assign items with highest values from Agent 1's perspective.
  - Item 5 (63), Item 1 (58)

- **Agent 2**: Assign items with highest values from Agent 2's perspective.
  - Item 3 (95), Item 6 (3)

We have allocated 6 items so far. We need to allocate the remaining 1 item.

- **Unallocated item**: Item 0
  - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 51, Agent 1 values it at 46, and Agent 2 values it at 21.
  - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 since they value it the most.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 2],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least two items, and the allocation is made in a way to maximize the total value perceived by each agent.
