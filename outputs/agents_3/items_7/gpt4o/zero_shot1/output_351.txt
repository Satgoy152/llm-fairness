Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  52  73  64  85   6   6
1  24  17  54   1  23   7  61
2  72  31  40  17  76  86  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 3 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives by considering their individual preferences. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: Values are [27, 52, 73, 64, 85, 6, 6]
   - Agent 1: Values are [24, 17, 54, 1, 23, 7, 61]
   - Agent 2: Values are [72, 31, 40, 17, 76, 86, 95]

2. **Sort Values to Determine Preferences**:
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (85), Item 2 (73), Item 3 (64), Item 1 (52), Item 0 (27), Item 5 (6), Item 6 (6)
   - Agent 1: Item 6 (61), Item 2 (54), Item 0 (24), Item 4 (23), Item 1 (17), Item 5 (7), Item 3 (1)
   - Agent 2: Item 6 (95), Item 5 (86), Item 4 (76), Item 0 (72), Item 2 (40), Item 1 (31), Item 3 (17)

3. **Allocate Based on Highest Value Preferences Without Conflicts**:
   - Start with items that have the highest value for any agent and assign them.
   - Ensure each agent receives some items, if possible, while maintaining the total number of items to 7.

4. **Perform Allocation**:
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (value 95)
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (value 86)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (value 85)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 73)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 64)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (value 72)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (value 17)

5. **Check and Ensure Fairness**:
   - Agent 0 gets items: [2, 3, 4]
   - Agent 1 gets items: [1]
   - Agent 2 gets items: [0, 5, 6]

6. **Final Allocation in JSON Format**:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 3 agents in a manner that maximizes individual agent's total valuation based on their preferences.
