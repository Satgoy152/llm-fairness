Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  20  69  71  65  60  68
1  12  82  98  92  18  60  76
2  38  54  89  99  96  41  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed. One approach is to use the "maximum sum of valuations" method where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Let's break down the allocation:

1. Look at each item and determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, by considering any ties or close values.

Here's the breakdown of allocations based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 values it at 12, and Agent 2 values it at 38. Agent 0 values it the most.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 values it at 82, and Agent 2 values it at 54. Agent 1 values it the most.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 values it at 98, and Agent 2 values it at 89. Agent 1 values it the most.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 values it at 92, and Agent 2 values it at 99. Agent 2 values it the most.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 values it at 18, and Agent 2 values it at 96. Agent 2 values it the most.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 values it at 60, and Agent 2 values it at 41. Agents 0 and 1 value it equally, but let's assign it to Agent 0 to ensure balanced distribution.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 values it at 76, and Agent 2 values it at 91. Agent 2 values it the most.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, all items have been distributed, and each agent has received a fair number of items based on their valuations. Note that ties or close valuations were resolved by trying to balance the number of items each agent receives.
