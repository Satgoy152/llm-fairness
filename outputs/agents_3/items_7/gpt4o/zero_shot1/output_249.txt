Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  17  81  74  33  89  90
1  67  76  53  37  98  61  19
2  88  24   8  39  45  63  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[56 17 81 74 33 89 90]
 [67 76 53 37 98 61 19]
 [88 24  8 39 45 63 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (since we have exactly 3 agents and 7 items, each agent should ideally receive 2 or 3 items).

Following a simple approach to maximize the total valuation:

1. Identify the highest valued item for each agent and allocate it to them.
2. Allocate the remaining items to maximize the overall valuation each agent receives.

Let's review the valuations:

Agent 0: [56, 17, 81, 74, 33, 89, 90]
Agent 1: [67, 76, 53, 37, 98, 61, 19]
Agent 2: [88, 24, 8, 39, 45, 63, 67]

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 6 (value 90) and 5 (value 89).
   - Allocate items 6 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (value 98) and 1 (value 76).
   - Allocate items 4 and 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 0 (value 88) and 5 (value 63), but item 5 is already taken by Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items**: 2 and 3
   - Agent 0 has items [6, 5], Agent 1 has items [4, 1], Agent 2 has item [0].
   - Agent 0's third highest item: 2 (value 81).
   - Agent 2's second highest item (remaining): 3 (value 39).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 and item 3 to Agent 2.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: [6, 5, 2]
- Agent 1: [4, 1]
- Agent 2: [0, 3]

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 2],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
