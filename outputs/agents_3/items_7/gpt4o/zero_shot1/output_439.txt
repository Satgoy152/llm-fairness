Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  16  15  42  88  81  93
1  64  37  67   4   7  42  51
2  91  72  59   3  33  54  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 72 59  3 33 54 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 50 + 16 + 15 + 42 + 88 + 81 + 93 = 385
   - Agent 1: 64 + 37 + 67 + 4 + 7 + 42 + 51 = 272
   - Agent 2: 91 + 72 + 59 + 3 + 33 + 54 + 40 = 352

2. Assign items such that the total value received by each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 5
- Agent 1 gets items: 2, 6
- Agent 2 gets items: 1, 3, 4

The total values for each agent after allocation are:
- Agent 0: 50 + 81 = 131
- Agent 1: 67 + 51 = 118
- Agent 2: 72 + 3 + 33 = 108

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
