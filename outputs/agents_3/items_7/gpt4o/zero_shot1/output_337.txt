Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  84  90  15  64  81  12
1  24  33  37  79  25   8   3
2  65  17  31  96  89  17  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step strategy to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - There are 3 agents and 7 items, so not all agents will receive the same number of items.
   - We need to ensure that the total number of items allocated across all agents is exactly 7.

2. **Valuation Matrix:**
   ```
       0   1   2   3   4   5   6
   0  35  84  90  15  64  81  12
   1  24  33  37  79  25   8   3
   2  65  17  31  96  89  17  16
   ```

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Prioritize assigning items to agents based on the highest value each agent places on an item.
   - Ensure that each agent gets at least one item.

4. **Step-by-Step Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (90), item 1 (84), and item 5 (81). Consider these for Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (79). Consider item 3 for Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (96) and item 4 (89). Consider these for Agent 2.
   - Aim to distribute items such that each agent gets a fair share and maximize their valuation.

5. **Proposed Allocation:**
   - Assign items in a manner that balances each agent's total valuation.

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [1, 2]
   - Agent 1: [3, 0]
   - Agent 2: [4, 5, 6]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items, maximizing the total values that agents receive based on their individual preferences, while ensuring all items are allocated.
