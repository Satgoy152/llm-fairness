Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  34  57  14  12   8  74
1  73  29  32  68  40   7  62
2  63  68  82  99  34  89  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation that each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. One approach is to use a variant of the "maximal marginal gain" strategy, where items are iteratively assigned to the agent who values them the most, considering the current allocation.

Let's go through the allocation step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total items each agent could potentially get based on their highest valuations.
2. Allocate items to maximize value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

We'll start with the highest valued items and work our way down:

Agent valuations:
- Agent 0: [23, 34, 57, 14, 12, 8, 74]
- Agent 1: [73, 29, 32, 68, 40, 7, 62]
- Agent 2: [63, 68, 82, 99, 34, 89, 11]

Items sorted by maximum value:
1. Item 3 (Agent 2 values it at 99)
2. Item 6 (Agent 0 values it at 74)
3. Item 5 (Agent 2 values it at 89)
4. Item 2 (Agent 2 values it at 82)
5. Item 0 (Agent 1 values it at 73)
6. Item 4 (Agent 1 values it at 40)
7. Item 1 (Agent 2 values it at 68)

Let's allocate:

- **Agent 2** gets item 3 (value 99), item 5 (value 89), and item 2 (value 82).
- **Agent 0** gets item 6 (value 74).
- **Agent 1** gets item 0 (value 73), item 4 (value 40).
- **Agent 2** gets item 1 (value 68) to balance out allocations.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 5, 2, 1]
}
```

However, we've over-allocated to Agent 2 in this scenario, leaving all items to them. To ensure fairness, let's adjust:

- Give Agent 1 item 1 instead of Agent 2.
- Give Agent 0 item 4 instead of Agent 1.

Adjusted allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Item 4 (value 12), item 6 (value 74)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (value 73), item 1 (value 29)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (value 82), item 3 (value 99), item 5 (value 89)

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
