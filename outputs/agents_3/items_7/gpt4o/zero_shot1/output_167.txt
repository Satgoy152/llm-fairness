Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20   4  40   4  38  20  89
1  75  22  54  24  38  16  15
2  77  97  35  32  51  40  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [75 22 54 24 38 16 15]
 [77 97 35 32 51 40 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the valuations provided by each agent for each item. A common approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value 77)
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value 97)
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 40)
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 24)
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 38)
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 40)
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value 89)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and the total value across agents is reasonably balanced. 

The final allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
