Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98   4  55  85  32  93  15
1  88  56  73  87  11  40  90
2  68  57  39  23  67  31  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [68 57 39 23 67 31 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a selection of items that maximizes their individual satisfaction while considering the overall distribution of items among agents.

Let's examine each agent's valuations:

- Agent 0: [98, 4, 55, 85, 32, 93, 15]
- Agent 1: [88, 56, 73, 87, 11, 40, 90]
- Agent 2: [68, 57, 39, 23, 67, 31, 89]

A possible approach is to try to allocate items such that the total valuation is maximized and each agent receives at least one item. This can be done by considering each agent's most valued item first and then proceeding to distribute the remaining items.

1. Allocate the highest valued item to each agent, if possible.
   - Agent 0's highest valued item is 0 (value 98).
   - Agent 1's highest valued item is 3 (value 87).
   - Agent 2's highest valued item is 6 (value 89).

2. Allocate remaining items based on the next highest valuations:
   - Agent 0: After item 0, the next high-value items are 5 (value 93), then 3 (value 85).
   - Agent 1: After item 3, the next high-value items are 6 (value 90), then 0 (value 88).
   - Agent 2: After item 6, the next high-value items are 4 (value 67), then 1 (value 57).

Given that each agent should receive at least one item and only 7 items should be allocated in total, we try to balance allocations while respecting individual top preferences.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 1
- Agent 2: Items 6, 2, 4

This allocation considers high-value preferences and evenly distributes the items.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [6, 2, 4]
}
```
