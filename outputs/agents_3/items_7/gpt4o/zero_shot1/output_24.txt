Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  41  29  96  21  81  96
1  54  23  82  34  86  62  32
2  26  12  43  24  15  44  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's assess the value each agent has for each item and attempt to allocate the items to maximize fairness and total valuation.

Here's the table of valuations for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 13     | 41     | 29     | 96     | 21     | 81     | 96     |
| 1     | 54     | 23     | 82     | 34     | 86     | 62     | 32     |
| 2     | 26     | 12     | 43     | 24     | 15     | 44     | 46     |

Given this setup, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 highly values Items 3 and 6.
- Agent 1 highly values Items 0 and 4.
- Agent 2 has relatively lower valuations across the items, but we can assign based on remaining items and maximizing their total valuation.

Proposed allocation:

- Assign Item 3 and Item 6 to Agent 0 (valuations: 96, 96).
- Assign Item 0 and Item 4 to Agent 1 (valuations: 54, 86).
- Assign Item 2, Item 5, and Item 1 to Agent 2 (valuations: 43, 44, 12).

This allocation strives to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are assigned, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
