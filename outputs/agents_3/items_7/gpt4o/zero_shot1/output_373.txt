Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22   9  22   0  93  62  96
1  47  49  58  96  91  78   8
2  55  53  32  89  10  88  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's look at the valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We start by considering the highest value items for each agent and proceed from there.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are item 6 (96) and item 4 (93).
   - Let's allocate item 6 and item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item for Agent 1 is item 3 (96).
   - Next is item 2 (58).
   - Allocate item 3 and item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item for Agent 2 is item 5 (88).
   - Next is item 3, but it's already allocated, so we skip to item 1 (53).
   - Allocate item 5 and item 1 to Agent 2.

Finally, we have one item left: item 0. We can allocate it to Agent 2 since they have the next highest value for it (55 vs. 22 for Agent 0 and 47 for Agent 1).

Let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```

This way, each agent has an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.
