Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  73  59  12  49  62  72
1  44  67  23  12  68  87  66
2  48  97  58  22  70   1  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to assign items to agents such that the total valuations are reasonably balanced. Let's consider the valuations provided and attempt to distribute the items accordingly.

Below is a suggested allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, and 5
   - Total valuation: 72 (item 0) + 73 (item 1) + 62 (item 5) = 207

2. **Agent 1**: Items 4 and 6
   - Total valuation: 68 (item 4) + 66 (item 6) = 134

3. **Agent 2**: Items 2 and 3
   - Total valuation: 58 (item 2) + 22 (item 3) = 80

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations, though perfect balance may not be possible due to the discrete nature of the items and their varying valuations. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
