Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  97  33  56  39  89  87
1  80  79  81  20  57  84  71
2  37  69  57   8  83  51  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a heuristic approach to distribute the items in a way that seems equitable based on the given values. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most.

Now, let's consider the allocations:

- Agent 0: Initially gets items [1, 3, 5, 6].
- Agent 1: Initially gets items [0, 2].
- Agent 2: Initially gets item [4].

Checking the allocations:

- Agent 0 has four items.
- Agent 1 has two items.
- Agent 2 has one item.

This allocation respects the condition of assigning all 7 items. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while attempting to maximize the satisfaction based on the given valuations.
