Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  76  69  47  53   4  15
1  76  14  25  49  63   3  88
2  12   1  52  85  33  82  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We can approach this by considering each agent's highest valued items and distribute them accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 0's highest valued items:
   - Item 1: 76
   - Item 2: 69
   - Item 0: 49

2. Agent 1's highest valued items:
   - Item 0: 76
   - Item 6: 88
   - Item 4: 63

3. Agent 2's highest valued items:
   - Item 3: 85
   - Item 5: 82
   - Item 2: 52

Attempt to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Item 0).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for Item 1).
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Item 2).
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for Item 3).
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Item 4).
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value for Item 5).
- Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value for Item 6).

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share based on their valuations. Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
