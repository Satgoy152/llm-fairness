Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  57  82  98  40  34  25
1  41  74   3  65  39  66   2
2   0  11  76  93  38  97  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 11 76 93 38 97 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 3 and 2.
   - Allocate item 3 (98) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 1 and 5.
   - Allocate item 1 (74) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 5 and 3.
   - Allocate item 5 (97) to Agent 2.

Now, we repeat the process for remaining items:

4. **Agent 0**: Consider items 0 and 2.
   - Allocate item 2 (82) to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1**: Consider items 0 and 4.
   - Allocate item 4 (39) to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 2**: Consider items 6 and 0.
   - Allocate item 6 (66) to Agent 2.

Finally, allocate the last item:

7. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 0 (36) to Agent 0.

The final allocations would then be:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```
