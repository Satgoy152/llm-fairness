Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  68  55  72  65  34  88
1  70  61  25  24  32   7  41
2  57  51  99  63  71  49  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. This can be approached by considering each agent's preferences and distributing the items to maximize satisfaction.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest preference for item 6 with a value of 88.
   - Next preference for item 0 with a value of 73.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest preference for item 0 with a value of 70 (already taken by agent 0).
   - Next preference for item 1 with a value of 61.
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest preference for item 2 with a value of 99.
   - Next preference for item 6 with a value of 98 (already taken by agent 0).
   - Next preference for item 4 with a value of 71.

### Allocation:

Let's ensure that all items are distributed and each agent gets their fair share:

- Agent 0: [6, 0]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2, 4]

Remaining items are 3 and 5. Allocate them to the agents who can derive some value:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it at 72.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as they value it at 49.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their preferences.
