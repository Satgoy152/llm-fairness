Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  34  56  49  69  74  68
1  13  96  59  97  66  57   5
2  41  48  52  46  92  21   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (if possible), and every item is allocated.

Let's start by looking for the highest valuations each agent has for the items and distribute based on that:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (74), Item 4 (69)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (97), Item 1 (96)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (92), Item 0 (41)

Let's attempt an allocation:

- Assign Item 5 (74) to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 3 (97) to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 4 (92) to Agent 2.

Since Item 4 is already allocated to Agent 2, let's re-evaluate:

- Assign Item 1 (96) to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 0 (41) to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 (52) to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 6 (5) to Agent 1.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share while maximizing their individual valuations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 5]

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 6],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
