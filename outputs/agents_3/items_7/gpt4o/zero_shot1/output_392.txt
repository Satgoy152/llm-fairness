Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  39  57   4  86  19  44
1  80   1  81  38  51  35  51
2  53  49   2  90  62  84  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent by assigning items in a way that each agent gets the items they value the most. We will aim to allocate all 7 items such that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the values and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (86), Item 2 (57), Item 6 (44)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (80), Item 2 (81), Item 4 (51), Item 6 (51)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (90), Item 6 (90), Item 5 (84), Item 4 (62)

To allocate fairly and ensure all items are assigned:

- **Assign Item 4 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for this item (86).
- **Assign Item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item highly (81).
- **Assign Item 3 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for this item (90).
- **Assign Item 6 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest remaining valuation for this item (90).
- **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the next highest valuation for this item (80).
- **Assign Item 5 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values this item highly (84).
- **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 has a reasonable valuation for this item (39).

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [3, 6, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives a fair distribution based on their preferences.
