Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  81  94  97  16  57  94
1  41  61  29  21  49  29  95
2  81  68  42  65   9  84  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to look for a way to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's consider the values each agent has for each item and attempt to distribute the items accordingly:

| Agent | Item | Valuation |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 0     | 0    | 22        |
| 0     | 1    | 81        |
| 0     | 2    | 94        |
| 0     | 3    | 97        |
| 0     | 4    | 16        |
| 0     | 5    | 57        |
| 0     | 6    | 94        |
| 1     | 0    | 41        |
| 1     | 1    | 61        |
| 1     | 2    | 29        |
| 1     | 3    | 21        |
| 1     | 4    | 49        |
| 1     | 5    | 29        |
| 1     | 6    | 95        |
| 2     | 0    | 81        |
| 2     | 1    | 68        |
| 2     | 2    | 42        |
| 2     | 3    | 65        |
| 2     | 4    | 9         |
| 2     | 5    | 84        |
| 2     | 6    | 60        |

Based on these valuations, a potential fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 3 to agent 0 (highest valuation for item 3)
- Assign item 6 to agent 1 (highest valuation for item 6)
- Assign items 0 and 5 to agent 2 (high valuations compared to others)
- Assign items 1 and 2 to agent 0 (high valuations compared to others)
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (moderate valuation, balancing the allocation)

This allocation attempts to maximize the value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This assignment ensures that all 7 items are allocated among the 3 agents, aiming for a balanced distribution based on their valuations.
