Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  66  59  99  59  15  80
1  52  91  29   5  93  64  43
2  78  51  97  74  88  53  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the allocations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 6.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 and 0.

We will distribute the items to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 3 (value 99)
   - Item 6 (value 80)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 1 (value 91)
   - Item 4 (value 93)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 0 (value 78)
   - Item 2 (value 97)
   - Item 5 (value 53)

This distribution ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and each agent gets at least one item, respecting their highest valuations as much as possible.
