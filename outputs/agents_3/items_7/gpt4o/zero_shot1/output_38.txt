Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  17  11  25  66  59  66
1  37  89  57  31  47  69  64
2  68  28  41  45  67  95  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[72 17 11 25 66 59 66]
 [37 89 57 31 47 69 64]
 [68 28 41 45 67 95 67]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Let's try to allocate items in a way that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences while ensuring that every item is assigned.

First, let's evaluate the preferences of each agent to maximize their satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** [72, 17, 11, 25, 66, 59, 66]
2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** [37, 89, 57, 31, 47, 69, 64]
3. **Agent 2's Valuations:** [68, 28, 41, 45, 67, 95, 67]

Next, let's allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction, trying to give each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring everyone receives at least one item:

- **Step 1:** Assign the highest valued items to each agent:
  - Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 72).
  - Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 89).
  - Agent 2 gets item 5 (value 95).

- **Step 2:** Assign remaining items to balance the allocation:
  - Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 66), the next highest value.
  - Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 57), the next highest value.
  - Agent 2 gets item 4 (value 67), the next highest value.

- **Step 3:** Distribute the last remaining item to ensure all items are allocated:
  - Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 31).

This allocation ensures each agent has items, and overall valuations are maximized fairly.

Here are the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the requirement that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.
