Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  38  61  37  74  60  64
1  34  65  26  14  84  75  31
2  78  29  50  98  85  25  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[47 38 61 37 74 60 64]
 [34 65 26 14 84 75 31]
 [78 29 50 98 85 25 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation and try to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of items.

We have the valuations as follows:

```
Agent 0: [47, 38, 61, 37, 74, 60, 64]
Agent 1: [34, 65, 26, 14, 84, 75, 31]
Agent 2: [78, 29, 50, 98, 85, 25, 62]
```

First, let's rank the items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest (78).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest (65).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest (61).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest (98).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest (84).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the highest (75).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the highest (64).

Now, we will attempt to allocate items fairly:

1. Allocate item 3 to agent 2 (highest value: 98).
2. Allocate item 4 to agent 1 (highest value: 84).
3. Allocate item 5 to agent 1 (second highest value: 75).
4. Allocate item 0 to agent 2 (second highest value: 78).
5. Allocate item 6 to agent 0 (highest value: 64).
6. Allocate item 1 to agent 1 (highest value: 65).
7. Allocate item 2 to agent 0 (highest value: 61).

Each agent now receives:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items while maximizing the overall valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
