Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  87  59  86  18  32  84
1  80  22  41   4  88  16  53
2  21  39  74  46  14  27  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[60 87 59 86 18 32 84]
 [80 22 41  4 88 16 53]
 [21 39 74 46 14 27 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. A simple way to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Let's proceed with this method:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 60.
   - Agent 1 values it at 80.
   - Agent 2 values it at 21.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 87.
   - Agent 1 values it at 22.
   - Agent 2 values it at 39.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 59.
   - Agent 1 values it at 41.
   - Agent 2 values it at 74.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 86.
   - Agent 1 values it at 4.
   - Agent 2 values it at 46.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 18.
   - Agent 1 values it at 88.
   - Agent 2 values it at 14.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 32.
   - Agent 1 values it at 16.
   - Agent 2 values it at 27.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 84.
   - Agent 1 values it at 53.
   - Agent 2 values it at 20.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0.

The allocations, considering each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are assigned, are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
