Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  64  96   1  42  62  66
1  22  34  49  58  32  71  88
2   1  39  38  45  44  93  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We need to distribute all 7 items between the 3 agents.

Let's start by examining the highest valuation each agent has for each item:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 (95), 2 (96).
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 6 (88).
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5 (93).

We can allocate items based on maximizing these individual preferences while distributing items fairly:

1. Allocate items with the highest values per agent to those agents.
2. Distribute the remaining items to balance the number of items per agent.

Let's allocate items:

- Agent 0:
  - Items 0 and 2 (high values)
  
- Agent 1:
  - Item 6 (high value)
  
- Agent 2:
  - Item 5 (high value)

Now we have allocated the items with the highest individual valuations. Let's allocate the remaining items (1, 3, 4):

- Item 1: Agent 0 (value 64, highest among unallocated items)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (value 58, next highest)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (value 44, next highest)

This distribution gives each agent some high-value items based on their individual preferences and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 1],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [5, 4]
}
```
