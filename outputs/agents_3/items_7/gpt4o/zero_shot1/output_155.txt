Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  17  75  72  72  63  20
1  33  33  12  62  39  92  70
2  59  85   7  85  46  88  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's analyze the values each agent has for the items, and try to distribute them in a way that balances these values across the agents.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest values as long as it doesn't lead to an unfair distribution of items. 

2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, but prioritize maximizing the total value an agent receives.

Let's go through the items:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 5 and 6.
- Agent 2 has high values for items 1 and 6.

By examining these preferences and aiming for fairness, we can propose the following allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value: 75).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value: 72).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value: 72).
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value: 92).
5. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value: 93).
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value: 85).
7. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value: 33).

This allocation aims to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences while ensuring fairness.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.
