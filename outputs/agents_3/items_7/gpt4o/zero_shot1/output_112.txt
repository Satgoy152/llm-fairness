Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  45  71  44  73  15  53
1  30   5  88  25  52  73  12
2   9   1  26   2  11  39  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 3 45 71 44 73 15 53]
 [30  5 88 25 52 73 12]
 [ 9  1 26  2 11 39 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's utility while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Below is one way to allocate based on the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations: [3, 45, 71, 44, 73, 15, 53]
Agent 1's valuations: [30, 5, 88, 25, 52, 73, 12]
Agent 2's valuations: [9, 1, 26, 2, 11, 39, 38]

Let's allocate items to agents by considering their highest valuation first:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the most with a valuation of 73.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most with a valuation of 88.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the most with a valuation of 39.

After these initial allocations, we have allocated items 2, 4, and 5. Next, we consider the remaining items (0, 1, 3, 6):

4. Agent 0's next highest valuation is for item 2, which is already allocated, so we move to item 6 with a valuation of 53.
5. Agent 1â€™s next highest valuation is for item 5, already allocated, so we move to item 4, already allocated, and then to item 0 with a valuation of 30.
6. Agent 2's next highest valuation is for item 6, already allocated, so we move to item 3 with a valuation of 2.

Finally, we have:

Agent 0: items 4 and 6
Agent 1: items 2 and 0
Agent 2: items 5 and 3

Item 1 remains unallocated, so we should allocate it to the agent with the least total value. Agent 1 currently has items with valuations 88 and 30, totaling 118. Agent 0 has valuations 73 and 53, totaling 126. Agent 2 has valuations 39 and 2, totaling 41. Therefore, we allocate item 1 to Agent 2 to balance the overall valuation.

The final allocation is:

Agent 0: items 4, 6
Agent 1: items 2, 0
Agent 2: items 5, 3, 1

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [5, 3, 1]
}
```
