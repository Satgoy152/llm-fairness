Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  79  23  95  96  97  21
1  84  43   9  51  95   9   7
2  71  16   3  84  99  29  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed. We will consider each agent's preferences and try to give each agent the items they value the most.

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** [63, 79, 23, 95, 96, 97, 21]
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (97), Item 4 (96), Item 3 (95)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** [84, 43, 9, 51, 95, 9, 7]
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (84), Item 4 (95), Item 3 (51)

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:** [71, 16, 3, 84, 99, 29, 27]
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (99), Item 3 (84), Item 0 (71)

To allocate the items, let's start with the highest valued items and assign them to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets a fair number.

- **Item 4** is highly valued by Agent 2 (99), so assign it to Agent 2.
- **Item 5** is highly valued by Agent 0 (97), so assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 3** is next highly valued by Agent 0 (95), but since Agent 2 also highly values it (84), and they already got Item 4, assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 0** is highly valued by Agent 1 (84), so assign it to Agent 1.
- **Item 1** is next highly valued by Agent 0 (79), so assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 2** is the least valued by all but assign it to Agent 0 as they have fewer items of high value.
- **Item 6** is next, assign it to Agent 2 to balance the distribution.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives the items they value highly and all items are allocated.
