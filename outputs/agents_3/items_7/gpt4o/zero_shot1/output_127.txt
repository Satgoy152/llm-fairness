Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  93  85  95  42  73  55
1  38   4  97  63  38  81  15
2  54  37   6  74  46  94  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[39 93 85 95 42 73 55]
 [38  4 97 63 38 81 15]
 [54 37  6 74 46 94 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation of the items. We can use a simple greedy approach to assign items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 54.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 93.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 95.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 46.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 94.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 79.

Now let's allocate the items to the agents:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 2.
7. Assign Item 6 to Agent 2.

After this allocation, the distribution is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 4, 5, 6]

Finally, here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
