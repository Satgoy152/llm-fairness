Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  16  76  44  74  34  11
1   5  53  45   6  13  16  92
2  62  60  84  34   2   5  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[87 16 76 44 74 34 11]
 [ 5 53 45  6 13 16 92]
 [62 60 84 34  2  5 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here is one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 87.
   - Next, agent 0 values item 2 at 76.
   - Assign items 0 and 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the highest at 92.
   - Next, agent 1 values item 1 at 53.
   - Assign items 6 and 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest, but item 2 is already assigned to agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 highly as well, but it's assigned to agent 0.
   - The next highest for agent 2 is item 3 at 34.
   - Assign items 3, 4, and 5 to agent 2.

Now let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, while distributing all 7 items.
