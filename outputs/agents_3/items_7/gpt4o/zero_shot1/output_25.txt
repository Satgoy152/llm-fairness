Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  87  26  11  59  94  32
1  58  88  79  34  37  54  16
2  16  51  89  20  15  73  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction or value each agent receives from their allocated items. One approach is to allocate the items based on each agent's highest valuations, ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (94), Item 1 (87)
   - Allocation: Item 5, Item 1

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (88), Item 2 (79)
   - Allocation: Item 2, Item 4

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 6 (98), Item 2 (89)
   - Allocation: Item 6, Item 3, Item 0

After evaluating the valuations, here is a possible fair allocation of items:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while attempting to maximize the value each agent receives.
