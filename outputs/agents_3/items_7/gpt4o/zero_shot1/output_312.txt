Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97   9  62  38  84  24  76
1  75  98  17  52   9  93  81
2  57  41  57  42  51  65  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97  9 62 38 84 24 76]
 [75 98 17 52  9 93 81]
 [57 41 57 42 51 65 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that iteratively assigns each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 97
   - Agent 1 values it at 75
   - Agent 2 values it at 57
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value).

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 9
   - Agent 1 values it at 98
   - Agent 2 values it at 41
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value).

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 62
   - Agent 1 values it at 17
   - Agent 2 values it at 57
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value).

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 38
   - Agent 1 values it at 52
   - Agent 2 values it at 42
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value).

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 84
   - Agent 1 values it at 9
   - Agent 2 values it at 51
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value).

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 24
   - Agent 1 values it at 93
   - Agent 2 values it at 65
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value).

7. **Item 6:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 76
   - Agent 1 values it at 81
   - Agent 2 values it at 48
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value).

Now, let's convert this allocation into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives based on their preferences, with Agent 0 receiving items 0, 2, and 4, Agent 1 receiving items 1, 3, 5, and 6, and Agent 2 receiving no items.
