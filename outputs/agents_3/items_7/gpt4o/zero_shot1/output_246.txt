Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  12  98  45  74  20  74
1  56  83  86  64  98  98  79
2  47  55  49  93   0   7  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible or no more than an equal distribution of items. We can approach this by examining each agent's valuations for the items and trying to allocate high-value items to each agent.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [3, 12, 98, 45, 74, 20, 74]
- Agent 1: [56, 83, 86, 64, 98, 98, 79]
- Agent 2: [47, 55, 49, 93, 0, 7, 36]

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Allocate the highest value item for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 can get item 2 (value 98).
   - Agent 1 can get item 4 (value 98).
   - Agent 2 can get item 3 (value 93).

2. **Allocate remaining items considering the next highest valuations:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 5, 6.

   - Agent 0 next highest values are: item 4 (74), item 6 (74).
   - Agent 1 next highest values are: item 5 (98), item 1 (83).
   - Agent 2 next highest values are: item 1 (55), item 0 (47).
   
   Given the constraints, we can try the following distribution for remaining items:
   
   - Item 5 to Agent 1 (value 98, highest remaining for Agent 1).
   - Item 6 to Agent 0 (value 74, highest remaining for Agent 0).
   - Item 1 to Agent 2 (value 55, highest remaining for Agent 2).
   - Item 0 to Agent 1 (value 56, next highest for Agent 1).

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 5, 0]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 1]

Here's how the allocation looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4, 5, 0],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```
