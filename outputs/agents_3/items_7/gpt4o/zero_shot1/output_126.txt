Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  22  40  92  63  30  46
1  98  22  54  74  53  97  48
2  14  11  53  53  12  42  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [14 11 53 53 12 42 89]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations in the table, we need to distribute the 7 items among the 3 agents.

We can use a greedy approach to allocate the items:

1. Start by identifying the highest value for each item across all agents.
2. Assign the item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 98 by Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 22 by Agent 0 (tie with Agent 1, but Agent 0 hasn't been assigned any items yet).
3. Item 2: Highest value is 54 by Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 92 by Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 63 by Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 97 by Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Highest value is 89 by Agent 2.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets fairly allocated items. Since Agent 0 and Agent 1 have more items, we'll adjust so Agent 2 gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 5
- Agent 2: Item 6

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [6]
}
```
