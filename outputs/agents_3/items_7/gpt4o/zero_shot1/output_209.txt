Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  37  49  42  55  97  50
1  55  41  68   0  27  91  47
2  36  19  30  15  95  28  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. One common approach for such allocations is using the "maximum weighted matching" in a bipartite graph, but for simplicity, let's try a heuristic approach that works for small-scale problems like this.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 is assigned items 0, 5, and 6.
- Agent 1 is assigned items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 is assigned items 1 and 3.

This allocation distributes the items such that each agent receives items, and the total valuations are reasonably distributed. Let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 3 agents.
