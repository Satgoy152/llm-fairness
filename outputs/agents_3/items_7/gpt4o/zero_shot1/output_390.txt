Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  78  86   3  85  67   9
1   1  70  53  40   1  37  36
2  10  76  74   6  62  23  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 76 74  6 62 23 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the valuations for each agent and each item:**

   - Agent 0: [66, 78, 86, 3, 85, 67, 9]
   - Agent 1: [1, 70, 53, 40, 1, 37, 36]
   - Agent 2: [10, 76, 74, 6, 62, 23, 35]

2. **Sort the items by the highest valuations regardless of the agent:**

   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 86
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 85
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 78
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 66
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 67
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 36
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 40

3. **Allocate items based on the highest valuations:**

   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation of 86)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation of 85)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation of 78)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation of 66)
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation of 67)
   - This covers all the highest valuations. Now allocate remaining items with consideration for other agents.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (highest remaining valuation by Agent 1)
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (highest remaining valuation by Agent 2)

4. **Verify that all items are allocated, and each agent gets a fair share:**

   - Agent 0 has 5 items: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]
   - Agent 1 has 1 item: [3]
   - Agent 2 has 1 item: [6]

The allocation is fair in terms of maximizing valuations for each agent given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6]
}
```
