Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  30  92   4  73  65  65
1  77  39   7  26  91  96  10
2  96  20  54  21  38  88  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[28 30 92  4 73 65 65]
 [77 39  7 26 91 96 10]
 [96 20 54 21 38 88 16]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible and all items are allocated.

First, let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [28, 30, 92, 4, 73, 65, 65]
- Agent 1: [77, 39, 7, 26, 91, 96, 10]
- Agent 2: [96, 20, 54, 21, 38, 88, 16]

Next, we'll allocate items by considering the highest valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it highest at 96.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 39, higher than Agent 2's 20 and Agent 0's 30.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it highest at 92.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it highest at 26.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it highest at 91.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it highest at 96.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 and Agent 2 both have the same valuation of 65, but we'll give it to Agent 2 to balance out the number of items.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [2] (Total valuation: 92)
- Agent 1: [1, 3, 4, 5] (Total valuation: 39 + 26 + 91 + 96 = 252)
- Agent 2: [0, 6] (Total valuation: 96 + 65 = 161)

Each agent has received at least one item, and all items have been allocated. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 6]
}
```
