Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  14  30  30  91  51  19
1  68  76  42  36  24   1  11
2   4  97  13  97  83  86  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98 14 30 30 91 51 19]
 [68 76 42 36 24  1 11]
 [ 4 97 13 97 83 86 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 3 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, based on their individual valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

To achieve this, let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Highest value items: 0 (98), 4 (91), 5 (51)

- Agent 1:
  - Highest value items: 1 (76), 2 (42), 3 (36)

- Agent 2:
  - Highest value items: 1 (97), 3 (97), 5 (86)

Next, let's distribute the items by considering the highest values for each agent while ensuring a fair allocation.

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 98).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 97) since it's the highest value among all agents for this item.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 42) as it's a significant value for them.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 97) as it's the highest for them.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 91).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 86).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 11) to ensure each agent receives at least two items.

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.
