Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  32  38  78  35  13   1
1  95  62  13  67  51  58  44
2  94  33  30  29  10  19  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 2 32 38 78 35 13  1]
 [95 62 13 67 51 58 44]
 [94 33 30 29 10 19 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 3 very highly (78), so allocate item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (95) and item 1 (62), so allocate items 0 and 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 6 (57) the most, so allocate item 6 to agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 4 out of 7 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (38) and item 4 (35) to agent 0, as these have relatively higher valuations for agent 0 compared to other agents.

- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 5 (58) to agent 1, which is the only item left and has a reasonable valuation for agent 1.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and tries to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [6]
}
```
