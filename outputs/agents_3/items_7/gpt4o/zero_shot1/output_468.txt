Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1   8  94  43  62  96  83
1  15  10  33  40  70  13   9
2  54  26  30  34   2  43  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54 26 30 34  2 43 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim to maximize the total value for each agent. We can use a simple greedy approach, where we allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here is the breakdown of how each item should be allocated based on the highest valuation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 1
   - Agent 1 values it at 15
   - Agent 2 values it at 54
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 54)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 8
   - Agent 1 values it at 10
   - Agent 2 values it at 26
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 26)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 94
   - Agent 1 values it at 33
   - Agent 2 values it at 30
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 94)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 43
   - Agent 1 values it at 40
   - Agent 2 values it at 34
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 43)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 62
   - Agent 1 values it at 70
   - Agent 2 values it at 2
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value: 70)

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 96
   - Agent 1 values it at 13
   - Agent 2 values it at 43
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 96)

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 83
   - Agent 1 values it at 9
   - Agent 2 values it at 20
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 83)

After allocation, the distribution of items is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.
