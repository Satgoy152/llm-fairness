Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51   2  98  55   3  38  50
1  48  62  60  18   7  32  61
2  55  91  39  27  44  29  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[51  2 98 55  3 38 50]
 [48 62 60 18  7 32 61]
 [55 91 39 27 44 29 49]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 and 3, with values 98 and 55 respectively.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 and 6, with values 62 and 61 respectively.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 1, 0, and 4, with values 91, 55, and 44 respectively.

Based on maximizing each agent's total value:

- **Agent 0** can be allocated items 2 and 3. The total value for Agent 0 is 98 + 55 = 153.
- **Agent 1** can be allocated items 1 and 6. The total value for Agent 1 is 62 + 61 = 123.
- **Agent 2** can be allocated items 0, 4, and 5. The total value for Agent 2 is 55 + 44 + 29 = 128.

This way, each agent receives a fair portion of items based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
