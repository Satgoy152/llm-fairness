Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  39  79  56   5  14  41
1  78  74  79  79  70  25  37
2  10  40  76  93  90  80  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 39 79 56  5 14 41]
 [78 74 79 79 70 25 37]
 [10 40 76 93 90 80 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Let's analyze the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 91
  - Item 1: 39
  - Item 2: 79
  - Item 3: 56
  - Item 4: 5
  - Item 5: 14
  - Item 6: 41

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 79
  - Item 3: 79
  - Item 4: 70
  - Item 5: 25
  - Item 6: 37

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 1: 40
  - Item 2: 76
  - Item 3: 93
  - Item 4: 90
  - Item 5: 80
  - Item 6: 28

A possible allocation strategy is to assign the highest valued items for each agent, ensuring that all items are distributed:

1. Assign Agent 0 their highest valued item: Item 0
2. Assign Agent 1 their highest valued item: Item 2
3. Assign Agent 2 their highest valued item: Item 3
4. Assign Agent 2 their next highest valued item: Item 4
5. Assign Agent 0 their next highest valued item: Item 1
6. Assign Agent 2 their next highest valued item: Item 5
7. Assign Agent 1 their next highest valued item: Item 6

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their preference, and all 7 items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
