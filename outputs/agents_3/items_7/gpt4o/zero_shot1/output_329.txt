Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  34   4  35  60  73  31
1  16  71  94  94  70  51  42
2  61  73  61  33  62  44   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that considers maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed. 

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets a fair distribution of items.

Let's evaluate each item:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (61).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (71).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (94).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (94).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (60).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (73).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (31).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3
- Agent 2: Item 0

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed. Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
