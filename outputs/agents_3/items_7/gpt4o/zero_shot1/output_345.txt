Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  61  59  13  23  18  56
1  97  32  58  91  21  32  69
2  62   1  21  39  18  56  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 61 59 13 23 18 56]
 [97 32 58 91 21 32 69]
 [62  1 21 39 18 56 91]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items. This problem is similar to the "assignment problem" in combinatorial optimization, where we want to assign items to agents in a way that maximizes the total valuation.

We'll use the valuation table provided to make allocations:

```
Valuation Table:
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  61  59  13  23  18  56
1  97  32  58  91  21  32  69
2  62   1  21  39  18  56  91
```

Let's assign items such that each agent gets items that have relatively high valuations for them while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

1. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (97) and item 3 (91), so let's assign these items to Agent 1.
2. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 6 (91), so item 6 is assigned to Agent 2.
3. Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 1 and 2, so assigning these to Agent 0 makes sense.
4. Agent 2 can take item 5, as it has a decent valuation (56) for it.
5. Finally, Agent 0 can take item 4, as it has a reasonable valuation (23) compared to the other options.

Now, each agent has received some items, and all items have been allocated. Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
