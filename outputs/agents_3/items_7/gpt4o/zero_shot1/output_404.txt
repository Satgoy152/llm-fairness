Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  30  61  74  92  36  18
1  70  64  38  20  82  61  43
2  82  59  47  43  23  45   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 30 61 74 92 36 18]
 [70 64 38 20 82 61 43]
 [82 59 47 43 23 45  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 4 (92) and 3 (74).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 0 (70) and 4 (82).
   - Since item 4 is already taken, assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 0 (82) and 1 (59), but item 0 is already taken.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

After these initial allocations, each agent has received at least one item. We continue allocating the remaining items:

4. **Remaining items**: 2, 3, 5, 6.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (valuation 43, highest among remaining).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (valuation 61, highest among remaining).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (valuation 61, highest among remaining for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (valuation 43, highest among remaining for Agent 1).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7.
