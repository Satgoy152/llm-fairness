Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41   3  57  42  38   5  17
1  67  67  34  31  31  97  99
2  92  58  47  62  63  19  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Create a list of items, each paired with their valuations from all agents.
2. For each item, assign it to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's go through this process with the given valuations:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 | Agent 2 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 41      | 67      | 92      |
| 1    | 3       | 67      | 58      |
| 2    | 57      | 34      | 47      |
| 3    | 42      | 31      | 62      |
| 4    | 38      | 31      | 63      |
| 5    | 5       | 97      | 19      |
| 6    | 17      | 99      | 34      |

Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (92)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (67)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (57)
- Item 3: Agent 2 (62)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (63)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (97)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (99)

Now, ensure each agent gets items, and the allocation is fair:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5, 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3, 4

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total valuation for each agent. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
