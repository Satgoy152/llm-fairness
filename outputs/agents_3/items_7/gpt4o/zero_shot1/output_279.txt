Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  29  54  12  32  10  53
1  65  98  11  70  23  82  57
2  37  19  84  34  94  54  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 29 54 12 32 10 53]
 [65 98 11 70 23 82 57]
 [37 19 84 34 94 54 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that every item is allocated. Here's one way to approach this allocation problem:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation items: [0 (93), 2 (54)]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation items: [1 (98), 5 (82)]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation items: [4 (94), 6 (82), 3 (34)]

Now, let's try allocating the items based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent:

- **Agent 0:** Allocating items 0 and 2 to Agent 0 because they have the highest valuation for these items.
- **Agent 1:** Allocating items 1 and 5 to Agent 1 because they have the highest valuation for these items.
- **Agent 2:** Allocating items 4 and 6 to Agent 2 because they have the highest valuation for these items.
- We still need to allocate item 3. Since Agent 1 has a higher valuation (70) for item 3 than Agent 0 (12) and Agent 2 (34), we assign it to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it most highly, as far as possible, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
