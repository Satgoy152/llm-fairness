Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  84  61  78   1  36  96
1  54  31  38  25  62  71   8
2  71  14  76  75  30  20   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54 31 38 25 62 71  8]
 [71 14 76 75 30 20  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. We will assign items to agents in a way that balances the allocation fairly, considering their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (96), Item 1 (84), Item 3 (78)
   - Allocate: Item 6, Item 1

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (71), Item 4 (62), Item 0 (54)
   - Allocate: Item 5, Item 4, Item 0

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (76), Item 3 (75), Item 0 (71)
   - Allocate: Item 2, Item 3

Following this allocation, we have distributed all 7 items:

- **Agent 0** receives items 6 and 1.
- **Agent 1** receives items 5, 4, and 0.
- **Agent 2** receives items 2 and 3.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [5, 4, 0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
