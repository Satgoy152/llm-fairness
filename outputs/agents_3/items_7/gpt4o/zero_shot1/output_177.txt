Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  19  54  46  87  34  69
1  43  35  22  30  36  73  32
2  94  91  94  80  83  94  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. This can be approached by using a method like the "Greedy Allocation" approach, which assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives approximately equal numbers of items.

Let's evaluate the items one by one:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 43
   - Agent 2 values it at 94
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 94)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 19
   - Agent 1 values it at 35
   - Agent 2 values it at 91
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 91)

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 54
   - Agent 1 values it at 22
   - Agent 2 values it at 94
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 94)

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 46
   - Agent 1 values it at 30
   - Agent 2 values it at 80
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 80)

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 87
   - Agent 1 values it at 36
   - Agent 2 values it at 83
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 87)

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 34
   - Agent 1 values it at 73
   - Agent 2 values it at 94
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 94)

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 69
   - Agent 1 values it at 32
   - Agent 2 values it at 77
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 77)

After the initial allocation, Agent 2 receives all the items due to their high valuations. This leaves Agent 0 and Agent 1 with no items, which is not a fair allocation. To make it fair, we reassign some items:

Reallocate items to balance the number of items each agent receives:

- Reassign **Item 4** to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 has high valuation and this maintains balance).
- Reassign **Item 5** to Agent 1 (as Agent 1 has high valuation for it, and it helps balance the allocation).

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [4]
- **Agent 1**: Items [5]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 1, 2, 3, 6]

The final allocations in the specified JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
