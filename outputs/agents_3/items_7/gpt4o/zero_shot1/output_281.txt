Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  89  78  30  63  26  27
1  36  12  75  34  79  40  68
2  71  94  89  22  29  30  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6 89 78 30 63 26 27]
 [36 12 75 34 79 40 68]
 [71 94 89 22 29 30 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this:

1. **List each agent's valuation for each item:**

   - Agent 0: [6, 89, 78, 30, 63, 26, 27]
   - Agent 1: [36, 12, 75, 34, 79, 40, 68]
   - Agent 2: [71, 94, 89, 22, 29, 30, 99]

2. **Allocate items based on maximizing total valuation for each agent:**

   After evaluating the valuations, we can attempt different allocations to balance fairness and total valuation:

   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 4 and 2.
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 and 6.

3. **Attempt a fair allocation:**

   - Assign items based on the highest valuations where possible, ensuring each agent gets approximately equal value where possible:

     - Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
     - Agent 1: Items [3, 4]
     - Agent 2: Items [1, 5, 6]

4. **Verify the allocation:**

    - Agent 0 total valuation: 6 + 78 = 84
    - Agent 1 total valuation: 34 + 79 = 113
    - Agent 2 total valuation: 94 + 30 + 99 = 223

   This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share based on their preferences.

5. **Present the allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```
