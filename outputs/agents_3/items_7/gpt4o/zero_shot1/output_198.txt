Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  87  27  54  83  92  88
1  28  96  15  85  60  37  45
2  46  26  97  71  92  59  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[49 87 27 54 83 92 88]
 [28 96 15 85 60 37 45]
 [46 26 97 71 92 59 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation where each agent's total valuation of the items they receive is as balanced as possible. Let's evaluate the table and make a reasonable allocation:

Agent 0's valuations: [49, 87, 27, 54, 83, 92, 88]  
Agent 1's valuations: [28, 96, 15, 85, 60, 37, 45]  
Agent 2's valuations: [46, 26, 97, 71, 92, 59, 12]  

A potential allocation strategy is to try and maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Give item 1 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for them (96).
- Give item 2 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value for them (97).
- Give item 5 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for them (92).
- Give item 6 to Agent 0, as it has the next highest value for them (88).
- Give item 0 to Agent 2, as it has a good value for them (46) and the highest left.
- Give item 4 to Agent 1, as it has a good value for them (60) and a reasonable allocation.
- Give item 3 to Agent 2, as it has a reasonable value for them (71).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and the distribution is fairly balanced based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
