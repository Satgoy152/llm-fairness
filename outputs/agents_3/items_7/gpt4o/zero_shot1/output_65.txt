Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  71  29  59  64  52  32
1  91  55  11  21  19  32  97
2  53  94  85  88  12  10   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 71 29 59 64 52 32]
 [91 55 11 21 19 32 97]
 [53 94 85 88 12 10  2]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. We'll try to assign items so that the sum of valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.

To do this, we can follow these steps:

1. **Sort items by agent valuations**: Consider the highest valuations first for each agent.
2. **Allocate items**: Assign items to agents based on the highest available valuation that hasn't been assigned yet.
3. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Make sure all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item, if possible.

Here's a possible allocation based on the valuations provided:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest valuations: Item 1 (71), Item 4 (64), Item 3 (59)
- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest valuations: Item 0 (91), Item 6 (97), Item 5 (32)
- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest valuations: Item 1 (94), Item 2 (85), Item 3 (88)

Considering these, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (71), Item 4 (64)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (91), Item 6 (97)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (85), Item 3 (88), Item 5 (10)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
