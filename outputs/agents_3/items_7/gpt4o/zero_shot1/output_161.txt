Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  73   8  78  28  46  69
1  24  56  58  99  19   4  62
2  47  32  11  93  47  73  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the satisfaction of each agent or balance the total value of items received by each agent. Since each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be distributed, let's start by evaluating the agents' preferences and try to balance the distribution.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Determine Priorities:** Calculate the sum of valuations for each agent to see if there's a significant disparity in total preferences.
   - Agent 0 total valuation: 55 + 73 + 8 + 78 + 28 + 46 + 69 = 357
   - Agent 1 total valuation: 24 + 56 + 58 + 99 + 19 + 4 + 62 = 322
   - Agent 2 total valuation: 47 + 32 + 11 + 93 + 47 + 73 + 43 = 346

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item initially.
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (55).
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (73).
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (58).
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (99).
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (28).
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (73).
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (69).

3. **Adjust Allocation to Ensure Fairness:**
   - Check if any agent can receive an item they value significantly more than their current allocation to balance the total value.
   - Redistribute so that each agent has a similar total valuation if possible.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 4
   - Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3
   - Agent 2 receives items: 5, 6

### JSON Format Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This distribution attempts to balance the total value of items received by each agent while ensuring every item is allocated.
