Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  42   7  88  90  15  88
1   1  18  23  85  52  24   4
2  91  73  42  52  60  99  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the values each agent places on the items and aim for a distribution where each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items fairly:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** has a decent valuation for item 2, which Agent 0 values less.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 0, 5, and 1.

Based on these observations, a possible fair allocation could be:

- Assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 2 and 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 0, 1, and 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation takes into account the higher valuations each agent has for certain items while ensuring each agent receives items.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
