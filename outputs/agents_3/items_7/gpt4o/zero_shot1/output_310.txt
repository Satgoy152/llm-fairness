Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  76  15  20  12  30  21
1  81  27  64   5  75  30  46
2   0  78  48  17  11  96  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 76 15 20 12 30 21]
 [81 27 64  5 75 30 46]
 [ 0 78 48 17 11 96 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 valuations: [42, 76, 15, 20, 12, 30, 21]
- Agent 1 valuations: [81, 27, 64, 5, 75, 30, 46]
- Agent 2 valuations: [0, 78, 48, 17, 11, 96, 57]

A possible allocation strategy is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 81.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 78.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 64.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 20.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 75.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 96.
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 57.

Let's assign items based on these valuations:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 4]
- Agent 2: [1, 5, 6]

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated and attempts to give each agent items they value highly.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```
