Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  37  85  31  20  15  69
1  97  78  24  78  21  12  87
2  13  74  46  65  68  82  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes total satisfaction (the sum of valuations each agent receives for their allocated items). A common approach is to use an algorithmic method like a greedy algorithm or another fair allocation strategy. Here, we'll consider maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most (85), so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (97), so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the most (82), so allocate item 5 to agent 2.
4. Next, allocate item 6 to agent 1, as they value it highly (87).
5. Allocate item 1 to agent 2, as they value it highly (74).
6. Allocate item 3 to agent 2, as they value it highly (65).
7. Finally, allocate item 4 to agent 2, as they value it highly (68).

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total allocation is 7 items.
