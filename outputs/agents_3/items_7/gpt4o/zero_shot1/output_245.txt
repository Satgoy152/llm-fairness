Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  19  63  44  61   5  21
1  61  55  33  86  20  42  30
2  90  45  58  21  60  40  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 19 63 44 61  5 21]
 [61 55 33 86 20 42 30]
 [90 45 58 21 60 40 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that every item is assigned to one of the agents. One way to achieve this is by considering each agent's highest-valued items and assigning them accordingly, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the total items. 

Let's analyze the values each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0 values: [89, 19, 63, 44, 61, 5, 21]
- Agent 1 values: [61, 55, 33, 86, 20, 42, 30]
- Agent 2 values: [90, 45, 58, 21, 60, 40, 16]

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is 89 for item 0. We allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is 86 for item 3. We allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is 90 for item 0, but item 0 is already allocated. Next highest is 60 for item 4. We allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 1, 2, 5, 6.

4. **Agent 0**: Next highest available is 63 for item 2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 1**: Next highest available is 55 for item 1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 2**: Next highest available is 58 for item 2, but item 2 is already allocated. Next is 45 for item 1, but item 1 is also allocated. Next is 40 for item 5. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
7. **Agent 0**: Next highest available is 21 for item 6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

After allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 5]

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly, considering each agent's values.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
