Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  11  34  94   6  21  23
1  30  16  77  40  19  86  58
2  67  28  56  87  84  93  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [67 28 56 87 84 93 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least some items. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Prioritize items with the highest value for this agent.
   - Item 3 has the highest value for agent 0 (94). 
   - Item 2 is the next highest value (34).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Prioritize items with the highest value for agent 1.
   - Item 5 has the highest value for agent 1 (86).
   - Item 2 is already taken, so the next highest is item 1 (16).
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Prioritize items with the highest value for agent 2.
   - Item 5 is already taken, so the next highest is item 6 (85).
   - Item 4 is the next highest value (84).

Here's a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [6, 4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7.
