Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  91  22  85  14  57  46
1  29  82  95  61   8   8  55
2  61  96  15  96  27  60  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 1 91 22 85 14 57 46]
 [29 82 95 61  8  8 55]
 [61 96 15 96 27 60 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We need to find a distribution where each agent receives a reasonable share of high-valued items according to their preferences.

Here are the valuations again for clarity:

- Agent 0: [1, 91, 22, 85, 14, 57, 46]
- Agent 1: [29, 82, 95, 61, 8, 8, 55]
- Agent 2: [61, 96, 15, 96, 27, 60, 90]

Let's allocate items to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent:

1. **Agent 2** shows high preference for items 1, 3, and 6, with valuations 96, 96, and 90 respectively. Let's allocate these items to Agent 2.

2. **Agent 0** has a high preference for item 1 (already taken by Agent 2) and item 3 (also taken by Agent 2). The next highest preferences are for item 0 (value 1), item 4 (value 14), item 5 (value 57), and item 6 (value 46), but item 6 is already taken. Thus, let's allocate items 5 and 0 to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 1** highly values item 2, with a valuation of 95. As item 2 is still available, we will allocate item 2 to Agent 1. The next highest available item is item 4 with a value of 8, so we can allocate item 4 to Agent 1 as well.

Let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 0
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 3, 6

Here's the JSON output for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their valuations, with a total of 7 items allocated.
