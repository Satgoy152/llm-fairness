Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  79   0  30  44  74  29
1  22  23  60  39   8  42  70
2  58  93  88  34  68  80  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, given there are 7 items and 3 agents. Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5. However, since we need to allocate items to all agents fairly, we'll choose a combination that considers the overall distribution.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 and 6. We should try to allocate at least one of these items to Agent 1 to maximize their satisfaction.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 5. Since item 1 is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 2, and item 2 is highly valued by Agent 1 and Agent 2, we'll need to choose wisely to keep all agents satisfied.

Here's a possible allocation that attempts to balance these considerations:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 5.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 2 and 6.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 1, 3, and 4.

This allocation aims to distribute the items to maximize the valuations fairly while ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share of their high-value items.

The allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
