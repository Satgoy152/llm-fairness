Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  95  17  47  36  34  46
1  98  94  81  67  27  17  38
2  72  30  88  88  39  25  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[47 95 17 47 36 34 46]
 [98 94 81 67 27 17 38]
 [72 30 88 88 39 25 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that every item is allocated. A common approach is to use a form of the "maximum weight matching" in a bipartite graph, where one set of nodes represents agents and the other set represents items, with the edges weighted by the valuations.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **List the valuations for each item by each agent:**
   - Agent 0: [47, 95, 17, 47, 36, 34, 46]
   - Agent 1: [98, 94, 81, 67, 27, 17, 38]
   - Agent 2: [72, 30, 88, 88, 39, 25, 13]

2. **Sort items by the highest value an agent assigns to them:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 98
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 95
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 88
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 88
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 39
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 34
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 46

3. **Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:**
   - Item 0 to Agent 1 (value 98)
   - Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 95)
   - Item 2 to Agent 2 (value 88)
   - Item 3 to Agent 2 (value 88)
   - Item 4 to Agent 2 (value 39)
   - Item 5 to Agent 0 (value 34)
   - Item 6 to Agent 0 (value 46)

4. **Check the allocation:**
   - Agent 0 has items: 1, 5, 6
   - Agent 1 has item: 0
   - Agent 2 has items: 2, 3, 4

5. **Ensure total items allocated is 7, which it is.**

Now, present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
