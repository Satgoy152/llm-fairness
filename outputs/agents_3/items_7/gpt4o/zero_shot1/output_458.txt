Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  17  79  91  78  91  80
1  94  27  37  30  52  51  40
2  38  66  96  89  82  34  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 17 79 91 78 91 80]
 [94 27 37 30 52 51 40]
 [38 66 96 89 82 34 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, given that there are 3 agents and 7 items. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate each agent's total valuation for all items:
   - Agent 0: 91 + 17 + 79 + 91 + 78 + 91 + 80 = 527
   - Agent 1: 94 + 27 + 37 + 30 + 52 + 51 + 40 = 331
   - Agent 2: 38 + 66 + 96 + 89 + 82 + 34 + 73 = 478

2. Allocate items to maximize total value for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated:

- Start by assigning the highest value item available for each agent:
  - Agent 0: Item 0 (value 91)
  - Agent 1: Item 0 (value 94)
  - Agent 2: Item 2 (value 96)

3. Continue assigning items to maximize the total value across all agents:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 5 (values 91, 91, 91)
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 4 (values 27, 52)
   - Agent 2: Items 2, 6 (values 96, 73)

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent gets at least one item, all items are allocated, and the overall value distribution is fairly balanced among the agents.
