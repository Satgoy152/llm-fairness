Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  83  15  43  19  64  68
1   5  62  51  35  84   6  58
2  66  78  13  81  83  43  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76 83 15 43 19 64 68]
 [ 5 62 51 35 84  6 58]
 [66 78 13 81 83 43 82]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Determine Initial High-Value Assignments:**
   - Assign items to agents based on the highest individual valuations, aiming to give each agent at least one item initially.

2. **Fine-Tune Allocations:**
   - Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives a relatively fair share, considering their highest-valued items.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: Value 76
  - Item 6: Value 68

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 4: Value 84
  - Item 2: Value 51
  - Item 3: Value 35

- **Agent 2:**
  - Item 1: Value 78
  - Item 5: Value 43

This way, each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with each getting at least one of their preferred items. The allocation is balanced such that all 7 items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
