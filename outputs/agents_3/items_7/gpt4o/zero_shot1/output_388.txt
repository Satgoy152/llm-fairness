Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  84  19  59  20  36   1
1  92  60  48  14  37   3  30
2  11  14  32  81  79  81  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List Valuations**: First, let's list out the valuations for quick reference:
   - Agent 0: [54, 84, 19, 59, 20, 36, 1]
   - Agent 1: [92, 60, 48, 14, 37, 3, 30]
   - Agent 2: [11, 14, 32, 81, 79, 81, 39]

2. **Allocate Items**:
   - We can start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, ensuring that no item is assigned to more than one agent. 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (84).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (92).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most (81).

   So far, the allocation is:
   - Agent 0: Item 1
   - Agent 1: Item 0
   - Agent 2: Item 5

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Now, we have items [2, 3, 4, 6] left to allocate. We can continue assigning based on the next highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and maximizing overall satisfaction.

   - Agent 2 values item 3 next (81), then item 4 (79).
   - Agent 0 values item 3 next (59), but Agent 2 has a higher valuation for item 3.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 (48) and item 6 (30).

   Assign the remaining items based on maximizing the total value for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 1, Item 4
   - Agent 1: Item 0, Item 2, Item 6
   - Agent 2: Item 3, Item 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly while distributing the items evenly among agents.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is seven.
