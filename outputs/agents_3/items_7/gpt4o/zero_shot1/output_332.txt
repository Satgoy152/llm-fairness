Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  43   2  51  18  56  27
1  94  21  55  96  89  96  46
2  64  25  66   1   0  46  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 21 55 96 89 96 46]
 [64 25 66  1  0 46 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. We can use a greedy approach by iteratively assigning the highest-valued item that has not yet been allocated to the agent who values it most.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. First, identify the highest valuation for each item and allocate it to the corresponding agent.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item.
3. Adjust allocations to achieve a fair distribution.

### Allocation Process:
- **Item 0:** Highest valuation is 97 by Agent 0.
- **Item 1:** Highest valuation is 43 by Agent 0.
- **Item 2:** Highest valuation is 66 by Agent 2.
- **Item 3:** Highest valuation is 96 by Agent 1.
- **Item 4:** Highest valuation is 89 by Agent 1.
- **Item 5:** Highest valuation is 96 by Agent 1.
- **Item 6:** Highest valuation is 54 by Agent 2.

### Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 1]
- Agent 1: [3, 4, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 6]

This allocation doesn't perfectly balance the number of items, but it maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```
