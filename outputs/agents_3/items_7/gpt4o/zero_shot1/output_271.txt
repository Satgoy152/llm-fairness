Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  34  27  49  20  10  76
1  98  52  11  28  42  73  70
2  23  62  89  17   2  78  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55 34 27 49 20 10 76]
 [98 52 11 28 42 73 70]
 [23 62 89 17  2 78 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and exactly 7 items are allocated in total.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (76), Item 0 (55), Item 3 (49)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (98), Item 5 (73), Item 6 (70)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (91), Item 2 (89), Item 5 (78)

### Allocation:
- **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1:** Highest value for Agent 1.
- **Assign Item 6 to Agent 2:** Highest value for Agent 2.
- **Assign Item 5 to Agent 2:** Second highest value for Agent 2.
- **Assign Item 3 to Agent 0:** High value for Agent 0.
- **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0:** High value for Agent 0.
- **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1:** Moderate value for Agent 1, remaining after other high value items.
- **Assign Item 2 to Agent 2:** High value for Agent 2, remaining after other allocations.

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
This allocation ensures a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations while keeping the total number of items allocated to 7.
