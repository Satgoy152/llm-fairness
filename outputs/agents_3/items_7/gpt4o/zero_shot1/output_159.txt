Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  37  72  81  11  20  36
1  98  60  72  15  13   8  80
2  66  26  42  31  99  30   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach to this problem is to use the "maximum sum valuation" method or some variation of the "fair division" method, such as the "envy-free" approach if possible.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0:
Item 0: 0
Item 1: 37
Item 2: 72
Item 3: 81
Item 4: 11
Item 5: 20
Item 6: 36

Agent 1:
Item 0: 98
Item 1: 60
Item 2: 72
Item 3: 15
Item 4: 13
Item 5: 8
Item 6: 80

Agent 2:
Item 0: 66
Item 1: 26
Item 2: 42
Item 3: 31
Item 4: 99
Item 5: 30
Item 6: 7
```

To maximize fairness, each agent should receive items which are of the highest value to them compared to other agents. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: Item 3 (value 81), Item 2 (value 72)
   - Allocation: [2, 3]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: Item 0 (value 98), Item 6 (value 80), Item 1 (value 60)
   - Allocation: [0, 6, 1]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: Item 4 (value 99), Item 5 (value 30)
   - Allocation: [4, 5]

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent given the constraints. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 6, 1],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
