Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  96  81  59  25   7  77
1  21  42  43  28  86  84  33
2  78  43  59   9  20  90   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Below are the steps taken to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 at 21, and Agent 2 at 78.
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 at 42, and Agent 2 at 43.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 at 43, and Agent 2 at 59.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 at 28, and Agent 2 at 9.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 at 86, and Agent 2 at 20.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 7, Agent 1 at 84, and Agent 2 at 90.
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 at 33, and Agent 2 at 0.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

After assigning items based on the highest valuations, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that all 7 items are allocated.
