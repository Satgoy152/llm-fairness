Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  46   4  72  89  81  66
1  60  80  62  32  90  52  10
2  70  36  15  81  80  24   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78 46  4 72 89 81 66]
 [60 80 62 32 90 52 10]
 [70 36 15 81 80 24  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent based on the given valuations. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent a turn to pick their most valued item that hasn't been chosen yet, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.
2. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0's highest valuations: Item 4 (89), Item 5 (81), Item 0 (78), Item 3 (72), Item 6 (66), Item 1 (46), Item 2 (4).
- Agent 1's highest valuations: Item 4 (90), Item 1 (80), Item 2 (62), Item 0 (60), Item 5 (52), Item 3 (32), Item 6 (10).
- Agent 2's highest valuations: Item 3 (81), Item 4 (80), Item 0 (70), Item 1 (36), Item 5 (24), Item 2 (15), Item 6 (7).

Now, let's assign the items:

1. Agent 0 takes Item 4 (89).
2. Agent 1 takes Item 1 (80).
3. Agent 2 takes Item 3 (81).
4. Agent 0 takes Item 0 (78).
5. Agent 1 takes Item 2 (62).
6. Agent 2 takes Item 5 (24).
7. Agent 0 takes Item 6 (66).

This way, each agent gets a fair chance to pick based on their preference, and all items are allocated.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
