Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96   6  74  25  69  58  39
1   8  58  56  95  68  50  29
2  15  80  77  34   7  15  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider how we can maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Valuations:** Review the valuations each agent has for each item.

2. **Maximize Total Value:** Try to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives.

3. **Allocate Items:** Considering the constraints that each agent gets an integer number of items and only 7 items are allocated in total, ensure a balanced and fair distribution.

Let's allocate the items:

- Start by assigning the highest value items to each agent, trying to maximize their total value.
- Adjust if needed to ensure each agent receives items and all items are allocated.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0:** Highest values are for items 0, 2, and 4.
- **Agent 1:** Highest values are for items 3 and 1.
- **Agent 2:** Highest values are for items 6 and 5.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 2
- **Agent 1:** Items 3, 1
- **Agent 2:** Items 6, 5, 4

This ensures a fair distribution while maximizing each agentâ€™s value.

### JSON Format Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [6, 5, 4]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and provides a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
