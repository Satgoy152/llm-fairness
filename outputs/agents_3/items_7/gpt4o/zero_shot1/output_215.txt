Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  23  44   6  69  89  35
1  32  70  91  78  18  22  65
2  79  63  48  51  35  24  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations, ensuring that all items are allocated. One possible approach to achieve this is by considering maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's evaluate the best possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (89), Item 0 (78)
   - Allocation: [0, 5]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (91), Item 3 (78)
   - Allocation: [2, 3]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 6 (97), Item 1 (63), Item 4 (35)
   - Allocation: [6, 1, 4]

Now, let's check the total number of items:

- Items allocated to Agent 0: 2 items
- Items allocated to Agent 1: 2 items
- Items allocated to Agent 2: 3 items

Total: 7 items allocated.

This allocation is fair based on maximizing each agent's preference for items where possible. Now, let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [6, 1, 4]
}
```

This ensures each agent has been considered, and all items have been allocated fairly.
