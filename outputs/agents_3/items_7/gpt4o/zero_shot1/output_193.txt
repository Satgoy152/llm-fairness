Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  93  12  11  46  31  87
1  82  79  81   6   8  18  93
2  50  27  20  65  68  55  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84 93 12 11 46 31 87]
 [82 79 81  6  8 18 93]
 [50 27 20 65 68 55 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach to achieve fairness is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, since we have 7 items and 3 agents. We can use a simple greedy algorithm to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each agent:

1. Assign each agent at least one item by choosing the one with the highest valuation for that agent.
2. Allocate the remaining items by considering which agent values the available items the most.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign item 1 (valuation 93) and item 6 (valuation 87).
- Agent 1: Assign item 0 (valuation 82) and item 2 (valuation 81).
- Agent 2: Assign item 3 (valuation 65), item 4 (valuation 68), and item 5 (valuation 55).

Now, let's format this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations, and all 7 items are allocated.
