Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  54  24   0  72  43  67
1  69  95  83   4  24   8  92
2  96  54   2  96  20  59  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [69 95 83  4 24  8 92]
 [96 54  2 96 20 59 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We need to consider the valuations of all items by each agent and try to assign items such that the total valuation is maximized for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's evaluate the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (72), Item 6 (67), Item 1 (54)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (95), Item 6 (92), Item 2 (83)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (96), Item 3 (96), Item 5 (59)

Considering these valuations, we can proceed with the following allocation:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value 95).
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (second highest value 92).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value 96).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (second highest value 96).
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (third highest value 59).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value 72 for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (third highest value 83 for Agent 1).

By following this allocation, we ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and we try to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
