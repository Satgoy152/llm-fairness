Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  82   4  58  88   3  99
1  86  71  77  27   0   6  97
2  99   7  96  73  28  29  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to let each agent choose their most valued item, then proceed to the next most valued item that hasn't been chosen, and so on, until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process based on the valuations:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items**: 
   - Item 6 (value: 99)
   - Item 4 (value: 88)
   - Item 1 (value: 82)

2. **Agent 1's highest valued items**:
   - Item 0 (value: 86)
   - Item 6 (value: 97) - already taken by Agent 0
   - Item 2 (value: 77)

3. **Agent 2's highest valued items**:
   - Item 0 (value: 99) - already taken by Agent 1
   - Item 6 (value: 99) - already taken by Agent 0
   - Item 2 (value: 96)

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 6 (value: 99)
  - Item 4 (value: 88)
  
- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0 (value: 86)
  - Item 2 (value: 77)
  
- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 3 (value: 73)
  - Item 5 (value: 29)
  - Item 1 (value: 7)

Now, let's represent this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 5, 1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated.
