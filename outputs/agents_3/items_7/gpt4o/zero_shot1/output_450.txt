Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  28  61  47   2  19  40
1  28  51  76  53  45  22   5
2  71  63  52  96  44   9  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we'll consider the valuations each agent has for each item. One approach is to maximize the total value across all agents or ensure that each agent gets items maximizing their personal valuations while also ensuring that each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. Given there are 7 items and 3 agents, one potential allocation could be 2 items each for two agents and 3 items to the third agent.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2 (61) and item 6 (40).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 2 (76) and item 3 (53).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 3 (96).

We want to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. 

A possible allocation strategy:
- Assign the highest-valued items to each agent first.
- Then, allocate the remaining items, ensuring each agent gets a roughly equal number of items.

**Allocation:**
- Agent 0: [0, 6]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 4]
- Agent 2: [3, 5]

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's value received and ensures that all items are distributed.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
