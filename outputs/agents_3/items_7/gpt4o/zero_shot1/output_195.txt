Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  61  26  82  53  88  71
1  58  49  18  31  29  66  50
2  56  65   1   1  59  12  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [56 65  1  1 59 12 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, ensuring that all items are allocated. Let's consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets an optimal set of items according to their preferences:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items: 5 (88), 3 (82), and 1 (61).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items: 0 (58), 5 (66), and 6 (50).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items: 1 (65), 4 (59), and 0 (56).

Considering these preferences, we can try to allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valued items are 5 and 3. We can assign these to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it is one of their highest valued items.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it is one of their highest valued items.

Next, we need to consider the remaining items 2, 4, and 6:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as it is one of their next highest valued items.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it is one of their next highest valued items.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 has a relatively higher valuation for item 2 compared to the others.

This allocation looks balanced based on the agents' valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 2],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, all 7 items are allocated, and the distribution considers the agents' preferences.
