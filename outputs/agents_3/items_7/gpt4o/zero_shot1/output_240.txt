Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  30  41   7  19  42  50
1  16   1  49  46  73  25  97
2  20  46  74  36  45  89  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[51 30 41  7 19 42 50]
 [16  1 49 46 73 25 97]
 [20 46 74 36 45 89 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. To do this, we can use a method similar to the "maximum weight matching" problem in bipartite graphs, where one set of nodes represents agents and the other set represents items, with edge weights defined by the valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [51, 30, 41, 7, 19, 42, 50]
Agent 1: [16, 1, 49, 46, 73, 25, 97]
Agent 2: [20, 46, 74, 36, 45, 89, 14]
```

Let's allocate the items to maximize each agent's total valuation:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 6 (97), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 5 (89), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2 (74), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 4 (73), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 0 (51), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1 (46), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
7. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 (7), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes the total valuation for the items they receive.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
