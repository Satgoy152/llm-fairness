Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  46  77  26  58  45  57
1  38  81  55  24  37   0  56
2  65  49  76   1  90  22  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 49 76  1 90 22 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction or value for all agents. One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. 

Let's go through each item and allocate it to the agent with the highest valuation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 21
   - Agent 1 values it at 38
   - Agent 2 values it at 65
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest valuation)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 46
   - Agent 1 values it at 81
   - Agent 2 values it at 49
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 77
   - Agent 1 values it at 55
   - Agent 2 values it at 76
   - **Allocate to Agent 0**

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 26
   - Agent 1 values it at 24
   - Agent 2 values it at 1
   - **Allocate to Agent 0**

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 58
   - Agent 1 values it at 37
   - Agent 2 values it at 90
   - **Allocate to Agent 2**

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 45
   - Agent 1 values it at 0
   - Agent 2 values it at 22
   - **Allocate to Agent 0**

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 57
   - Agent 1 values it at 56
   - Agent 2 values it at 97
   - **Allocate to Agent 2**

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4, 6]
}
```
