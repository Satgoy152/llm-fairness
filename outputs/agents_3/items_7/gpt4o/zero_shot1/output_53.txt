Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53   0  28  26  74  79  41
1  38  59  30  22  65   4  27
2  22  55  39  72  58   3  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we want to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents based on their preferences. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 53.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 59.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 30.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 72.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 74.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 79.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 83.

Based on these valuations, the allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2
- Agent 2: Items 3, 6

Now, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```
