Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  16  26  91  65  93  86
1  93  17  42  79  81  26  91
2  17  33  17  97   0  74  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We'll consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that the total value is maximized or at least fairly balanced.

Here's one potential allocation approach:

- **Agent 0**: Has high valuation for item 3 (91), item 5 (93), and item 6 (86).
- **Agent 1**: Has high valuation for item 0 (93), item 4 (81), and item 6 (91).
- **Agent 2**: Has high valuation for item 3 (97) and item 5 (74).

Let's attempt to allocate these items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 3 (value: 91)
   - Item 6 (value: 86)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0 (value: 93)
   - Item 4 (value: 81)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 5 (value: 74)

This allocation considers the highest valuations each agent has and attempts to ensure a fair distribution. Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- **Remaining items**: Item 1, Item 2

To allocate these remaining items, let's consider their valuations:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 1: 16
  - Item 2: 26

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 1: 17
  - Item 2: 42

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 1: 33
  - Item 2: 17

Now, distribute these remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction:

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 1 (value: 33)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 2 (value: 42)

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, the total number of items allocated is 7, and the distribution is reasonably fair based on their valuations.
