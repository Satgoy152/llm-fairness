Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  43  71  56  45  50  53
1  56  80  87  79  44  31  33
2  62   6  16  12  70  45  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. We'll use a common heuristic called the "maximum sum" approach, which involves assigning items to the agents to maximize the sum of their valuations.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Create a List of Valuations:** Weâ€™ll list each agent's valuation for every item.
2. **Iterate Over the Items:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. **Ensure Fair Allocation:** Since there are 7 items and 3 agents, we aim to ensure a balanced allocation across the agents, where possible.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the provided valuations:

- **Item 0:** Agent 2 values it the most at 62.
- **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it the most at 80.
- **Item 2:** Agent 1 values it the most at 87.
- **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it the most at 79.
- **Item 4:** Agent 2 values it the most at 70.
- **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it the most at 50.
- **Item 6:** Agent 2 values it the most at 64.

Now, let's ensure each agent has at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7:

- Agent 0: Initially has 1 item (Item 5).
- Agent 1: Currently has 3 items (Items 1, 2, 3).
- Agent 2: Currently has 3 items (Items 0, 4, 6).

Each agent has at least one item, and all 7 items have been allocated. This allocation is balanced, given the constraints.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4, 6]
}
```
