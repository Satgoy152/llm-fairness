Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  55   0  18   9  47  12
1  93  67  81  24  18  97  88
2  60  80  63  97  84  37  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. We'll examine the valuations and allocate items to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by allocating items to the agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, but prioritize maximizing the total value.

Looking at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (82).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (97).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (97).

Allocate the highest valued items first based on this observation:

- Item 0 goes to Agent 0.
- Item 5 goes to Agent 1.
- Item 3 goes to Agent 2.

Now allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest available values:

- Agent 1 values item 6 the next highest (88).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the next highest (84).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the next highest (80).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the next highest (81).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [5, 6, 2]
- Agent 2: [3, 4, 1]

This results in each agent receiving items that provide a high value based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 6, 2],
    "2": [3, 4, 1]
}
```
