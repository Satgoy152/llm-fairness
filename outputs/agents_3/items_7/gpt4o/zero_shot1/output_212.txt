Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  74  37  75  27  65  86
1  34  99  23  40  79   6  83
2  30  74  21  15  33  60  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 6 (value 86).
   - The next highest is item 3 (value 75).
   - Hence, allocate items 6 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 1 (value 99).
   - The next highest is item 4 (value 79).
   - Allocate items 1 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 5 (value 60).
   - The next highest is item 0 (value 30).
   - Allocate items 5 and 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 2 is left unallocated. The remaining agents have the following values for item 2:
     - Agent 0: 37
     - Agent 1: 23
     - Agent 2: 21
   - The highest valuation for item 2 is by Agent 0. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, all items are allocated, and the distribution is done while considering the valuations of the agents.
