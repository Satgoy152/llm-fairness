Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  89  66  84  37  13  42
1  11  77  52  21  18  33  56
2  85  15  95  63  91  64  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 89 66 84 37 13 42]
 [11 77 52 21 18 33 56]
 [85 15 95 63 91 64 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One way to do this is to use a greedy approach, assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 99.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 89.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 84.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 91.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 64.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 70.

Now, let's proceed with the allocation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Assign item 6 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
