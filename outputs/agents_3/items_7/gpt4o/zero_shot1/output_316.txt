Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  28  96  87  49  40  54
1  10  97   5  81  31  25  83
2  66  61  22   9  62   9  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[61 28 96 87 49 40 54]
 [10 97  5 81 31 25 83]
 [66 61 22  9 62  9 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider both the valuations of the items and try to balance the total number of items allocated to each agent. There are several ways to approach this problem, but one simple method is to allocate based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's review the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [61, 28, 96, 87, 49, 40, 54]
Agent 1: [10, 97, 5, 81, 31, 25, 83]
Agent 2: [66, 61, 22, 9, 62, 9, 14]
```

We can start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent, ensuring that every agent receives at least one item if possible, and then adjust further to balance the allocation.

1. **Agent 0:** Has the highest valuation for item 2 (96).
2. **Agent 1:** Has the highest valuation for item 1 (97).
3. **Agent 2:** Has the highest valuation for item 0 (66).

After this initial allocation:
- Agent 0 has item 2
- Agent 1 has item 1
- Agent 2 has item 0

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (3, 4, 5, 6) to balance the allocations and maximize the total valuation:

4. **Agent 0:** Next highest is item 3 (87).
5. **Agent 1:** Next highest is item 6 (83).
6. **Agent 2:** Next highest is item 4 (62).

Now, remaining unallocated item is 5. Check the highest valuation for this item:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 5 at 40
- **Agent 1:** Values item 5 at 25
- **Agent 2:** Values item 5 at 9

Allocate item 5 to **Agent 0**.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items: 2, 3, 5
- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 6
- Agent 2 gets items: 0, 4

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
