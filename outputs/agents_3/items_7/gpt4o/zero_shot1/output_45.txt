Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  13  71  20  17  39   9
1  74  60  92  46  88  72  56
2  72  74  99  99  78  21  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 13 71 20 17 39  9]
 [74 60 92 46 88 72 56]
 [72 74 99 99 78 21 10]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value 99
   - Item 5: Value 39

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2: Value 92
   - Item 4: Value 88
   - Item 6: Value 56

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 1: Value 74
   - Item 3: Value 99

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least two items, and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
