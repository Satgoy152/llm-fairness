Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  70  99  52  23  61  13
1  17  71  38  61  90  53  66
2  36  20  56  85  31  22   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's consider the following approach: allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. If there's a tie, we break it by considering other allocations to maintain fairness and balance.

1. Evaluate each item's valuations:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (6), Agent 1 (17), Agent 2 (36) → Assign to Agent 2.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (70), Agent 1 (71), Agent 2 (20) → Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (99), Agent 1 (38), Agent 2 (56) → Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (52), Agent 1 (61), Agent 2 (85) → Assign to Agent 2.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (23), Agent 1 (90), Agent 2 (31) → Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (61), Agent 1 (53), Agent 2 (22) → Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (13), Agent 1 (66), Agent 2 (5) → Assign to Agent 1.

2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item. If any agent is left without an item, shift allocations from agents with more than one item to balance the distribution.

3. Based on the above considerations, the allocation is:
   - Agent 0: Items 2, 5
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 6
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 3

Now, presenting the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
