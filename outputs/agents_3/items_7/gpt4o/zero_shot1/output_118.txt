Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  15  27  73  59  33   1
1  48  38  47  61  88  88  68
2  96  75  71  59  84  87  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[14 15 27 73 59 33  1]
 [48 38 47 61 88 88 68]
 [96 75 71 59 84 87 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. A common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each item is allocated exactly once.

Let's consider the valuations given for each agent:

- Agent 0: [14, 15, 27, 73, 59, 33, 1]
- Agent 1: [48, 38, 47, 61, 88, 88, 68]
- Agent 2: [96, 75, 71, 59, 84, 87, 14]

Now, let's aim to allocate the items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.

1. Start by allocating items with the highest valuation to the respective agents, provided it does not result in an imbalance of items.
2. Continue allocating items to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

Here is one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [4, 5]
- Agent 2: [0, 1, 2, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 6]
}
```
