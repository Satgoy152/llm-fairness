Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24   3  35  13  96  46  65
1  49  74  79  33  87  44  80
2  29  79  99  10  70  68  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29 79 99 10 70 68 80]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can follow a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation from their assigned items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initial Assignment Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Identify the highest valuation each agent has for any item and assign that item to the agent if it's not already assigned.
   - Agent 0: Highest valuation is for item 4 (96).
   - Agent 1: Highest valuation is for item 2 (79).
   - Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 2 (99), but since item 2 is already taken by Agent 1, we assign the next highest, item 1 (79).

2. **Assign Remaining Items:**
   - We have now items 0, 3, 5, and 6 left to assign.
   - Next, we consider the next highest valuations and assign:
     - Item 3 to Agent 0 (13 is the highest among available items for Agent 0).
     - Item 5 to Agent 2 (68 is the highest among available items for Agent 2).
     - Item 0 to Agent 1 (49 is the highest among available items for Agent 1).
     - Item 6 to Agent 2 (80 is the highest among available items for Agent 2).

3. **Final Allocation Check:**
   - Ensure each agent receives at least one item.
   - Ensure all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

Each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
