Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  57  64  32  46  62  79
1  38  47  16  57  98  85  36
2  19  91  26  80  21  93  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The objective is to ensure that each agent receives items that have the highest possible value to them while distributing all 7 items.

Let's analyze the valuations of each agent for the items:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 23
- Item 1: 57
- Item 2: 64
- Item 3: 32
- Item 4: 46
- Item 5: 62
- Item 6: 79

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 38
- Item 1: 47
- Item 2: 16
- Item 3: 57
- Item 4: 98
- Item 5: 85
- Item 6: 36

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 19
- Item 1: 91
- Item 2: 26
- Item 3: 80
- Item 4: 21
- Item 5: 93
- Item 6: 84

An effective strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 38 (Agent 1)
2. Item 1: Highest value is 91 (Agent 2)
3. Item 2: Highest value is 64 (Agent 0)
4. Item 3: Highest value is 80 (Agent 2)
5. Item 4: Highest value is 98 (Agent 1)
6. Item 5: Highest value is 93 (Agent 2)
7. Item 6: Highest value is 84 (Agent 2)

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
