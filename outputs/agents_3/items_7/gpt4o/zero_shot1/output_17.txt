Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36   2  28  56  17  55  32
1  98  88   0  37  23   5  28
2  48  65  49  16  73  92  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. This approach ensures that each agent gets items that they value relatively more compared to others. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Allocations:**
   - For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
   - Assign the item to that agent if it does not result in an unfair distribution of total items.

2. **Ensure Fair Distribution:**
   - If any agent ends up with more than their fair share, consider reallocating items to other agents who value them next highest.

3. **Apply the Allocation:**
   - Each agent should ideally receive about 2 to 3 items, given there are 3 agents and 7 items.

Let's analyze the table and allocate:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (56), assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (98), assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (95), assign item 6 to agent 2.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the second most (88), assign item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the second most (92), assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 0 values item 2 the next highest (28), assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the next highest (73), assign item 4 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least two items, and the items are distributed based on the highest valuations.

Now, present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [6, 5, 4]
}
```
