Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  28  15  36  56  44   5
1  12  37  45  11  66  18  44
2  23  20  23  30  56  11  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share according to their valuations. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.

Here's one potential allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 36 + 28 + 15 + 36 + 56 + 44 + 5 = 220
   - Agent 1: 12 + 37 + 45 + 11 + 66 + 18 + 44 = 233
   - Agent 2: 23 + 20 + 23 + 30 + 56 + 11 + 93 = 256

2. Allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring fairness:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 highly, so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 highly as well, but since it's allocated to Agent 0, allocate item 2 to Agent 1, which is their second-highest valued item.
   - Agent 2 values item 6 highly, so allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

3. Continue allocation considering remaining high-value items for each agent:
   - Agent 0 can also receive items 0 and 3, which are valuable to them.
   - Agent 1 receives items 1 and 5, which are reasonably valued for them.
   - Agent 2 receives item 2 and item 6, both are highly valued by them.

4. Final allocation:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 5
   - Agent 2: Items 2, 6

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value relatively highly while distributing all items.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```
