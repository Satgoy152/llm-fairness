Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  64  62  89  67  48  38
1  51   4  66  22  33  63  90
2  47  50  36  84  43  39  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim for a distribution that could be considered equitable based on these valuations. A common approach is to use a method like the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW), which seeks to maximize the product of utilities across agents, or simply try to ensure that the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [71, 64, 62, 89, 67, 48, 38]
- Agent 1: [51, 4, 66, 22, 33, 63, 90]
- Agent 2: [47, 50, 36, 84, 43, 39, 32]

We'll consider giving each agent at least one item and then try to distribute the remaining items to maximize fairness.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initial allocation**: Assign each agent the item they value the most:
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (89)
   - Agent 1: Item 6 (90)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (84) â€” However, item 3 is already assigned to Agent 0, so we choose the next highest value for Agent 2 which is item 1 (50).

2. **Remaining items**: Items 0, 2, 4, and 5 are remaining. We should distribute these to maximize fairness.

3. **Consider remaining allocations**:
   - Agent 0 has already been allocated their highest-valued item.
   - Agent 1 could benefit from item 5 (63).
   - Agent 2 could take item 2 (36) as it provides a reasonable value.

4. **Final allocation of remaining items**:
   - Item 0 can be allocated to Agent 0.
   - Item 4 can be allocated to Agent 0.
   - Item 5 can be allocated to Agent 1.
   - Item 2 can be allocated to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This distribution aims to respect the high valuations each agent places on their assigned items while ensuring that every item is allocated.
