Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  92  65  88  92  49  35
1  74   5  64  44  70  61  10
2  63   4  51  30  41  60  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 92 65 88 92 49 35]
 [74  5 64 44 70 61 10]
 [63  4 51 30 41 60 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the "maximum sum allocation" approach, which aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives based on their preferences.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [35, 92, 65, 88, 92, 49, 35]
- Agent 1: [74, 5, 64, 44, 70, 61, 10]
- Agent 2: [63, 4, 51, 30, 41, 60, 19]

We'll allocate items based on the highest valuations, trying to ensure each agent gets items fairly:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 1 and 4 (both 92).
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (74).
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (60).

Now, distribute the remaining items trying to balance the total value:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 0
- Agent 2: Item 5

Remaining items [2, 3, 6] need to be distributed.

Considering remaining high valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (88)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (64)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (19)

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: [1, 4, 3]
- Agent 1: [0, 2]
- Agent 2: [5, 6]

Now, let's represent this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```
