Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  42  58  74  83  21  39
1  36  98   8  23  47  52  47
2  55  78  75   0  85   0  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 78 75  0 85  0 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 and item 4, so we allocate these items to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 and has moderate values for items 5 and 6, so we allocate these items to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for item 2 and item 3, so we allocate these items to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that they value relatively highly, and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint of distributing all 7 items among the 3 agents.
