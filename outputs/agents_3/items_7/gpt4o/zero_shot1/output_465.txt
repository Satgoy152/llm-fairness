Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  18  47  26   7  93  63
1  10  37  63  18  32  32  21
2  12  28  45  26  21  38  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 37 63 18 32 32 21]
 [12 28 45 26 21 38 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation by each agent, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value for item 5 (93)
   - Second highest for item 6 (63)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value for item 2 (63)
   - Second highest for item 1 (37)
   - Third highest for item 4 (32)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value for item 0 (12)
   - Second highest for item 3 (26)

After these allocations based on the highest valuations, let's ensure that each item is allocated once and each agent gets at least one item where possible.

Now, let's review the allocations:

- Item 0: Agent 2
- Item 1: Agent 1
- Item 2: Agent 1
- Item 3: Agent 2
- Item 4: Agent 1
- Item 5: Agent 0
- Item 6: Agent 0

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
