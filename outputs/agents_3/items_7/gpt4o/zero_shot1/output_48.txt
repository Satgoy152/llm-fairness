Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  97  63  31  23  99  92
1  85  97  33  54  35  31  38
2  82  91  33  61  48  18  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim for a balanced distribution where each agent receives at least some value. One method to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is one possible fair allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [73, 97, 63, 31, 23, 99, 92]
   - Highest valuations: Item 5, Item 1, Item 6

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [85, 97, 33, 54, 35, 31, 38]
   - Highest valuations: Item 0, Item 3

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [82, 91, 33, 61, 48, 18, 21]
   - Highest valuations: Item 4, Item 2

Allocating based on the highest available value for each agent in a way that each agent gets an integer number of items:

- **Agent 0** receives items: 1, 5
- **Agent 1** receives items: 0, 3, 6
- **Agent 2** receives items: 2, 4

These allocations ensure each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 7.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
