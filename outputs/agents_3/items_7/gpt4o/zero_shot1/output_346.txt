Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34   8  84  79   1  62  29
1   9  46  10  19  41   3  96
2  61  56  74  79  54  17  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the preferences of each agent, we aim to distribute the items such that the allocations are as balanced as possible in terms of total value.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - High valuations: Item 2 (84), Item 3 (79)
- Agent 1:
  - High valuations: Item 6 (96), Item 1 (46)
- Agent 2:
  - High valuations: Item 3 (79), Item 2 (74)

To proceed, we can start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent based on their preferences, ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (tied highest value for Agent 2).

Now, allocate the remaining items by considering their next best options:

4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (next highest value for Agent 2).
5. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
7. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (next best choice for Agent 1).

This allocation gives each agent a fair distribution of items based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [6, 1, 4],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their individual valuations.
