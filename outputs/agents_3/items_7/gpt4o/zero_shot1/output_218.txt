Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  97  95  46  37  54  57
1  99  95  30  32   8  42  57
2  56  35  33  39  71  27  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [56 35 33 39 71 27 97]]
Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values are for items 1 (97), 2 (95), and 0 (88).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values are for items 0 (99), 1 (95), and 2 (30).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values are for items 6 (97), 4 (71), and 3 (39).

To allocate the items fairly while considering the agents' preferences:

- **Agent 0** can be allocated items 1 and 2, because these items have high valuation for Agent 0 and relatively lower valuations for other agents.
  
- **Agent 1** can be allocated items 0 and 3. Item 0 has the highest valuation for Agent 1, and item 3 is not as highly valued by others.

- **Agent 2** can be allocated items 4, 5, and 6. These items collectively have the highest valuation for Agent 2 compared to others.

Therefore, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```
