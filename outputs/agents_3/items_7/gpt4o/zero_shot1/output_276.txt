Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  58  42  13  28  69  28
1  27  23  11  51  41  22  28
2  65  93  49  44  60  78  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. The approach will involve assigning items based on the highest valuations first, ensuring no agent is left without an item, and all items are allocated.

Let's start assigning items based on the highest valuations:

1. Agent 2 values item 1 at 93, which is the highest valuation for any item across all agents. We assign item 1 to agent 2.
2. Agent 0 values item 5 at 69, which is the next highest. We assign item 5 to agent 0.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 at 78, but since item 5 is already allocated, we move to the next highest unallocated item, which is item 0 valued at 65 by agent 2. We assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. Agent 0 has item 2 valued at 42. We assign item 2 to agent 0.
5. Agent 1 has item 3 valued at 51. We assign item 3 to agent 1.
6. Agent 2 values item 4 at 60, which is the next highest. We assign item 4 to agent 2.
7. Finally, item 6 is valued at 28 by agents 0 and 1 equally, but since agent 0 already has two items, we assign item 6 to agent 1 to balance the allocation.

After assigning these items, we have:

- Agent 0 gets items [5, 2]
- Agent 1 gets items [3, 6]
- Agent 2 gets items [1, 0, 4]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 0, 4]
}
```
