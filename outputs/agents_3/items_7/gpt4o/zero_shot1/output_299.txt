Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  91  67  41   2  41  28
1  79  39  14  54  19  45  80
2  86  15   0  39  23   8  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is assigned. Let's analyze the values and allocate the items accordingly:

- First, we identify which agent values each item the most:

  - Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 86
  - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 91
  - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 67
  - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 54
  - Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 23
  - Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 45
  - Item 6: Agent 1 and Agent 2 both value it at 80

- Based on these valuations, we begin by allocating each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 7 and each agent receives at least one item.

- Possible allocation:
  - Agent 0 gets items [1, 2] (value = 91 + 67)
  - Agent 1 gets items [3, 5, 6] (value = 54 + 45 + 80)
  - Agent 2 gets items [0, 4] (value = 86 + 23)

By this allocation, all agents receive items and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
