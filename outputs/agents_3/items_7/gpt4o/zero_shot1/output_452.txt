Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  24  33  66  31  57  65
1  97  77  62  33  92   5   3
2  20  40  96   5   3  19  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [20 40 96  5  3 19 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We can apply the following steps:

1. Calculate the total valuation that each agent would receive for each possible allocation.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that maximizes their individual total valuations.
3. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.
4. Make sure all 7 items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocations for each agent:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 6.
- **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 4.
- **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest.

We can explore possible allocations:

1. **Assign item 0** to **Agent 1** (highest value).
2. **Assign item 1** to **Agent 1** (second highest value).
3. **Assign item 2** to **Agent 2** (highest value).
4. **Assign item 3** to **Agent 0** (highest value among remaining).
5. **Assign item 4** to **Agent 1** (highest value among remaining).
6. **Assign item 5** to **Agent 0** (highest value among remaining).
7. **Assign item 6** to **Agent 0** (highest value among remaining).

This allocation maximizes the individual total valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
