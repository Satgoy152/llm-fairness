Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  28   0  65  44  33  43
1  43  89  66  68  44  47  46
2  87  30  91  86  26  53  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. A possible approach is to assign items to agents in such a way that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation based on the highest valuations:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 values it at 87 (highest).
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 89 (highest).
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values it at 91 (highest).
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 2 values it at 86 (highest).
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 2.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agents 0 and 1 both value it at 44. Since agent 0 has no items yet, allocate item 4 to agent 0.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 2 values it at 53 (highest).
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 2.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 43 (highest).
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 0.

In this allocation, each agent ends up with a fair share of items based on their highest valuations.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
