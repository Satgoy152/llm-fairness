Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  54  37  51  89  44  14
1  45  23  82  45  94  33  81
2  74  26  82  77  98  99  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 26 82 77 98 99 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. This is a variant of the assignment problem which can be solved using various methods, including the Hungarian algorithm or heuristic approaches.

Given the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  54  37  51  89  44  14
1  45  23  82  45  94  33  81
2  74  26  82  77  98  99  75
```

We will allocate the items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the items, while ensuring each item is uniquely allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (89), Item 1 (54), Item 3 (51)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (Value: 89)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (94), Item 2 (82), Item 6 (81)
   - Item 4 is already allocated.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (Value: 82)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (99), Item 4 (98), Item 3 (77)
   - Item 4 is already allocated.
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2 (Value: 99)

Now, continue allocating the remaining items:

- Item 0:
  - Values: Agent 0 (38), Agent 1 (45), Agent 2 (74)
  - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 (Value: 74)

- Item 1:
  - Values: Agent 0 (54), Agent 1 (23), Agent 2 (26)
  - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (Value: 54)

- Item 3:
  - Values: Agent 0 (51), Agent 1 (45), Agent 2 (77)
  - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2 (Value: 77)

- Item 6:
  - Values: Agent 0 (14), Agent 1 (81), Agent 2 (75)
  - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1 (Value: 81)

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [5, 0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are uniquely assigned and each agent has an integer number of items.
