Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89   1  71  74  56  55  57
1  23  37   1   8  99  68  62
2  31  18  18  21  29  18  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89  1 71 74 56 55 57]
 [23 37  1  8 99 68 62]
 [31 18 18 21 29 18 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation of items for each agent while ensuring each agent receives items and the total number of items allocated is 7. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where, at each step, we assign the item to the agent who values it the most, provided that each agent receives at least one item. 

Let's go through the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuations: [89, 1, 71, 74, 56, 55, 57]
   - Highest value is item 0 with a value of 89.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuations: [23, 37, 1, 8, 99, 68, 62]
   - Highest value is item 4 with a value of 99.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations: [31, 18, 18, 21, 29, 18, 29]
   - Highest value is item 0, but it's already assigned. Next is item 6 with a value of 29. 

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 71, which is the highest remaining value for this item.
- **Item 3**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 74, which is the highest remaining value for this item.
- **Item 5**:
  - Agent 1 values it at 68, which is the highest remaining value for this item.
- **Item 1**:
  - Agent 1 values it at 37, which is the highest remaining value for this item.

The allocations are:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 4, 5]
- Agent 2: [6]

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [6]
}
```
