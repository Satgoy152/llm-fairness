Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  33  20  39  78  55  52
1  46  74  28  35  66  49  24
2   5  51  61  89  97  90  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21 33 20 39 78 55 52]
 [46 74 28 35 66 49 24]
 [ 5 51 61 89 97 90 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are distributed. A possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's examine the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  33  20  39  78  55  52
1  46  74  28  35  66  49  24
2   5  51  61  89  97  90  54
```

By examining each column, we assign the item to the agent with the highest value for that item:

- Item 0: The highest value is 46 (Agent 1).
- Item 1: The highest value is 74 (Agent 1).
- Item 2: The highest value is 61 (Agent 2).
- Item 3: The highest value is 89 (Agent 2).
- Item 4: The highest value is 97 (Agent 2).
- Item 5: The highest value is 90 (Agent 2).
- Item 6: The highest value is 54 (Agent 2).

Now, let's allocate the items to the agents based on the highest valuation:

- Agent 0 doesn't have any items with the highest value.
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 1].
- Agent 2 gets items [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each item is given to the agent who values it the most.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
