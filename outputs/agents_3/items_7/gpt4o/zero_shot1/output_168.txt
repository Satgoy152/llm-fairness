Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  36  52  50  84  96   3
1  16  92  88  65  60   6  67
2  43   3  92  95   3   8  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets a fair share of the total value of the items. One approach is to calculate the total value for each agent and try to allocate items so that the total value received by each agent is as close as possible.

First, we calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 33 + 36 + 52 + 50 + 84 + 96 + 3 = 354
- Agent 1: 16 + 92 + 88 + 65 + 60 + 6 + 67 = 394
- Agent 2: 43 + 3 + 92 + 95 + 3 + 8 + 42 = 286

Next, we allocate the items to achieve a fair distribution. We need to consider the value each agent assigns to the items and distribute the items so each agent gets a roughly equal share of their total valuation.

Let's do the allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent to ensure each gets a significant share of their total value:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 5 (value 96).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (value 92).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 3 (value 95).

2. Continue assigning items to balance the total value allocated to each agent:
   - Agent 0 also gets items 4 and 2, which they value at 84 and 52.
   - Agent 1 gets item 6, which they value at 67.
   - Agent 2 gets item 0, which they value at 43.

3. Check the distribution:
   - Agent 0 has items [5, 4, 2] with values [96, 84, 52] totaling to 232.
   - Agent 1 has items [1, 6] with values [92, 67] totaling to 159.
   - Agent 2 has items [3, 0] with values [95, 43] totaling to 138.

This distribution attempts to fairly allocate items based on the agents' valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
