Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37   1  81  37  82  23  54
1  59  65  30  77  11   5  41
2  19  42  11  75  67   7  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [19 42 11 75 67  7 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated.

Let's start by looking at the valuations for each item by each agent:

- For item 0: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 values it at 59, Agent 2 values it at 19.
- For item 1: Agent 0 values it at 1, Agent 1 values it at 65, Agent 2 values it at 42.
- For item 2: Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 values it at 30, Agent 2 values it at 11.
- For item 3: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 values it at 77, Agent 2 values it at 75.
- For item 4: Agent 0 values it at 82, Agent 1 values it at 11, Agent 2 values it at 67.
- For item 5: Agent 0 values it at 23, Agent 1 values it at 5, Agent 2 values it at 7.
- For item 6: Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 values it at 41, Agent 2 values it at 18.

Now, we can use a greedy approach to allocate items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring a fair distribution of items:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 59).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 65).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 81).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 77).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 82).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 23).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 54).

This allocation gives Agent 0 four items and Agent 1 three items, while Agent 2 receives no items due to their consistently lower valuations compared to the other agents.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": []
}
```
