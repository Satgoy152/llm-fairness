Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  54  74  74  19  36  66
1  80  81   8  81  59  41  30
2  83  78  84  58  97  77  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21 54 74 74 19 36 66]
 [80 81  8 81 59 41 30]
 [83 78 84 58 97 77 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives for the items they are assigned. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 83 (Agent 2)
2. Item 1: Highest value is 81 (Agent 1)
3. Item 2: Highest value is 84 (Agent 2)
4. Item 3: Highest value is 81 (Agent 1)
5. Item 4: Highest value is 97 (Agent 2)
6. Item 5: Highest value is 77 (Agent 2)
7. Item 6: Highest value is 84 (Agent 2)

Thus, the allocation would be:
- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
