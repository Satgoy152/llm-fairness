Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  51  42  78  30  55  50
1  59  12  83   1  68  88  48
2  77  37  48  77  54  94  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes total satisfaction or fairness. One common approach is to maximize the sum of the agents' valuations for the items they receive. Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [82, 51, 42, 78, 30, 55, 50]
Agent 1: [59, 12, 83, 1, 68, 88, 48]
Agent 2: [77, 37, 48, 77, 54, 94, 78]
```

To achieve a fair distribution, we can use a greedy approach, where we assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 82
   - Agent 1 values it at 59
   - Agent 2 values it at 77
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 51
   - Agent 1 values it at 12
   - Agent 2 values it at 37
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 42
   - Agent 1 values it at 83
   - Agent 2 values it at 48
   - Allocate to Agent 1

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 78
   - Agent 1 values it at 1
   - Agent 2 values it at 77
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 30
   - Agent 1 values it at 68
   - Agent 2 values it at 54
   - Allocate to Agent 1

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 55
   - Agent 1 values it at 88
   - Agent 2 values it at 94
   - Allocate to Agent 2

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 0 values it at 50
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Agent 2 values it at 78
   - Allocate to Agent 2

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among agents fairly based on their valuations.
