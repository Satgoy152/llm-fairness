Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  62  23  32  92  64  31
1  11  42  17  54  99  85  19
2  38   2   2  56  57   9  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 62 23 32 92 64 31]
 [11 42 17 54 99 85 19]
 [38  2  2 56 57  9 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I will consider maximizing the total valuation that each agent receives, while ensuring that every agent receives an integer number of items and that exactly 7 items are allocated.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 94, Agent 1 at 11, Agent 2 at 38.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 62, Agent 1 at 42, Agent 2 at 2.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 23, Agent 1 at 17, Agent 2 at 2.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 32, Agent 1 at 54, Agent 2 at 56.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 92, Agent 1 at 99, Agent 2 at 57.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values at 64, Agent 1 at 85, Agent 2 at 9.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values at 31, Agent 1 at 19, Agent 2 at 38.

A potential fair allocation can be achieved by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (valued highest by Agent 0 at 94).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (valued highest by Agent 0 at 62).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (valued highest by Agent 0 at 23).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (valued highest by Agent 2 at 56).
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (valued highest by Agent 1 at 99).
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (valued highest by Agent 1 at 85).
7. Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (valued highest by Agent 2 at 38).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, maximizing satisfaction for each agent based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```
