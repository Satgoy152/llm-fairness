Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  12  29  94  78  13  71
1  39  60  81  73  22  95  18
2  30  86  72  24  87  52  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[79 12 29 94 78 13 71]
 [39 60 81 73 22 95 18]
 [30 86 72 24 87 52 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One possible approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving this:

1. **List the valuations**: 
   - Agent 0: [79, 12, 29, 94, 78, 13, 71]
   - Agent 1: [39, 60, 81, 73, 22, 95, 18]
   - Agent 2: [30, 86, 72, 24, 87, 52, 50]

2. **Determine the optimal allocation**:
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items.

3. **Allocate items**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (Value: 79)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (Value: 86)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (Value: 81)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (Value: 94)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (Value: 87)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (Value: 95)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (Value: 71)

4. **Verify allocation**: Each agent should have at least one item, and all items should be allocated.

Here is the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring a fair distribution of items.
