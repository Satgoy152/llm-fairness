Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98   1  63  78  45  63  24
1  54  31  73   5  85  60  51
2  72  30  67  21  62  86  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54 31 73  5 85 60 51]
 [72 30 67 21 62 86 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from the items they are allocated, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated.

Let's allocate items as follows, focusing on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 2 and 4.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 5 and 6.

Based on these preferences, let's make an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 and Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 and Item 4
- **Agent 2**: Item 5, Item 6, and Item 1

This allocation considers the highest valuations each agent has for the available items, ensuring a fair distribution of the total value.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 6, 1]
}
```

This results in all items being allocated, with each agent receiving a meaningful set of items based on their preferences.
