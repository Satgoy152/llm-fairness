Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  99  56  69  58  49  30
1  95  72  63  59  75  92  92
2  23   1  60  29  75  65  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. We have 3 agents and 7 items, so one agent will receive 3 items while the other two agents receive 2 items each.

First, let's evaluate the highest valuations for each agent and allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (99), Item 3 (69)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (95), Item 5 (92), Item 6 (92)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (75), Item 6 (66)

Now let's allocate the items based on maximizing the total valuations:

- **Agent 0** receives items [1, 3]. (Valuations: 99, 69)
- **Agent 1** receives items [0, 5, 6]. (Valuations: 95, 92, 92)
- **Agent 2** receives items [2, 4]. (Valuations: 60, 75)

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives items based on their high valuations, while maintaining a fair distribution.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
