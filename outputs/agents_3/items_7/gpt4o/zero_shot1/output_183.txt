Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  73  51  81  69   8  42
1  65  96  54  59  84  46  39
2  49  72  81  84  28  84  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that the allocations are balanced and no agent receives an unfair advantage. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:** Determine which agent values each item the most. This can guide the allocation to maximize happiness.

2. **Allocate Based on Maximum Value:** Assign items to the agent that values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least 2 items because there are 3 agents and 7 items.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** After initial allocation, check the distribution to ensure fairness, making adjustments if necessary, so no agent is heavily favored.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (81).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (96).
- Agent 2 values items 2 and 5 the most (81 and 84, respectively).

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

- Assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to agent 1.
- Assign items 2 and 5 to agent 2 (since item 5 is equally valued by agent 0, we prioritize agent 2's high valuation elsewhere).

Now assign the remaining items (0, 4, 6) to balance the allocations:

- Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value 65).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 84).
- Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value 42).

Resulting allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 0, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, maximizing the total value each agent receives while keeping the distribution fair and balanced.
