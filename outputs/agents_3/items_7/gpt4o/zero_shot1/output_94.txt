Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  81  34  19  35  49  62
1  74  14  36  82  86  55  25
2  66  45  23   1  24  62  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[69 81 34 19 35 49 62]
 [74 14 36 82 86 55 25]
 [66 45 23  1 24 62 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an approach that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated.

Let's go through the items and allocate them based on the highest valuation by each agent:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 69
   - Agent 1 values it at 74
   - Agent 2 values it at 66
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 81
   - Agent 1 values it at 14
   - Agent 2 values it at 45
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest valuation)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 34
   - Agent 1 values it at 36
   - Agent 2 values it at 23
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 19
   - Agent 1 values it at 82
   - Agent 2 values it at 1
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 35
   - Agent 1 values it at 86
   - Agent 2 values it at 24
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 55
   - Agent 2 values it at 62
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest valuation)

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 62
   - Agent 1 values it at 25
   - Agent 2 values it at 81
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest valuation)

After this allocation, Agent 0 has received 1 item, Agent 1 has received 4 items, and Agent 2 has received 2 items.

Now, here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```
