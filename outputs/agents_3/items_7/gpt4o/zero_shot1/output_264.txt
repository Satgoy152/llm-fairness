Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  83  67  45  98  95  16
1  40  91  12  61  50  24  79
2  12  55  28  68  45  20  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the individual satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the agents' valuations for each item:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 83
  - Item 2: 67
  - Item 3: 45
  - Item 4: 98
  - Item 5: 95
  - Item 6: 16

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 12
  - Item 3: 61
  - Item 4: 50
  - Item 5: 24
  - Item 6: 79

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Item 0: 12
  - Item 1: 55
  - Item 2: 28
  - Item 3: 68
  - Item 4: 45
  - Item 5: 20
  - Item 6: 94

To achieve a fair allocation, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. One possible allocation strategy is using a greedy approach, where each agent picks their most valued available item iteratively.

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for Item 4 (98).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for Item 1 (91).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for Item 6 (94).

Remove these items from consideration and repeat the process:

4. **Agent 0** now picks Item 5 (95).
5. **Agent 1** now picks Item 3 (61).
6. **Agent 2** now picks Item 2 (28).

Finally, allocate the remaining item:

7. **Agent 0** picks Item 0 (7).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```
