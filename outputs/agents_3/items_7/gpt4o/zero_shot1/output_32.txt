Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  76  64  93  61  93  90
1  11  36  32  17  50  14  14
2  22  15  49  85  13   6  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. 

Let's consider a simple allocation approach by maximizing the sum of valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: 3 (93), 5 (93), 6 (90)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuations: 4 (50), 1 (36), 2 (32)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuations: 3 (85), 2 (49), 6 (52)

Using this information, we can try to allocate items so that each agent gets items they value highly, ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's allocate based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 3, 5, and 6. Let's initially assign items 3 and 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly, so we can assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 6, but since Agent 0 already has item 6 as a high value, we will assign item 2 to Agent 2 instead.
- Agent 1 also values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 can then take item 0.
- For the remaining item, item 6, we can allocate it to Agent 0 to maximize the total allocation value.

After these considerations, the allocation could be:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 7.
