Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20   1  67  34  26  97   1
1  72  99  13   5  25  16   3
2  67  86  94  91   4   5  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[20  1 67 34 26 97  1]
 [72 99 13  5 25 16  3]
 [67 86 94 91  4  5 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (97), so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (99), so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (94), so allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 0 values item 2 second highest (67), but since item 2 is already allocated, the next highest for agent 0 is item 0 (20), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
5. Agent 1 values item 0 second highest (72), but since item 0 is already allocated, the next highest for agent 1 is item 4 (25), so allocate item 4 to agent 1.
6. Agent 2 values item 3 second highest (91), so allocate item 3 to agent 2.
7. The remaining item is item 6. Agent 0 values item 6 at 1, agent 1 values item 6 at 3, and agent 2 values item 6 at 31. The highest valuation is from agent 2, so allocate item 6 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that we are fairly distributing the items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
