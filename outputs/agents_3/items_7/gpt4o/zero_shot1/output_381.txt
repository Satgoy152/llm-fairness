Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  40  52  72  97  76   4
1  89  48  58  37  63  96  90
2  35  46  83  85  94  19  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 46 83 85 94 19 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents by considering their valuations of the items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we assign items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 4 (97) and 3 (72).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 5 (96) and 0 (89).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 4 (94) and 3 (85), but item 4 is already allocated.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, allocate the remaining items to the agents with the highest valuations for those items:

4. **Remaining Items**: 0, 1, 2, 6

   - Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (89), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (46), allocate to Agent 2.
   - Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (83), allocate to Agent 2.
   - Item 6: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (90), allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5, 0, 6],
    "2": [3, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and attempts to maximize the overall valuation for the items allocated to each agent.
