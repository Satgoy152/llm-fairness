Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  67  36  30  37  34   7
1  48  38  38  66  98  87  50
2   7  48  46  31  99  28  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider a strategy that ensures each agent receives items based on their preferences and the total value of the items they receive. Since there are three agents and seven items, each agent should ideally receive at least two items, with one agent receiving three items.

A common approach is to use a method such as maximizing the sum of utilities for each agent, where each agent should try to get the items they value the most. We can use a greedy allocation method where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and then adjust to ensure each agent receives a fair number of items.

Let's proceed with this method:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 48 (highest)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 67 (highest)
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 46 (highest)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 66 (highest)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 99 (highest)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 87 (highest)
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 53 (highest)

This initial allocation leads to:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0, 3, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 4, 6]

However, this allocation doesn't ensure each agent gets at least two items because Agent 0 only has one item. We need to adjust this allocation:

Let's try to distribute the items more evenly:

1. Move item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 1, and item 0 from Agent 1 to Agent 0:

   - Agent 0: [0, 1]
   - Agent 1: [3, 5]
   - Agent 2: [2, 4, 6]

Now, each agent has at least two items, and the distribution is more balanced. Therefore, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
