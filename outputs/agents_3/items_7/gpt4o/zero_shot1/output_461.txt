Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  11  74  50  53  92  70
1  52  42  88  10  56  78   4
2  90  26  83  24  57  56  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90 26 83 24 57 56 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We will consider the valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

1. **Assigning items:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 5, and 6.
   - Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2 and moderate valuations for items 0 and 5.
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 6, and moderate valuations for items 2 and 5.

2. **Initial assignments based on highest valuations:**
   - Item 0: Assign to Agent 2 (value 90) over Agent 1 (value 52) and Agent 0 (value 16).
   - Item 1: Assign to Agent 0 (value 11) over Agent 1 (value 42) and Agent 2 (value 26).
   - Item 2: Assign to Agent 0 (value 74) over Agent 1 (value 88) and Agent 2 (value 83).
   - Item 3: Assign to Agent 0 (value 50) over Agent 1 (value 10) and Agent 2 (value 24).
   - Item 4: Assign to Agent 1 (value 56) over Agent 0 (value 53) and Agent 2 (value 57).
   - Item 5: Assign to Agent 0 (value 92) over Agent 1 (value 78) and Agent 2 (value 56).
   - Item 6: Assign to Agent 2 (value 96) over Agent 0 (value 70) and Agent 1 (value 4).

3. **Final allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3, 5
   - Agent 1: Item 4
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 6

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 6]
}
```
