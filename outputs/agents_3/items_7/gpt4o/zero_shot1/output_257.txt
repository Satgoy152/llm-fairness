Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  71   5  32  54   2  29
1  80  89  24  31  14  83   7
2  60   4   2  49  44  97  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6 71  5 32 54  2 29]
 [80 89 24 31 14 83  7]
 [60  4  2 49 44 97 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 1 (71) and 4 (54).
- Agent 1 has high values for items 0 (80), 1 (89), and 5 (83).
- Agent 2 has high values for items 5 (97) and 6 (58).

Based on these observations, we can try to allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. Allocate item 1 to agent 1 since it has the highest value from any agent (89).
2. Allocate item 0 to agent 1 since it's the second highest value (80).
3. Allocate item 5 to agent 2 since it's the highest value for agent 2 (97).
4. Allocate item 6 to agent 2 since it's the second highest value for agent 2 (58).
5. Allocate item 4 to agent 0 since it's the highest remaining value for agent 0 (54).
6. Allocate item 3 to agent 2 since it maximizes the remaining value for agent 2 (49).
7. Allocate item 2 to agent 0 as it is the only remaining item (5).

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, with all 7 items distributed.
