Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  69  59  66   0  73  38
1  11  87   3  28  26  33  41
2  26  19   1  66  55  55  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items based on their valuations that maximize their perceived value. The goal is to distribute the items such that the allocation is perceived as fair by each agent. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuations for items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5. However, agent 1 has a higher valuation for item 1, and agent 2 has a higher valuation for item 5. Therefore, agent 0 should get items 0, 2, and 3.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for items 1 and 4. They should receive these items.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for items 5 and 6. They should receive these items.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are valuable to them, and all 7 items are distributed.
