Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78   5  65  39  59  57  56
1  20   0  61  87  91   6  55
2  69  92  71  71  17  79  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Preferences:** First, identify which items each agent values the most.

2. **Initial Allocation:** Allocate the highest-valued items to each agent, trying to ensure a fair distribution.

3. **Adjust Allocation:** Adjust allocations to ensure that all items are distributed and each agent receives a reasonable value.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- **Agent 0** values items as follows: [78, 5, 65, 39, 59, 57, 56]
- **Agent 1** values items as follows: [20, 0, 61, 87, 91, 6, 55]
- **Agent 2** values items as follows: [69, 92, 71, 71, 17, 79, 51]

**Proposed Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0:** The highest values for Agent 0 are for items 0 and 2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** The highest values for Agent 1 are for items 3 and 4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** The highest values for Agent 2 are for items 1 and 5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

After this initial allocation, we have:
- Agent 0 has item 0
- Agent 1 has item 3
- Agent 2 has item 1

Now, allocate the remaining items:

4. **Remaining Items:** Items 2, 4, 5, and 6 are left.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 as it’s their next highest value.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 as it’s their next highest value.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 as it’s their next highest value.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 as it’s their next highest value.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
