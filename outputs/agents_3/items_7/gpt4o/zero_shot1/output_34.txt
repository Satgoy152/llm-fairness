Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  69  97  78   8  46  23
1   0  43  62  32  54  43  23
2  18  84  52  41  53  74  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[75 69 97 78  8 46 23]
 [ 0 43 62 32 54 43 23]
 [18 84 52 41 53 74 43]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy where we try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations accordingly.

Here's how the valuations look:

```
Agent 0: [75, 69, 97, 78, 8, 46, 23]
Agent 1: [0, 43, 62, 32, 54, 43, 23]
Agent 2: [18, 84, 52, 41, 53, 74, 43]
```

To achieve a fair distribution, we can consider giving each agent the items they value the most while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 2 (97) – Highest valued item for Agent 0.
   - Item 0 (75) – Second highest for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 4 (54) – Highest valued item for Agent 1.
   - Item 1 (43) – Second highest (tied, but choosing based on allocation balance).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 5 (74) – Highest valued item for Agent 2.
   - Item 6 (43) – Second highest after allocation.
   - Item 3 (41) – Next highest available for Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly while distributing all items fairly. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
