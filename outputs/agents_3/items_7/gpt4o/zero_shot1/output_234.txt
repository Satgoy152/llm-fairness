Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  35  48  57  39  49  82
1  76  49  34  12  71  60  67
2  38  46  11  23  13  80  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [38 46 11 23 13 80 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent. Since there are 3 agents and 7 items, not all agents will get the same number of items, but we can try to balance the allocation as much as possible.

Let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the item with the highest value to each agent, then continue assigning the next highest valued items to the agents who have received fewer items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values items 6, 3, and 2 the most. Assign items 6 and 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values items 0, 4, and 5 the most. Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values items 5, 1, and 0 the most. Assign items 5 and 1 to Agent 2.

This leaves item 2 unassigned. The next highest value for item 2 is by Agent 0, who currently has 2 items, while Agents 1 and 2 also have 2 items each.

Let's adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets an item:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values item 2 more than the others do.

Now, we will check and finalize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 3, 2
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4
- Agent 2: Items 5, 1

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and each agent gets at least two items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
