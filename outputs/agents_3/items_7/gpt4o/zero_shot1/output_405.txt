Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  61  48  84  82  90  16
1  17  40  97  44  28   3  20
2  77  83  14  96  55  62  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the following strategy: allocate items to agents in such a way that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. A common method to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm where we pick the highest value item for each agent in turn and continue until all items are distributed.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by sorting the items for each agent based on their valuations in descending order.

2. Allocate items to agents by assigning each agent their highest-valued available item that has not been allocated yet.

Let's walk through this:

**Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Items sorted by value: 5 (90), 3 (84), 4 (82), 1 (61), 0 (48), 2 (48), 6 (16)

**Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Items sorted by value: 2 (97), 3 (44), 1 (40), 4 (28), 6 (20), 0 (17), 5 (3)

**Agent 2's Valuations:**
   - Items sorted by value: 3 (96), 1 (83), 0 (77), 6 (88), 5 (62), 4 (55), 2 (14)

Now, allocate one item to each agent in the first round based on their highest preference:

- Agent 0 gets item 5 (90)
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (97)
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (96)

Remove these items from the list of available items and repeat the process:

**Remaining Items:**
   - 0, 1, 4, 6

**Agent 0's New Valuations:**
   - Items sorted by value: 4 (82), 1 (61), 0 (48), 6 (16)

**Agent 1's New Valuations:**
   - Items sorted by value: 3 (44), 1 (40), 4 (28), 6 (20), 0 (17)

**Agent 2's New Valuations:**
   - Items sorted by value: 1 (83), 0 (77), 6 (88), 5 (62), 4 (55)

Allocate items again:

- Agent 0 gets item 4 (82)
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (40)
- Agent 2 gets item 6 (88)

Only one item left:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (48)

Now, we have allocated all 7 items:

- Agent 0 has items: 5, 4, 0
- Agent 1 has items: 2, 1
- Agent 2 has items: 3, 6

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```
