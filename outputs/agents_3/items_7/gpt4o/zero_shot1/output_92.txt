Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  42  29   4   5  43  69
1   9  99  71  11  82  39  81
2  75  16  11   7  96  24  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 42 29  4  5 43 69]
 [ 9 99 71 11 82 39 81]
 [75 16 11  7 96 24 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value for Agent 0 is item 6 (value 69).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value for Agent 1 is item 1 (value 99).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value for Agent 2 is item 4 (value 96).

Now, we allocate the remaining items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0 (value 53), as it's their next highest value.
   - Item 5 (value 43), as it's their next highest value.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 2 (value 71), as it's their next highest value.
   - Item 3 (value 11), as it's their next highest value.

Now, all 7 items are allocated, and each agent has received at least one item. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
