Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  25  11  80  57  68  75
1  25  13  92  10  65  82  22
2  76  14  35  23  33  54  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

We can start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, then proceed to allocate the remaining items in a manner that keeps the distribution balanced.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (80).
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (92).
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (76).

Now that each agent has one item, we have 4 remaining items to allocate. We will consider remaining high-value items for each agent:

4. Agent 1 values item 5 second highest (82).
5. Agent 2 values item 6 second highest (80).
6. Agent 0 values item 6 third highest (75), but it's already taken by Agent 2. Instead, Agent 0 can pick item 5, but it's taken by Agent 1. Next, Agent 0 can pick item 4 (57).
7. Agent 0 values item 5 next highest, but it's taken. Next, Agent 0 can pick item 6, but it's taken. Next, Agent 0 can pick item 0 (49).

After these allocations, Agent 0 will have 3 items (3, 4, 0), Agent 1 will have 2 items (2, 5), and Agent 2 will have 2 items (6, 1). 

Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents with each agent receiving a fair number of items according to their preferences.
