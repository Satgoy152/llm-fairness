Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  72  15  54  36  65  70
1   9  94   6  12  45  27  37
2  13  59  70  31  74  87  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[23 72 15 54 36 65 70]
 [ 9 94  6 12 45 27 37]
 [13 59 70 31 74 87 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  72  15  54  36  65  70
1   9  94   6  12  45  27  37
2  13  59  70  31  74  87  64
```

We can try to allocate the items by considering the highest value an agent has for each item and ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Allocate items to maximize their total value.
2. Agent 1: Allocate items to maximize their total value, considering what has already been allocated.
3. Agent 2: Allocate items to maximize their total value, considering what has already been allocated.

Let's assign the items:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 6
  - Item 1: Value = 72
  - Item 6: Value = 70

- Agent 1: Items 4, 0
  - Item 4: Value = 45
  - Item 0: Value = 9

- Agent 2: Items 2, 3, 5
  - Item 2: Value = 70
  - Item 3: Value = 31
  - Item 5: Value = 87

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
