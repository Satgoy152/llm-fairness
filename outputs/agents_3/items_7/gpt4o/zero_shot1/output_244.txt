Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  77   1  31  27  30  81
1  46  61  76  71  84  19   1
2  31  34  70   8  92  81  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their total valuations, we should aim to assign items to agents such that the total value each agent receives is as high as possible. We will examine each agent's preferences and allocate items accordingly.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values are for items 1 (77) and 6 (81).
   - Assign items 1 and 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values are for items 4 (84) and 2 (76).
   - Assign items 4 and 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values are for items 4 (92), 6 (85), and 5 (81). Since item 4 is already assigned, consider next highest values.
   - Assign items 3 and 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining item**: 
   - Item 0 is left unassigned. It has the highest value for Agent 1 (46).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share considering their valuations, and all items are allocated.
