Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  74  52  37  70  51  12
1   5  47  52   9  30  69  35
2  43   5  92  76  35  19  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while ensuring that each agent gets approximately the same number of items, given there are 3 agents and 7 items. One common approach is to employ a "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" where each agent picks their most valued item in turns.

Here's a proposed allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** selects item 0 (value 96).
2. **Agent 1** selects item 5 (value 69).
3. **Agent 2** selects item 2 (value 92).
4. **Agent 0** selects item 1 (value 74).
5. **Agent 1** selects item 6 (value 35).
6. **Agent 2** selects item 3 (value 76).
7. **Agent 0** selects item 4 (value 70).

This allocation was determined by having each agent select their next most valued item that hasn't been allocated yet. Let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
