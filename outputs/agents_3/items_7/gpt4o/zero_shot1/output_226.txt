Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  82  64  31  15  96  98
1  34  19  71  18  78  53  70
2  72  86  94  65  30  60  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 86 94 65 30 60 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item since there are 7 items and 3 agents. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest value for item 6.
   - Agent 1 has the highest value for item 4.
   - Agent 2 has the highest value for item 2.

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuations**:
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items to Balance Overall Value**:
   - Agent 0 could benefit from item 5 (96).
   - Agent 1 could benefit from item 3 (18).
   - Agent 2 could benefit from item 0 (72).

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 to balance the remaining items.

Given these considerations, hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, with the distribution of items aiming to balance the total perceived value among the agents based on their preferences.
