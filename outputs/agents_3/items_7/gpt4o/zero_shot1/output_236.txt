Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  45  42  98  19  10  69
1  20  81  71  52  19  92  56
2  71  14  60  53  42  61  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent derives from their allocated items while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Determine the highest valuation for each item:** Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Check allocation fairness:** Ensure that each agent receives a fair number of items, considering there are a total of 7 items to allocate among 3 agents.

3. **Adjust allocations if necessary:** If one agent receives an excessive number of items compared to others, reallocate items to balance the distribution.

### Allocation:

Let's analyze the valuation for each item:

- **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 at 20, and Agent 2 at 71. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 at 81, and Agent 2 at 14. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 at 71, and Agent 2 at 60. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 at 52, and Agent 2 at 53. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 at 19, and Agent 2 at 42. Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it at 10, Agent 1 at 92, and Agent 2 at 61. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 6:** Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 at 56, and Agent 2 at 97. Assign to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

After balancing the allocations so that all agents receive an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we have:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 3
- **Agent 1:** Items 1, 2, 5
- **Agent 2:** Items 4, 6

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
