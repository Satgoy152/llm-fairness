Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  78  73  54   2  75   9
1  91  85  82  63  14  33  65
2  43  72  60  86   1  49  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [43 72 60 86  1 49 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing their total valuation. This means each item should be assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 91.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 85.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 82.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 86.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 2 (although it's low, Agent 0 values it more than others).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 75.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 65.

Allocating the items based on these valuations, we get the following distribution:

- Agent 0 receives Item 4 and Item 5.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0, Item 1, Item 2, and Item 6.
- Agent 2 receives Item 3.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "2": [3]
}
```
