Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  46  47  16  94  63  19
1  85  88  42  55   0  69  11
2  24  52   4  96  77  17  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [24 52  4 96 77 17 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's examine the table to determine the optimal allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 0 (94).
   - The next highest values are items 2 (47), 1 (46), and 0 (45).
   - Let's assign item 4 to Agent 0 first.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items 1 (88) and 0 (85) have the highest values for Agent 1.
   - Let's assign item 1 to Agent 1 first.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 2 (96).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 first.

Now, each agent has one item. We continue to allocate the remaining items as follows:

4. **Agent 0:**
   - Remaining items for consideration are 0, 2, 5, 6.
   - Highest value for these items is item 2 (47).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1:**
   - Remaining items for consideration are 0, 5, 6.
   - Highest value for these items is item 0 (85).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 2:**
   - Remaining items for consideration are 5, 6.
   - Highest value for these items is item 6 (37).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

7. **Re-evaluate:**
   - Remaining item is 5.
   - Agent 0 values item 5 at 63, Agent 1 at 69, and Agent 2 at 17.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 for the highest value (69).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents with a focus on maximizing their individual values.
