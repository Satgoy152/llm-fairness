Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62   5  44  27  54  47   1
1  31  94  94  53  16  84  70
2  62  78   3  60  92  75  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 94 94 53 16 84 70]
 [62 78  3 60 92 75 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, given that there are 7 items and 3 agents. We'll consider how to distribute items based on the values each agent assigns to them.

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 0 (Value: 62)
   - Item 2 (Value: 44)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1 (Value: 94)
   - Item 4 (Value: 16)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 3 (Value: 60)
   - Item 5 (Value: 75)
   - Item 6 (Value: 54)

Let's verify that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 2] with a total value of 62 + 44 = 106.
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 4] with a total value of 94 + 16 = 110.
- Agent 2 receives items [3, 5, 6] with a total value of 60 + 75 + 54 = 189.

All 7 items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
