Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  16  98  67   5  95  76
1  26   6  81  85  44  81  85
2  74  84  17  32  98  85  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction or utility for all agents. One common approach is to use a method that attempts to distribute items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible given their valuations.

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 5, and 6.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3 and 6.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4, 0, and 1.

Let's allocate items based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 98 for Agent 0, which is the highest for this item).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 95 for Agent 0, which is the highest for this item).
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 85 for Agent 1, which is the highest for this item).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 85 for Agent 1, which is the highest for this item).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 98 for Agent 2, which is the highest for this item).
6. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 74 for Agent 2, which is the highest for this item).
7. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 84 for Agent 2, which is the highest for this item).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items according to their valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [4, 0, 1]
}
```
