Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  56  73  81   1  93   1
1  44  37  99  90  96  16  65
2  44  31  53  95  70  37   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[40 56 73 81  1 93  1]
 [44 37 99 90 96 16 65]
 [44 31 53 95 70 37  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a simple approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's evaluate each item:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 40
  - Agent 1 values it at 44
  - Agent 2 values it at 44

  Both Agent 1 and Agent 2 value it equally. We'll assign it to Agent 1.

- **Item 1**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 56
  - Agent 1 values it at 37
  - Agent 2 values it at 31

  Agent 0 values it the most. We'll assign it to Agent 0.

- **Item 2**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 73
  - Agent 1 values it at 99
  - Agent 2 values it at 53

  Agent 1 values it the most. We'll assign it to Agent 1.

- **Item 3**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 81
  - Agent 1 values it at 90
  - Agent 2 values it at 95

  Agent 2 values it the most. We'll assign it to Agent 2.

- **Item 4**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 1
  - Agent 1 values it at 96
  - Agent 2 values it at 70

  Agent 1 values it the most. We'll assign it to Agent 1.

- **Item 5**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 93
  - Agent 1 values it at 16
  - Agent 2 values it at 37

  Agent 0 values it the most. We'll assign it to Agent 0.

- **Item 6**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 1
  - Agent 1 values it at 65
  - Agent 2 values it at 9

  Agent 1 values it the most. We'll assign it to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "2": [3]
}
```
