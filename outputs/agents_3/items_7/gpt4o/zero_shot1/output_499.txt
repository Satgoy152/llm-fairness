Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81   4  70  33  40  30   7
1  10  44  29  13  14  87  88
2  35   8  91  22  36  13  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while also trying to balance the number of items distributed.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 0 (81) and item 2 (70), so allocating these two items to agent 0 could maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values items 5 (87) and 6 (88), so assigning these two items to agent 1 would maximize their satisfaction.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 2 highly (91), but since it's already allocated to agent 0, we can allocate item 3 (22) and item 4 (36) to agent 2.

This allocation gives agent 0 two items, agent 1 two items, and agent 2 two items, leaving one item unallocated. We can give agent 0 one additional item, item 1 (4), which agent 0 values more than the other agents.

Now, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: items 0, 1, and 2
- Agent 1: items 5 and 6
- Agent 2: items 3 and 4

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent has an integer number of items. Here is the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
