Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  59  21   4  56  27  83
1  51  35   7  37  29  30  45
2  13  50  92  35  96   6  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[57 59 21  4 56 27 83]
 [51 35  7 37 29 30 45]
 [13 50 92 35 96  6 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Let's analyze the valuation table to determine the optimal allocation.

Valuation table:
```
Agent 0: [57, 59, 21, 4, 56, 27, 83]
Agent 1: [51, 35, 7, 37, 29, 30, 45]
Agent 2: [13, 50, 92, 35, 96, 6, 71]
```

Let's allocate items by considering the highest valuations first while ensuring all items are allocated:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 with a value of 96.
2. **Agent 2** also values item 2 highly with a value of 92.
3. **Agent 0** values item 6 highly with a value of 83.
4. **Agent 0** also values item 1 highly with a value of 59.
5. **Agent 1** values item 0 highly with a value of 51.
6. **Agent 1** values item 3 with a value of 37.
7. **Agent 0** values item 5 with a value of 27.

Now, let's check whether all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent ends up with an integer number of items.
