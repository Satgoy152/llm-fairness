Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  51  33  57  78  45  70
1  49  68  77  65  40  97  72
2  39  33  16  98  40  98  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent's preferences are considered. One approach is to aim for a balanced allocation where each agent receives items that, collectively, maximize their value while also ensuring all items are allocated.

Given the agents' valuations, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their overall preferences.
2. Try to allocate items to maximize the total satisfaction for all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: Total value = 47 + 51 + 33 + 57 + 78 + 45 + 70 = 381
- Agent 1: Total value = 49 + 68 + 77 + 65 + 40 + 97 + 72 = 468
- Agent 2: Total value = 39 + 33 + 16 + 98 + 40 + 98 + 97 = 421

Now, we can attempt to allocate items based on maximizing value for each agent:

1. Allocate items to Agent 2, who highly values items 3, 5, and 6:
   - Allocate item 3 (value 98), item 5 (value 98), and item 6 (value 97) to Agent 2.

2. Allocate the remaining items to Agent 1 and Agent 0:
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (value 77) and item 5 (value 97) was already allocated to Agent 2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 1 (value 68) and item 0 (value 49) to Agent 1 to maximize their satisfaction.

3. Allocate the remaining items to Agent 0:
   - Allocate item 4 (value 78) to Agent 0, as itâ€™s the highest value for them.

Let's see the allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 4]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [3, 5, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
