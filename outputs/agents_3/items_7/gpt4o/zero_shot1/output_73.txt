Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  38  90  57  13   2  47
1  71  56  42  84  13  90  14
2  23  51  62  97   1  87  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for each item and try to distribute the items so that the overall satisfaction (in terms of value) is balanced among the agents. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm that allocates items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most (71), so allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most (56), so allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (90), so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most (97), so allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 and Agent 1 value it equally (13), but Agent 1 already has 2 items, so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most (90), so allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most (89), so allocate to Agent 2.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 6]

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and tries to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```
