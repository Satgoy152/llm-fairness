Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  93  42  33  72  64   1
1  81   9  35  35   6  97  41
2  91  96   8  23  83  53  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent gets from the items they are assigned. One common method is to use a greedy algorithm to assign each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with a total number of items as evenly distributed as possible.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [55, 93, 42, 33, 72, 64, 1]
- Agent 1: [81, 9, 35, 35, 6, 97, 41]
- Agent 2: [91, 96, 8, 23, 83, 53, 71]

We'll allocate each item by assigning it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most with 91.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most with 96.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most with 42.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most with 33.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most with 83.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most with 97.
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most with 71.

However, we need to ensure that items are distributed fairly among the three agents. Let's adjust the allocation to make sure each agent gets a fair share (in terms of number of items):

- Items assigned to Agent 0: [2, 3]
- Items assigned to Agent 1: [5]
- Items assigned to Agent 2: [0, 1, 4, 6]

This gives Agent 0 two items, Agent 1 one item, and Agent 2 four items. Now we need to balance it better:

Let's try redistributing:

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value, already there)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value, already there)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value, already there)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value, already there)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (Agent 2 values it most, but let's give to Agent 1 for balance)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value)

Now, each agent has 2 or 3 items:

- Agent 0: [2, 3]
- Agent 1: [5, 6]
- Agent 2: [0, 1, 4]

This distribution is fairer:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
