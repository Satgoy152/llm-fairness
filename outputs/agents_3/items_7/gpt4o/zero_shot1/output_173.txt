Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  72   1  73  43   0  41
1  85   9  11  66  48  25  73
2  43  65  99  14  71  69  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [43 65 99 14 71 69 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value for each agent while trying to distribute the items in a balanced manner. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent can get from all items.
2. Assign the items to the agents based on maximizing overall satisfaction.

Let's evaluate and allocate:

### Agent Valuations

- **Agent 0**: [84, 72, 1, 73, 43, 0, 41]
- **Agent 1**: [85, 9, 11, 66, 48, 25, 73]
- **Agent 2**: [43, 65, 99, 14, 71, 69, 61]

### Allocation Strategy

- **Agent 0** highly values item 0 and item 3.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 0 and item 6.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 2 and item 5.

Given these valuations, a fair allocation can be:

- Assign items with the highest valuations first, ensuring each agent gets a reasonable distribution of items.

### Allocation

- Agent 0: Item 0 (value 84), Item 3 (value 73)
- Agent 1: Item 6 (value 73), Item 4 (value 48)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (value 99), Item 5 (value 69), Item 1 (value 65)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items according to their highest valuations while distributing them fairly.

### JSON Format Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 1]
}
```
