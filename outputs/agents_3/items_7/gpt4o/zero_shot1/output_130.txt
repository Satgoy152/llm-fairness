Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  12  77  76  96  13  52
1  29  28  75  70  79  49  84
2  57  27  31  90  70  26  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 27 31 90 70 26 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 3 agents, we want to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one approach to consider:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to the items.
2. Assign items to agents by maximizing each agent's total valuation.

Let's calculate the total value if each item is assigned to each agent:

- Agent 0:
  - Total Value: 61 + 12 + 77 + 76 + 96 + 13 + 52 = 387

- Agent 1:
  - Total Value: 29 + 28 + 75 + 70 + 79 + 49 + 84 = 414

- Agent 2:
  - Total Value: 57 + 27 + 31 + 90 + 70 + 26 + 90 = 391

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed:

- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (value = 96)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (value = 84)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (value = 90)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (value = 77)
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (value = 49)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (value = 57)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (value = 27)

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 2
- Agent 1: Items 6, 5
- Agent 2: Items 3, 0, 1

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [3, 0, 1]
}
```
