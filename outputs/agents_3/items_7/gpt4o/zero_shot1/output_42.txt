Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  64  27  21  45  67  46
1  48  95  36  48  49  67  74
2  47  61   8  75  58  31  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations for the items. To do this, we can look at the preferences for each item and try to allocate them in a way that maximizes the total valuation for all agents.

Let's evaluate the items one by one and assign them to the agent who values them the most:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 71
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Agent 2 values it at 47
   - Assign to Agent 0

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 64
   - Agent 1 values it at 95
   - Agent 2 values it at 61
   - Assign to Agent 1

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 27
   - Agent 1 values it at 36
   - Agent 2 values it at 8
   - Assign to Agent 1

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 21
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Agent 2 values it at 75
   - Assign to Agent 2

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 45
   - Agent 1 values it at 49
   - Agent 2 values it at 58
   - Assign to Agent 2

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 67
   - Agent 1 values it at 67
   - Agent 2 values it at 31
   - Assign to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 and Agent 1 have equal valuation, but Agent 0 has fewer items so far)

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 46
   - Agent 1 values it at 74
   - Agent 2 values it at 52
   - Assign to Agent 1

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
