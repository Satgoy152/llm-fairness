Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  20  69  54  93  58  50
1  50  34  78  97  81  58  85
2  59  83  70  31  97  73  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a method that aims to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is balanced as much as possible. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items: Item 4 (93), Item 2 (69)
   - Total valuation: 162

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items: Item 3 (97), Item 6 (85)
   - Total valuation: 182

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued items: Item 1 (83), Item 5 (73), Item 0 (59)
   - Total valuation: 215

The allocation ensures each agent gets at least two items, and the total valuation is fairly balanced as much as possible given the constraints. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
