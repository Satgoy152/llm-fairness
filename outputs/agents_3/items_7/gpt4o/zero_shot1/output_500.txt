Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  95  71  18  86  39  70
1  34  99  35  11  17  91  80
2  22  37  97  27  67  81  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. One approach is to maximize the total value received by each agent given the constraints. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Assign the highest value items first**: Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most.
2. **Balance the allocations**: Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while considering their preferences.

Let's analyze the table for the highest valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (95).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (99) but it's already allocated to Agent 0, so we consider the next highest, item 5 (91).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (97).

Based on this, let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Next, allocate the remaining items with consideration to the next highest values and balance:

- Agent 0 can also take item 4 (86).
- Agent 1 can take item 6 (80).
- Agent 2 can take item 3 (27).
- The remaining item 0 (23) can be allocated to Agent 0.

Now, each agent gets a reasonable share considering their valuations, and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 0],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring fairness.
