Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  66  13  68  62  76   7
1  78  14  13  22   0  98  29
2  78  34  37  84  54  64  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute the items in a way that balances the overall value each agent receives.

Here are the steps to achieve a fairly balanced allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: Item 5 (76), Item 3 (68)
   - Allocate items: [5, 3]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: Item 5 (98), Item 0 (78)
   - Allocate items: [0]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: Item 3 (84), Item 0 (78)
   - Allocate items: [1, 2, 4, 6]

Now, checking if all items from 0 to 6 are allocated:

- **Agent 0** has items [5, 3]
- **Agent 1** has item [0]
- **Agent 2** has items [1, 2, 4, 6]

Reassign if necessary to ensure each agent has at least one item and the total allocation matches the number of items available:

- Rebalance considering the constraints and agent preferences to ensure fairness.

After reviewing the allocations, the final allocation can be adjusted further for balance:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent gets a fair share, and the total number of allocated items is 7.
