Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  10  70  86  18  31  66
1  79  84  45  71   6  16  71
2  91  67  35  51  25   7  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to use a "round-robin" style allocation, where items are distributed one by one to the agent who values them the most and hasn't yet received an allocation for that item.

Let's proceed with this method:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 86
   - Agent 1 values it at 79
   - Agent 2 values it at 91 (highest)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 10
   - Agent 1 values it at 84 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 67
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 70 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 45
   - Agent 2 values it at 35
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 86 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 71
   - Agent 2 values it at 51
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 18
   - Agent 1 values it at 6
   - Agent 2 values it at 25 (highest)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 31 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 16
   - Agent 2 values it at 7
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 66
   - Agent 1 values it at 71 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 42
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their individual valuations, maximizing overall satisfaction given the constraints.
