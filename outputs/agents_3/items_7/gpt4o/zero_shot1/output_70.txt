Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74   5  17  71  74  76  48
1  74  96  68  15  99  76  60
2  88   4  72  91  30  83  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88  4 72 91 30 83 24]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to ensure each agent gets the items they value the most while aiming for a balance in the total number of items each agent receives. Given there are 7 items and 3 agents, a fair allocation would generally aim for each agent to get 2 or 3 items.

Here's a potential approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values items 0 and 4 highly (74), and also values item 5 (76).
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values item 4 most highly (99), followed by item 1 (96).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values item 3 (91) most highly, and also values item 5 (83) and item 0 (88).

Let's try to give each agent the items they value the most while ensuring that all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0 (74), Item 5 (76)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 1 (96), Item 4 (99)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 3 (91), Item 2 (72), Item 6 (24)

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair number of items and tries to satisfy each agent's preferences as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 2, 6]
}
```
