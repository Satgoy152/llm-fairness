Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  50  67  34  29  80  34
1  77  84   9  56  14  80  21
2  41  10  72  23  94   6  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 10 72 23 94  6 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. We'll try to distribute the items so that the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) is maximized for each agent.

Here's one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** We'll assign items based on the highest value agent 0 places on them. Agent 0 values item 5 at 80, which is their highest valuation, so assign item 5 to agent 0. We'll also assign item 2, which agent 0 values at 67, the second highest for them.

2. **Agent 1:** Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 1 at 84, so assign item 1 to agent 1. Next, agent 1 values item 0 at 77, which is their second highest. Assign item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 4 at 94, so assign item 4 to agent 2. The next highest valuation for agent 2 is item 2 at 72, but item 2 has already been allocated to agent 0. The next highest available item for agent 2 is item 3 at 23, so assign item 3 to agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. The remaining item is item 6. We need to decide who values item 6 the most. Agent 0 values it at 34, agent 1 values it at 21, and agent 2 values it at 17. Therefore, assign item 6 to agent 0.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their respective valuations.
