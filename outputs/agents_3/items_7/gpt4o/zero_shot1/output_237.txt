Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  59  31   9  81  92  65
1  47  41  78  94  90  40  50
2  43  93  91   6  45  22  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent's total valuation is reasonably balanced. However, since exact equality may not always be possible, we will try to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values the highest for item 5 (92) and has relatively high value for item 0 (79).
- Agent 1 values the highest for item 3 (94) and item 4 (90).
- Agent 2 values the highest for item 1 (93) and item 2 (91).

Based on this analysis, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: items 0, 5
- Agent 1: items 3, 4
- Agent 2: items 1, 2, 6

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share of their high-value items, balancing the overall allocation.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2, 6]
}
```
