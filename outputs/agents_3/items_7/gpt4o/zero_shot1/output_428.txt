Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  33  60  12  73  70  85
1  68  21  35  13  53  68  53
2  56  29  16  21  14  99  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[50 33 60 12 73 70 85]
 [68 21 35 13 53 68 53]
 [56 29 16 21 14 99 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

```
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agent 0  50  33  60  12  73  70  85
Agent 1  68  21  35  13  53  68  53
Agent 2  56  29  16  21  14  99  40
```

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 6, 5, and 4. Let's prioritize these items for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most and item 5 next most.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 5 but Agent 0 values it more. Agent 2 values item 1 the most among the remaining items.

Let's allocate based on maximizing each agent's total value:

- **Agent 0**: Items [6, 4] (valuations 85, 73)
- **Agent 1**: Items [0] (valuation 68)
- **Agent 2**: Items [5, 1] (valuations 99, 29)

Now let's check the remaining items:
- Items 2, 3 are left.

Allocate remaining items:
- **Agent 0** can take item 2 (valuation 60)
- **Agent 1** will take item 3 (valuation 13)

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items to maximize each agent's value given their preferences. Each agent receives items fairly based on their highest valuations.
