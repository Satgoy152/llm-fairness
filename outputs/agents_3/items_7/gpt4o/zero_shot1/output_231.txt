Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  57  90  40  37  15  65
1  82  30  12  65   3  57   8
2  26  54   1  40  99  33  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 30 12 65  3 57  8]
 [26 54  1 40 99 33 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's total value from the items they receive. One way to approach this is to iterate through the items and allocate them to the agent who values them the most:

1. Item 0 is most valued by agent 1 with a value of 82.
2. Item 1 is most valued by agent 0 with a value of 57.
3. Item 2 is most valued by agent 0 with a value of 90.
4. Item 3 is most valued by agent 1 with a value of 65.
5. Item 4 is most valued by agent 2 with a value of 99.
6. Item 5 is most valued by agent 1 with a value of 57.
7. Item 6 is most valued by agent 0 with a value of 65.

Let's check if each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. If not, we may need to adjust to ensure a fair distribution of items.

Now, let's distribute the items while ensuring fairness:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 5
- Agent 2: Item 4

Each agent gets at least 1 item, and we distribute all 7 items. This distribution considers both maximizing each agent's value and ensuring a fair and balanced allocation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [4]
}
```
