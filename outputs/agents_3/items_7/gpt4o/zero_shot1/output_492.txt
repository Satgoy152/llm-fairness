Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  35  88  41  60  39  21
1  79  39  84   7  75  80  36
2  34  51  22  29  32  89  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** 
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the most at 88.
   - Agent 1 values Item 5 the most at 80.
   - Agent 2 values Item 5 the most at 89.

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations while preventing conflicts:
     - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
     - Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 values it more than Agent 1).
     - Now, assign Item 0 to Agent 0 as it's another high-value item for Agent 0.

3. **Continue Allocation to Maximize Valuation:**
   - Agent 1 also values Item 1 highly at 39, and no other agent values it as much, so assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 2, another high-value item for Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1, another high-value item for Agent 1.
   - Lastly, assign Item 3 to Agent 0 since it has the highest remaining value for Agent 0 after Items 0 and 2.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Each agent should have a fair and maximized value from their allocated items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 5 and 6. 

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent's valuation is reasonably maximized.
