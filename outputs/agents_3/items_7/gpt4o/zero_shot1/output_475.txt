Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  48  55  17  65  99  28
1  56  21  76  92  64  82   8
2  60  25  97  54  54  44  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. Since there are 7 items and 3 agents, an equitable approach would be to ensure that each agent ends up with the highest possible total value, while also attempting to distribute the number of items as evenly as possible.

Let's examine the allocations using a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (99), Item 4 (65), Item 2 (55)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (92), Item 2 (76)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (97), Item 0 (60)

Let's consider these allocations:

- Assign Item 5 and Item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 3 and Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 6 and Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign the remaining Item 2 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 has a high valuation for it and needs another item for a fair distribution.

This way, each agent gets an approximately equitable distribution based on both the number of items and their valuations.

### Allocations in JSON format:

{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 6]
}
