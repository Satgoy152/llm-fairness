Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  30  27  43  55  84  74
1  49   1   3  61   2  55  67
2   5  93  83  33   2  55  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. One common method to achieve this is to use the concept of envy-freeness or maximizing the sum of valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items based on the given valuations:

Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 5, and 6.
Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3 and 6.
Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.

We need to assign 7 items across the 3 agents. Here is one potential allocation that attempts to maximize satisfaction:

- Assign items 0 and 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 3, 4, and 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 2.

This allocation tries to match the highest valuations of each agent with the items they receive. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated.
