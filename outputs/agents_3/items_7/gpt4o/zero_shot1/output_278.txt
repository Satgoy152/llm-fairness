Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  31  69  30  12   9  91
1  24  43  46  76  85  24  33
2  52  97  32   1  51  47  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the valuations of the items by each agent. One approach is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring a relatively balanced distribution.

Let's analyze the valuations first:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 2, and 6.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 4 and relatively high values for items 3 and 2.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 1 and relatively high values for items 0 and 5.

We aim to distribute the items so that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 values item 0 with 52, which is higher than Agent 1's 24.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, where Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 97.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, who has the highest valuation of 69.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, who values it 76.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, who values it the most at 85.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2, who values it 47.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 0, who has the highest valuation at 91.

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```

Each agent receives a number of items reflecting the highest valuations they have for those items.
