Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  85  28  51  99  78  41
1  43  13  44  56  76  14  90
2  78  99  33  40  76  63  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[34 85 28 51 99 78 41]
 [43 13 44 56 76 14 90]
 [78 99 33 40 76 63 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Here is one possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Assign item 4 (value 99 for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 5 (value 78 for Agent 0).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign item 3 (value 56 for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 6 (value 90 for Agent 1).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign item 0 (value 78 for Agent 2).
   - Assign item 1 (value 99 for Agent 2).
   - Assign item 2 (value 33 for Agent 2).

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
