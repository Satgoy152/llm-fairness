Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  11  26  47   9  76  51
1   4  99  97  32  92  80  67
2  83  58  38  40  60  36  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 11 26 47  9 76 51]
 [ 4 99 97 32 92 80 67]
 [83 58 38 40 60 36 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the idea of maximizing the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. This helps to balance the allocations according to their preferences.

First, let's review the valuations of each agent for the items:

- Agent 0: [89, 11, 26, 47, 9, 76, 51]
- Agent 1: [4, 99, 97, 32, 92, 80, 67]
- Agent 2: [83, 58, 38, 40, 60, 36, 60]

Now, let's allocate the items to the agents by considering the highest values first:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 99).
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 97).
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 89).
4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 80).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 92).
6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (value 67).
7. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (value 40).

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5, 6],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 7.
