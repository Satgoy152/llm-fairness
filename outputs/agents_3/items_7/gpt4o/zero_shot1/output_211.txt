Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56   0  23  16  22  36  58
1  74  80  43  12  33  98  85
2   5  46  51  94  57   7  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 46 51 94 57  7 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that considers the valuations each agent has for the items. One way to do this is to ensure that each agent gets items such that their overall valuation is maximized while ensuring a fair distribution.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuations: [56, 0, 23, 16, 22, 36, 58]
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (58), Item 0 (56)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuations: [74, 80, 43, 12, 33, 98, 85]
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (98), Item 1 (80), Item 0 (74), Item 6 (85)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations: [5, 46, 51, 94, 57, 7, 90]
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (94), Item 6 (90)

Considering these valuations, we can allocate items to maximize fairness and valuation:

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for this item)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (second-highest valuation for this item)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for this item)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (second-highest valuation, and Agent 1 already has two items)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for this item)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation for this item)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation for this item)

Now, we'll present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations, and all 7 items are allocated.
