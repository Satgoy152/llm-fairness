Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  59  30  95   1  45  36
1  31   1  28  17  89  77  20
2  58  14  69  41  70  69  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize overall satisfaction by considering their valuations and ensuring an equitable distribution of items. Below is one possible allocation strategy to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: Has a high valuation for item 3 and relatively high valuations for items 1 and 2 compared to other items. It would be beneficial to allocate item 3 to Agent 0 for maximizing satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for item 4 and item 5. Allocating these items to Agent 1 would be beneficial.

3. **Agent 2**: Has relatively high valuations for items 0, 2, and 6. Allocating items to Agent 2 based on these valuations would be beneficial.

Considering the above strategy, we allocate items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 3]
- **Agent 1**: Items [4, 5]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 2, 6]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 6]
}
```
