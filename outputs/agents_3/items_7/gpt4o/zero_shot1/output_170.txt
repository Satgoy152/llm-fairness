Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  84  44  70  27  53  67
1  84  98  70  66  89  55  77
2  48   8  58  40  91  41  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should aim to maximize their total valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given there are 7 items, one strategy is to allocate approximately equal numbers of items to each agent or distribute them based on maximizing individual agent's valuations.

Let's check the valuations and try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0's preferences**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (84), Item 3 (70), Item 6 (67)

2. **Agent 1's preferences**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (98), Item 0 (84), Item 4 (89)

3. **Agent 2's preferences**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (91), Item 2 (58), Item 0 (48)

Let's try an allocation approach:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Assign Item 1 (84) and Item 3 (70)
  
- **Agent 1**:
  - Assign Item 0 (84), Item 4 (89), and Item 6 (77)
  
- **Agent 2**:
  - Assign Item 2 (58) and Item 5 (41)

This allocation considers each agent's high preference items and ensures all items are allocated. Each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
