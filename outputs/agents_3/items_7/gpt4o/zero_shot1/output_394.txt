Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  48  52  18  74   3  21
1  62  61  37  92  73  37  76
2  58  27   5  13   0  86  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that maximizes the overall satisfaction by considering the agents' valuations. A common method is to use the "max-sum" approach where we aim to maximize the sum of the allocated values for each agent. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. List each agent's valuation for each item.
2. Allocate items one by one by choosing the highest valued available item for any agent who has not yet reached a fair allocation of items.
3. Ensure that the total number of items allocated equals the total number of items available.

Considering that there are 7 items and 3 agents, we will aim to allocate approximately 2-3 items per agent.

Here's the allocation process:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 74, so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 92, so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest at 86, so we allocate item 5 to agent 2.
- Looking at the remaining items, agent 1 values item 6 the highest at 76, so we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 64 among remaining items, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- At this point, agent 0 has two items, agent 1 has two items, and agent 2 has one item.
- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 48 among remaining items, so we allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Finally, the only remaining item, item 2, is allocated to agent 2.

Now, each agent has been allocated the items based on their maximum valuations and all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5, 2]
}
```
