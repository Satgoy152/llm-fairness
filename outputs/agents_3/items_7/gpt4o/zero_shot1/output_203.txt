Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  75  79  29  59   9  84
1  77  42  36  26  67  45   1
2  31  44  60  78  14  86  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 73
   - Agent 1 values it at 77
   - Agent 2 values it at 31
   - Assign to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 75
   - Agent 1 values it at 42
   - Agent 2 values it at 44
   - Assign to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 79
   - Agent 1 values it at 36
   - Agent 2 values it at 60
   - Assign to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 29
   - Agent 1 values it at 26
   - Agent 2 values it at 78
   - Assign to Agent 2.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 59
   - Agent 1 values it at 67
   - Agent 2 values it at 14
   - Assign to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 9
   - Agent 1 values it at 45
   - Agent 2 values it at 86
   - Assign to Agent 2.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 84
   - Agent 1 values it at 1
   - Agent 2 values it at 68
   - Assign to Agent 0.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it the most, and all items are distributed among the agents.
