Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  20  97  21   5  86  43
1  80  87  47  35  86  16  59
2  18  56  82  48  91  75  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 3 agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated. This is often done by evaluating the values each agent assigns to each item and distributing the items in a way that each agent gets a relatively fair share of their preferred items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 46 + 20 + 97 + 21 + 5 + 86 + 43 = 318
   - Agent 1: 80 + 87 + 47 + 35 + 86 + 16 + 59 = 410
   - Agent 2: 18 + 56 + 82 + 48 + 91 + 75 + 96 = 466

2. **Determine initial allocations based on the highest value items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most.
   - Agent 2 values item 6 the most.

3. **Allocate these high-value items first to ensure each agent gets the item they value most**:
   - Agent 0 gets item 2.
   - Agent 1 gets item 1.
   - Agent 2 gets item 6.

4. **Allocate remaining items by considering the next highest preferences without conflicts**:
   - Agent 0: Next highest values are for items 5 and 0.
   - Agent 1: Next highest values are for items 4 and 0.
   - Agent 2: Next highest values are for items 4 and 5.

5. **Resolve the conflicts and finalize allocation**:
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest preference after item 2).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (next highest preference after item 6).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest preference after item 1).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (next highest preference).

6. **Final allocation**:
   - Agent 0 gets: [2, 5]
   - Agent 1 gets: [1, 0]
   - Agent 2 gets: [6, 4, 3]

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [6, 4, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives some items based on their preferences.
