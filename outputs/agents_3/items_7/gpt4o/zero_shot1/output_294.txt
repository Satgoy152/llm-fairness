Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  99  70   5  36  12  19
1  27  95  67  42  30  96  30
2  38   1  92  99  73  51  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's first analyze their preferences:

- Agent 0's highest valuations are for items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1's highest valuations are for items 1 and 5.
- Agent 2's highest valuations are for items 3 and 2.

To allocate the items fairly, we aim to assign items in a way that maximizes the value each agent gets, while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 1 (value 99)
  - Item 0 (value 14)

- Agent 1:
  - Item 5 (value 96)
  - Item 4 (value 30)
  - Item 6 (value 30)

- Agent 2:
  - Item 3 (value 99)
  - Item 2 (value 92)

This distribution gives each agent a fair share based on their highest preferences, ensuring all items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [5, 4, 6],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```
