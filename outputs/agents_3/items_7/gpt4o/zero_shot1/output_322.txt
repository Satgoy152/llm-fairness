Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  28  80   5  27  72  87
1  23  66   6  29  37  20  98
2  50  55  53  52  36   2  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on the given valuations, we can consider maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's break this down by considering each agent's highest-valued items and aiming for a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (87), Item 2 (80), Item 5 (72)
   - We'll assign Item 6 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for them.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (98), Item 1 (66), Item 4 (37)
   - Since Item 6 is already taken, we'll assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as it's the next highest value for them.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (50), Item 3 (52), Item 1 (55)
   - We'll assign Item 3 to Agent 2, as Item 1 is already taken and Item 3 has a high value for Agent 2.

Next, let's continue by assigning remaining items while considering fairness:

- Assign Item 2 (80) to Agent 0, as it is their next highest-valued item that remains.
- Assign Item 5 (20) to Agent 1, as it balances their allocation and is of relatively high value to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 0 (50) to Agent 2, as it is still highly valued by them and balances their allocation.
- Finally, assign Item 4 (36) to Agent 2, as it is still available and fits well with their allocations.

Now, checking the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [6, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 0, 4]

These allocations ensure each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 0, 4]
}
```
