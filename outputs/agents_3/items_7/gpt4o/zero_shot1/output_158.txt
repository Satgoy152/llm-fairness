Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  94  17  96  34   5  65
1  17  67  22  37  84  80  37
2  27  64  63  96  80  16  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17 67 22 37 84 80 37]
 [27 64 63 96 80 16 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the strategy of assigning items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's distribute the items based on the highest valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 33, Agent 1 values it at 17, Agent 2 values it at 27. Agent 0 values it the most, so item 0 goes to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 94, Agent 1 values it at 67, Agent 2 values it at 64. Agent 0 values it the most, so item 1 goes to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 17, Agent 1 values it at 22, Agent 2 values it at 63. Agent 2 values it the most, so item 2 goes to Agent 2.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 values it at 37, Agent 2 values it at 96. Both Agent 0 and Agent 2 value it equally, but let's assign it to Agent 0 to balance the allocations initially.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 values it at 84, Agent 2 values it at 80. Agent 1 values it the most, so item 4 goes to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 values it at 80, Agent 2 values it at 16. Agent 1 values it the most, so item 5 goes to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 values it at 37, Agent 2 values it at 19. Agent 0 values it the most, so item 6 goes to Agent 0.

Now let's check to ensure fairness and adjust if needed:
- Agent 0 has items [0, 1, 3, 6]
- Agent 1 has items [4, 5]
- Agent 2 has item [2]

This allocation seems fair given the valuations.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2]
}
```
