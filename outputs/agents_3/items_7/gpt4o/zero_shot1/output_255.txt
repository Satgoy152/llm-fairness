Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  45  62  91  13  86   0
1  64  69  17  63  56  11  59
2  53  74  72  45  25  62  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 74 72 45 25 62 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations of the items. One method is to use a greedy algorithm to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 42.
   - Agent 1 values it at 64.
   - Agent 2 values it at 53.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 45.
   - Agent 1 values it at 69.
   - Agent 2 values it at 74.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 62.
   - Agent 1 values it at 17.
   - Agent 2 values it at 72.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 91.
   - Agent 1 values it at 63.
   - Agent 2 values it at 45.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 13.
   - Agent 1 values it at 56.
   - Agent 2 values it at 25.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 86.
   - Agent 1 values it at 11.
   - Agent 2 values it at 62.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 0.
   - Agent 1 values it at 59.
   - Agent 2 values it at 23.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
