Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9   2  12  94  31  74   8
1  36  59  39  11  22  89  55
2   5  88  33  63  99  42  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [36 59 39 11 22 89 55]
 [ 5 88 33 63 99 42 65]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. This is a simplified example of the "assignment problem" which can be solved using various methods, one of which is the Hungarian algorithm. However, for simplicity, I will manually find a fair allocation based on the given valuations.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9   2  12  94  31  74   8
1  36  59  39  11  22  89  55
2   5  88  33  63  99  42  65
```

We will aim to allocate items to agents to maximize their total valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - The highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 3 (94).
   - Next highest is item 5 (74).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 5 (89), but it's already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Next highest is item 1 (59).
   - Then item 6 (55), but it is not optimal to take both from the same agent.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 4 (99).
   - Next is item 1 (88), but it's already allocated to Agent 1.

Let's proceed with allocation:

- Assign item 3 and 5 to Agent 0: Valuation = 94 + 74 = 168
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1: Valuation = 59
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2: Valuation = 99

Remaining items: 0, 2, 6

4. **For remaining items**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0: Valuation = 168 + 12 = 180
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1: Valuation = 59 + 55 = 114
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2: Valuation = 99 + 5 = 104

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed while maximizing each agent's total valuation where possible.
