Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  53  93  23  82  64  80
1  10  93  95  88   7  80  91
2  86  73  82  34  86  56  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [86 73 82 34 86 56 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Below is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the valuations for each agent:**

    - Agent 0: [10, 53, 93, 23, 82, 64, 80]
    - Agent 1: [10, 93, 95, 88, 7, 80, 91]
    - Agent 2: [86, 73, 82, 34, 86, 56, 72]

2. **Choose a method for allocation:**

    We'll use the following method:
    - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, as long as the agent does not exceed the number of items they are allowed to have (in this case, since there are 3 agents and 7 items, each agent should ideally get around 2-3 items).

3. **Allocate items:**

    - Item 0: Agent 2 (value: 86)
    - Item 1: Agent 1 (value: 93)
    - Item 2: Agent 1 (value: 95)
    - Item 3: Agent 1 (value: 88)
    - Item 4: Agent 0 (value: 82)
    - Item 5: Agent 0 (value: 64)
    - Item 6: Agent 1 (value: 91)

4. **Adjust to ensure fair distribution:**

    After initial allocation, Agent 1 has 4 items which is more than fair. We need to redistribute to ensure fairness:

    - Reassign Item 3 (value: 88) from Agent 1 to Agent 2, since Agent 2 values it the highest after Agent 1.

Now, each agent has a fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 3]

5. **Final JSON output:**

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fairly distributed number of items while also considering each agent's valuation of the items they receive.
