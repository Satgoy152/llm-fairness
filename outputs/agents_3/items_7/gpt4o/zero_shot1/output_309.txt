Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  94  60  41  79  40  98
1  46   9  18  48  81   9  87
2  33  83  36  22  46  92  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would get if they received their top-valued items.
2. Try to distribute the items so that each agent gets items that maximize their individual valuations while keeping the distribution fair.

Let's evaluate the top preferences for each agent:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 6: 98
  - Item 1: 94
  - Item 4: 79

- Agent 1:
  - Item 4: 81
  - Item 6: 87
  - Item 3: 48

- Agent 2:
  - Item 5: 92
  - Item 6: 91
  - Item 1: 83

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (value 98), as it is their highest valued item.
2. Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (value 92), as it is their highest valued item.
3. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (value 81), as it is their highest valued item.
4. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 94), as it is their second-highest valued item.
5. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (value 48), as it is their second-highest valued item.
6. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 20), as it is their third-highest valued item.
7. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (value 36), ensuring Agent 2 gets at least two items.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items maximizing their valuation while keeping the distribution fair.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
