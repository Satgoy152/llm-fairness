Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   5  86  87  47  67  35  72
1  50  49  16  66  75  99  58
2  98   2  37  73  99  99  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 5 86 87 47 67 35 72]
 [50 49 16 66 75 99 58]
 [98  2 37 73 99 99 64]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: 2, 6
   - Valuations: 87, 72
   - Total valuation: 159

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: 1, 5
   - Valuations: 49, 99
   - Total valuation: 148

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items: 0, 3, 4
   - Valuations: 98, 73, 99
   - Total valuation: 270

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and it distributes the total value among the agents in a balanced manner.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation has been made by considering the valuations and ensuring all items are allocated fairly.
