Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  96   4  56  22  32  74
1  65  51  98  90  28  78  71
2  88  16  79  38  22  14  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim for a distribution that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 7 items and 3 agents, one agent will receive 3 items, and the other two agents will receive 2 items each.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0's highest-valued items:**  
   - Item 1: Value 96
   - Item 6: Value 74

2. **Agent 1's highest-valued items:**  
   - Item 2: Value 98
   - Item 3: Value 90

3. **Agent 2's highest-valued items:**  
   - Item 0: Value 88
   - Item 4: Value 22

Now, to distribute the remaining items:

- Agent 0 has items [1, 6]
- Agent 1 has items [2, 3]
- Agent 2 has items [0, 4]

The remaining item is item 5. We will allocate it to the agent who has the highest valuation for it and currently has fewer than 3 items. This is Agent 1, with a valuation of 78.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 6]
- Agent 1: [2, 3, 5]
- Agent 2: [0, 4]

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
