Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  74   9  62  55  58  23
1  77  26  57  58  20  73  74
2  31  48  26  31  96  36  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 48 26 31 96 36 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value received by each agent is balanced. We will try to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and make an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values are [20, 74, 9, 62, 55, 58, 23]
2. **Agent 1**: Values are [77, 26, 57, 58, 20, 73, 74]
3. **Agent 2**: Values are [31, 48, 26, 31, 96, 36, 67]

A possible fair allocation strategy is:
- Assign items to maximize the minimum total value for each agent.
- Ensure each agent gets at least one valuable item if possible.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 1 (74) and 3 (62). We'll allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 0 (77) and 6 (74). We'll allocate item 0 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 4 (96). We'll allocate item 4 to agent 2.

Now, distribute the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Can benefit from item 5 (58). Allocate item 5 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Can benefit from item 3 (58). Allocate item 3 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Can benefit from items 6 (67) and 2 (26). Allocate item 6 to agent 2 and item 2 to agent 2.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 6, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all 7 items are allocated.
