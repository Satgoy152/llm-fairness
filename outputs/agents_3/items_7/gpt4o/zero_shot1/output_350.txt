Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  24  20  31  13  35   3
1  20  15  12  11  65  19  23
2  21  17  91  84  76  45  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that all items are assigned. One approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's evaluate the valuations:

```
Items:
     0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0: [53, 24, 20, 31, 13, 35,  3]
1: [20, 15, 12, 11, 65, 19, 23]
2: [21, 17, 91, 84, 76, 45, 42]
```

Let's assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (53).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (24).
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (91).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (84).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (65).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (45).
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (42).

Now, let's ensure that the allocation is fair and balanced. Agent 2 has four items, which might seem unbalanced. However, since we are maximizing the satisfaction based on each item's value, we should proceed with this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while all items are distributed.
