Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  40  69  25  74  68   7
1  72  53  77  63  95  16  80
2  68   3  85  46  27  59  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [68  3 85 46 27 59 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's how we can allocate the items based on the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Best item choices based on valuations: Item 4 (74), Item 2 (69), Item 5 (68)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Best item choices based on valuations: Item 4 (95), Item 2 (77), Item 6 (80)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Best item choices based on valuations: Item 2 (85), Item 6 (85), Item 5 (59)

Given that we have to allocate all 7 items, let's try to fairly distribute them:

- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation (95).
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation (85).
- Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1, as they have the next highest valuation (80).
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0, as Agent 2 and 1 have already received high-value items.
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, as they have a decent valuation for it (51).
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 0 and 2 do not have high valuations for it.
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as they have the highest remaining valuation for it (40).

Thus, the final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [2]
}
```
