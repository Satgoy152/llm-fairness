Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  76   0  33  19  13  30
1  20  22  59  69  37  16  44
2  71   9  38  29  16  36  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 76  0 33 19 13 30]
 [20 22 59 69 37 16 44]
 [71  9 38 29 16 36 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation across all agents. One approach is to assign items to agents in a way that optimizes their individual valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the allocation step by step:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items: 0 (92), 1 (76), 3 (33)
   - Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0 for maximum valuation.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 3 (69), 2 (59), 6 (44)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 as it provides the highest valuation in comparison to other agents.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 0 (71), 6 (71), 5 (36)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as item 0 is already taken and item 6 provides a high valuation.

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 2: Best valuation by Agent 1 (59)
   - Item 4: Valuations are relatively low; Assign to Agent 1 for balancing.
   - Item 5: Assign to Agent 2 for a moderate valuation.

Now, let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation distributes the 7 items while considering the agents' valuations and ensuring all items are allocated.
