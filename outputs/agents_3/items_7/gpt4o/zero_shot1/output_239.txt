Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96   0  93  84  64  50  13
1  12  99  17  20  55  86  23
2  75  80   8  17  92  86  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing the total valuation, we can use a method such as the "maximum weight matching" in a bipartite graph. In this problem, the agents and items form the two sets of the bipartite graph, and the valuations serve as the weights for the edges between them. The goal is to maximize the sum of the valuations for the assigned items, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

To achieve a fair allocation, we should consider each agent's highest valued items and attempt to distribute the items to maximize overall satisfaction. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (96), Item 2 (93), Item 3 (84)
   - Assign Item 0 and Item 2

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (99), Item 5 (86)
   - Assign Item 1 and Item 5

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (92), Item 5 (86)
   - Assign Item 4 and Item 6

Now, let's check the allocation to ensure all 7 items are allocated and each item is assigned only once:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 5
- Agent 2: Items 4 and 6

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their preferences.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
