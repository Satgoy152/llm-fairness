Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  77  43   9  91   7  66
1  40  25  20  52  62  54  36
2  34  15  69  35  71  57   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [34 15 69 35 71 57  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all 7 items are distributed. We'll follow the approach of maximizing each agent's satisfaction by considering their highest-valued items first and attempting to strike a balance.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 92, 77, 43, 9, 91, 7, 66
- Agent 1 values: 40, 25, 20, 52, 62, 54, 36
- Agent 2 values: 34, 15, 69, 35, 71, 57, 3

We will allocate items based on these values:

1. Assign the highest valued item of each agent initially:
   - Item 0 to Agent 0 (92)
   - Item 4 to Agent 2 (71)
   - Item 5 to Agent 1 (54)

2. Next, assign the next highest valued item that hasn't been assigned:
   - Item 1 to Agent 0 (77)
   - Item 2 to Agent 2 (69)
   
3. Continue assigning the highest available valued items:
   - Item 6 to Agent 1 (36)
   - Item 3 to Agent 1 (52)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 6, 3],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```
