Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  82  75  40   6  19  75
1  35  95  69  29  96  26  90
2  43  93  34  40  33  38  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their preferences. One approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm where we allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most (43).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most (95).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (75).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (40).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most (96).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most (38).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most (75).

Allocations ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
