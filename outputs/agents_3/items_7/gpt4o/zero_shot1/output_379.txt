Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  66  68  38  53  47  58
1  32  60  31  10  63  57  75
2  95  68   8  17  97  22   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Each agent should get approximately the same total value or as close as possible given the constraints.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Total Values for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 76, 66, 68, 38, 53, 47, 58
   - Agent 1: 32, 60, 31, 10, 63, 57, 75
   - Agent 2: 95, 68, 8, 17, 97, 22, 4

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - To maximize fairness, try to assign high-value items to different agents. 

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Agent 0 values: 76, 66, 68, 38, 53, 47, 58
   - Agent 1 values: 32, 60, 31, 10, 63, 57, 75
   - Agent 2 values: 95, 68, 8, 17, 97, 22, 4

   - Allocate the highest value item that no other agent values more:
     - Item 0 to Agent 2 (value 95)
     - Item 4 to Agent 2 (value 97)
     - Item 6 to Agent 1 (value 75)
     - Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 66)
     - Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 68)
     - Item 5 to Agent 1 (value 57)
     - Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 38)

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Ensure each agent has a fair allocation in terms of item count and value.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items to the agents in a way that tries to balance the total value each agent receives.
