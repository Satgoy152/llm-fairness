Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  18  92  60  94  51  54
1  80  73  26  29  47  62  52
2  25  74  43  13  84  64  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 18 92 60 94 51 54]
 [80 73 26 29 47 62 52]
 [25 74 43 13 84 64 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, a reasonable approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We can use a greedy method to allocate items by checking which agent values each item the most and assigning the item to that agent. Here's a step-by-step allocation for this scenario:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 25.
   - Agent 1 values it at 80.
   - Agent 2 values it at 25.
   - **Assign to Agent 1** (highest value of 80).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 18.
   - Agent 1 values it at 73.
   - Agent 2 values it at 74.
   - **Assign to Agent 2** (highest value of 74).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 92.
   - Agent 1 values it at 26.
   - Agent 2 values it at 43.
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (highest value of 92).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 60.
   - Agent 1 values it at 29.
   - Agent 2 values it at 13.
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (highest value of 60).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 94.
   - Agent 1 values it at 47.
   - Agent 2 values it at 84.
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (highest value of 94).

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 51.
   - Agent 1 values it at 62.
   - Agent 2 values it at 64.
   - **Assign to Agent 2** (highest value of 64).

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 54.
   - Agent 1 values it at 52.
   - Agent 2 values it at 72.
   - **Assign to Agent 2** (highest value of 72).

Now we can summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items valued highly by them.
