Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  53  35  13   4  77  50
1  85  61  95  25   8  60  34
2  44  73  53  10  49  29  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[39 53 35 13  4 77 50]
 [85 61 95 25  8 60 34]
 [44 73 53 10 49 29 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation each agent gets. One way to do this is by using an algorithm such as the Hungarian method for optimal assignment, but given the simplicity of the problem, I will manually assign based on maximizing each agent's total value.

Here are the valuations from each agent's perspective:

- Agent 0: [39, 53, 35, 13, 4, 77, 50]
- Agent 1: [85, 61, 95, 25, 8, 60, 34]
- Agent 2: [44, 73, 53, 10, 49, 29, 55]

We can allocate the items to maximize the sum of valuations as follows:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, since it's the highest valuation (95) for that item.
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest (77).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest (73).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (85).
5. Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest (55).
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest (49).
7. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest (13).

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences:

- Agent 0: [5, 3]
- Agent 1: [2, 0]
- Agent 2: [1, 6, 4]

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [1, 6, 4]
}
```
