Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  49  93  94  19  59  50
1  64  43  33  89   6  32  84
2  15  34  46  27  53  68  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 43 33 89  6 32 84]
 [15 34 46 27 53 68 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (since there are 3 agents and 7 items). We will analyze the valuations and try to distribute the items accordingly.

1. Let's first identify the highest valuations for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Highest valued items are 3 (94), 2 (93), 0 (79)
   - Agent 1: Highest valued items are 6 (84), 3 (89), 0 (64)
   - Agent 2: Highest valued items are 6 (92), 5 (68), 4 (53)

2. Let's try allocating items based on the highest individual valuations while ensuring a fair distribution:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 3 (94)
  - Item 2 (93)

- Agent 1:
  - Item 6 (84)
  - Item 0 (64)

- Agent 2:
  - Item 5 (68)
  - Item 4 (53)
  - Item 1 (34)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items and aims to maximize their individual valuations.

3. Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [5, 4, 1]
}
```

This allocation uses all 7 items and ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
