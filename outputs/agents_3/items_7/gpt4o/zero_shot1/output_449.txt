Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  35  60  38  21  26  50
1  81   1  74  53  35  56  21
2  21  67  23   2  83  14  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[80 35 60 38 21 26 50]
 [81  1 74 53 35 56 21]
 [21 67 23  2 83 14 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method called "maximum total valuation," which aims to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences for the items. We will also ensure that each agent receives at least one item, considering there are three agents and seven items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0's preferences**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (80)
   - Next highest: Item 2 (60)
   - Next: Item 6 (50)

2. **Agent 1's preferences**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (81) - already taken
   - Next highest: Item 2 (74) - already taken
   - Next: Item 5 (56)
   - Next: Item 3 (53)

3. **Agent 2's preferences**:
   - Highest value: Item 6 (86) - already taken
   - Next highest: Item 4 (83)
   - Next: Item 1 (67)
   - Next: Item 0 (21) - already taken

Allocating based on the highest remaining preferences:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2

With this allocation, each agent receives items based on their highest available preferences, and all 7 items are allocated.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

Each agent gets items that maximize their valuation given the constraints, and all items are allocated.
