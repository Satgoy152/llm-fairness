Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  51  45  41  31   6  12
1  86  86  73   6  41  99  35
2  72  23  91  63  54  71  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 51 45 41 31  6 12]
 [86 86 73  6 41 99 35]
 [72 23 91 63 54 71 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 3 agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. This means we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that the total value received by each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  51  45  41  31   6  12
1  86  86  73   6  41  99  35
2  72  23  91  63  54  71  62
```

To maximize fairness, we can proceed with the following allocation:

1. Agent 0 should get the highest-valued items available to them. Items 0, 1, and 2 are highly valued by Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 5 (both 86 and 99).
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 2 (91) and item 5 (71).

Let's try allocating based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction while ensuring all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 1 (values 91 and 51, total 142)
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 5 and 6 (values 99 and 35, total 134)
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 2, 3, and 4 (values 91, 63, and 54, total 208)

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This configuration ensures each agent receives items, and all items are allocated while keeping the allocations as balanced as possible based on the given valuations.
