Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  91  54  51  34  50   8
1  76  24  33  11  46   8  39
2  72  71  71  83  94  21  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[48 91 54 51 34 50  8]
 [76 24 33 11 46  8 39]
 [72 71 71 83 94 21 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 91. Assign item 1 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 76. Assign item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 6 the highest at 98. Assign item 6 to agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Now, items 2, 3, 4, and 5 are left. We should allocate these to maximize the remaining value for each agent while ensuring fairness.

5. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 2 at 71, which is the highest among the remaining agents. Assign item 2 to agent 2.

6. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 2 values item 3 at 83, which is the highest. Assign item 3 to agent 2.

7. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 2 values item 4 at 94, which is the highest. Assign item 4 to agent 2.

8. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 at 50, which is the highest. Assign item 5 to agent 0.

Now, we have allocated all 7 items. Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers the values each agent has for the items and ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences.
