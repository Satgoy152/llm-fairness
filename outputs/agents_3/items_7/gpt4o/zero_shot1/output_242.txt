Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  55  44  56  38   0  46
1  77  43  83  18  46  43  44
2  83  77  74  18  73  51  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and find a way to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

First, let's consider the highest valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's highest valuations: Item 0 (65), Item 3 (56), Item 1 (55)
- Agent 1's highest valuations: Item 2 (83), Item 0 (77)
- Agent 2's highest valuations: Item 0 (83), Item 1 (77)

Now, let's try to allocate the items in a way that each agent receives a fair share:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2, as it has the highest valuation for Agent 2.
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as it has the highest valuation for Agent 1.
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 2, as it is the second-highest valuation for Agent 2.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, as it is one of the highest valuations for Agent 0.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1, as it has a decent valuation for Agent 1.
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 2, as it has a decent valuation for Agent 2.
7. Assign Item 6 to Agent 0, as it is the only remaining item, and Agent 0 doesn't have many items yet.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some items, and the distribution is as fair as possible given the valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
