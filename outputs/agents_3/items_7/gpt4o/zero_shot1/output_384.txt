Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  31  91  48   1   9  81
1  46  26  39   8  51   0  22
2  85  41  61  99  11  28  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. One common approach is to use a method that considers maximizing the minimum value that each agent receives, ensuring fairness in the allocation. Let's go through the process:

1. **List the valuations**:
   - Agent 0 valuations: [57, 31, 91, 48, 1, 9, 81]
   - Agent 1 valuations: [46, 26, 39, 8, 51, 0, 22]
   - Agent 2 valuations: [85, 41, 61, 99, 11, 28, 57]

2. **Allocate items**:
   - Prioritize items based on the highest valuation for each item across all agents, assigning the item to the agent who values it most.
   - Repeat this process while ensuring each agent receives a fair distribution of items.

Following these steps, let's allocate items:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 85 (Agent 2).
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 41 (Agent 2).
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 91 (Agent 0).
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 99 (Agent 2).
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 51 (Agent 1).
- **Item 5**: Highest value is 28 (Agent 2).
- **Item 6**: Highest value is 81 (Agent 0).

Now, let's distribute the items considering a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 6.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 1, 3, and 5.

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 and Agent 2 receive more items due to higher valuations, while Agent 1, who has lower valuations, receives a smaller number of items with a relatively high value.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1, 3, 5]
}
```
