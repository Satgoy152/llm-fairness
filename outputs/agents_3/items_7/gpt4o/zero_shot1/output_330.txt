Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  37  72  87   8  82  68
1  74  83  43  57  31  14  66
2  64  19  39  80   1  42  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[14 37 72 87  8 82 68]
 [74 83 43 57 31 14 66]
 [64 19 39 80  1 42 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that balances the total valuation each agent receives. One way to achieve this is to use the maximin fairness approach, which ensures that the agent with the lowest total valuation receives as high a value as possible. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item Across All Agents:**
   - Item 0: 14 + 74 + 64 = 152
   - Item 1: 37 + 83 + 19 = 139
   - Item 2: 72 + 43 + 39 = 154
   - Item 3: 87 + 57 + 80 = 224
   - Item 4: 8 + 31 + 1 = 40
   - Item 5: 82 + 14 + 42 = 138
   - Item 6: 68 + 66 + 23 = 157

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Fairness:**
   - **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with the highest value for Agent 0.
     - Assign Item 3 (value 87), Item 2 (value 72).
   - **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with the highest value for Agent 1.
     - Assign Item 0 (value 74), Item 1 (value 83).
   - **Agent 2**: Prioritize items with the highest value for Agent 2.
     - Assign Item 6 (value 23), Item 4 (value 1).
   - **Remaining Items**: Assign the remaining item to the agent who maximizes their minimum valuation.
     - Assign Item 5 (value 42 for Agent 2).

3. **Verify Allocation:**
   - Each agent has an allocation of items that ensures a fairly distributed total valuation.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [3, 2]
   - Agent 1: [0, 1]
   - Agent 2: [6, 4, 5]

Now, here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [6, 4, 5]
}
```
