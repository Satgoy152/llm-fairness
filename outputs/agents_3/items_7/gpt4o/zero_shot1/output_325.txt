Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  97  12  21   5  33  92
1  90  33  91  89  60  31  52
2  50  64  78  27  16  22  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 2 and 3.
3. **Agent 2** can take the remaining items, 4 and 5.

Let's allocate the items based on this strategy:

- **Agent 0** receives items 0, 1, and 6.
- **Agent 1** receives items 2 and 3.
- **Agent 2** receives items 4 and 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences while all 7 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation meets the requirement that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.
