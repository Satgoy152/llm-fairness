Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  48  88  32  83   9  51
1  95  40  61  33  16  64  39
2  19  66  24  63  77  80  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Let's analyze the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 98     | 48     | 88     | 32     | 83     | 9      | 51     |
| 1     | 95     | 40     | 61     | 33     | 16     | 64     | 39     |
| 2     | 19     | 66     | 24     | 63     | 77     | 80     | 72     |

A good strategy is to assign the items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring each agent ends up with a fair number of items.

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 98.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most at 66.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 88.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most at 63.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most at 77.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most at 80.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most at 72.

From this, it seems Agent 2 has very high valuations for multiple items, so we should ensure a more balanced distribution.

Reassign to balance:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1: Items 5 and 6.
- Agent 2: Items 1, 3, and 4.

This allocation gives each agent at least two items when possible and respects the highest valuation for each item as much as possible.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of allocated items is 7.
