Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  29  23   2  76  38  21
1  76  87  70  92  80  35  61
2  10  80  30  16  62  73  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98 29 23  2 76 38 21]
 [76 87 70 92 80 35 61]
 [10 80 30 16 62 73 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to maximize the value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. We can use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is a breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 98.
   - Agent 1 values it at 76.
   - Agent 2 values it at 10.
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 29.
   - Agent 1 values it at 87.
   - Agent 2 values it at 80.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 23.
   - Agent 1 values it at 70.
   - Agent 2 values it at 30.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 2.
   - Agent 1 values it at 92.
   - Agent 2 values it at 16.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 76.
   - Agent 1 values it at 80.
   - Agent 2 values it at 62.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value).

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 38.
   - Agent 1 values it at 35.
   - Agent 2 values it at 73.
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value).

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 21.
   - Agent 1 values it at 61.
   - Agent 2 values it at 72.
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value).

Now let's organize this into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated to the agent that values it the most, while respecting the constraint of each agent receiving an integer number of items.
