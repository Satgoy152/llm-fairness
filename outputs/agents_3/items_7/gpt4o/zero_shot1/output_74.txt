Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  36  73  38  15  28  98
1  47  68  51  42  56  65  98
2  15  26  94  61  73  51  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value for each agent or ensuring that each agent gets a relatively fair share based on their valuations. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items that agent 0 values highly.
   - Items 2 (value 73) and 6 (value 98) have the highest values for agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Assign items that agent 1 values highly but are not taken by agent 0.
   - Item 1 (value 68) and item 5 (value 65) have relatively high values for agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Assign the remaining items, focusing on those they value highly.
   - Item 3 (value 61) and item 4 (value 73) are valuable for agent 2.

By following this strategy, we ensure that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they have relatively high valuations for, given the constraints.
