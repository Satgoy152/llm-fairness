Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  35  15  34  49  23   8
1   3  61  41  23  93  12   0
2   6  12   5  61  88  93  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We will review the valuations and attempt to distribute the items as equitably as possible.

#### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (49), Item 3 (34), Item 1 (35)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (93), Item 1 (61), Item 2 (41)
   - Item 4 is already allocated. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (93), Item 6 (90), Item 4 (88)
   - Item 4 is already allocated. Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2.
   
4. **Remaining items to allocate: 0, 2, 3, 6**

5. **Agent 0:**
   - Remaining highest valuation: Item 3 (34), Item 1 (35)
   - Item 1 is already allocated. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1:**
   - Remaining highest valuation: Item 2 (41)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2:**
   - Remaining highest valuation: Item 6 (90)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2.

8. **Remaining item to allocate: 0**

9. **Agent 0:**
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

The allocations ensure each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences, maximizing their total valuations.

#### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```
