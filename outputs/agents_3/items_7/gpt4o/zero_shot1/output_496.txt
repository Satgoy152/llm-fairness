Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81   1  63  45  77  30  82
1  29  28  57  12  16  90  39
2  69  77  36  48  40  93  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent or distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share. Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: 
Items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Values: 81, 1, 63, 45, 77, 30, 82

Agent 1:
Items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Values: 29, 28, 57, 12, 16, 90, 39

Agent 2:
Items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Values: 69, 77, 36, 48, 40, 93, 71
```

Let's try to allocate the items to maximize the satisfaction for each agent. One potential way is as follows:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 81 for Agent 0, highest among agents for item 0).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value 77 for Agent 2, highest among agents for item 1).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 57 for Agent 1, highest among agents for item 2).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (value 48 for Agent 2, highest among agents for item 3).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (value 77 for Agent 0, highest among agents for item 4).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 90 for Agent 1, highest among agents for item 5).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value 82 for Agent 0, highest among agents for item 6).

This allocation method ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
