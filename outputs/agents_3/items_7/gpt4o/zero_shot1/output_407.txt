Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  66  94  25  54  83   1
1  98  97  95  62  12  98  70
2  86  21  65   3  60  36  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 21 65  3 60 36 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0's Allocations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 highly with a value of 94, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 also values item 0 with a value of 87, which is quite high, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1's Allocations:**
   - Agent 1 values item 1 highly with a value of 97, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 also values item 5 with a value of 98, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 values item 6 with a value of 70, which is higher than other agents' values, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2's Allocations:**
   - Agent 2 values item 4 with a value of 60, which is the highest valuation for this item, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 compared to other agents, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Thus, each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
