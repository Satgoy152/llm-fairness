Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  74  87   1  82  15  20
1  84   7   5  92  23  49  13
2   0  72   9   4  46  94  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. This can often be approached as an optimization problem, such as using the Hungarian algorithm for assignments. However, for simplicity, we can use a heuristic approach to distribute the items based on their valuations.

Let's distribute the items based on the highest valuations for each agent.

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (87), Item 4 (82), Item 0 (81)
   
2. Agent 1:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (92), Item 0 (84)
   
3. Agent 2:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (94), Item 6 (92), Item 1 (72)

Now, we proceed with assignments ensuring each item is given to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (value 81)
- Item 1: Agent 2 (value 72)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (value 87)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (value 92)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (value 82)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (value 94)
- Item 6: Agent 2 (value 92)

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives the items they value the most while all items are distributed, and the total number of items allocated is 7.
