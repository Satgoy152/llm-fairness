Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  90  17  45  14  59  85
1  33  54  22  73  37  13  50
2  50  15  87  46  24  68  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[18 90 17 45 14 59 85]
 [33 54 22 73 37 13 50]
 [50 15 87 46 24 68 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy approach to maximize the total valuation by assigning items to the agent who values them the most. Here's how we can do it:

1. List all the items and their valuations by agents.
2. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
3. Assign the item to that agent.
4. Repeat until all items are allocated.

Let's go through this process with the given data:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 50.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 90.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 87.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 73.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 37.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 68.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 85.

Allocating based on the highest valuations, we have:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 6.
- Agent 1 gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 2, and 5.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
