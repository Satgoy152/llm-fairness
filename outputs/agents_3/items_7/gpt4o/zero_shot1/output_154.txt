Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20   3  27   1  42  91   6
1  91  99  58  35  40  85   6
2  11  26  93  61  53  29  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 99 58 35 40 85  6]
 [11 26 93 61 53 29 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 5 the highest at 91. Thus, we allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 1 the highest at 99. We allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 2 the highest at 93. We allocate item 2 to agent 2.

Next, we continue to allocate the remaining items:

4. For item 0, agent 1 values it the most at 91. We allocate item 0 to agent 1.
5. For item 3, agent 2 values it the most at 61. We allocate item 3 to agent 2.
6. For item 4, agent 0 values it the most at 42. We allocate item 4 to agent 0.
7. For item 6, agent 2 values it the most at 45. We allocate item 6 to agent 2.

This allocation gives each agent a set of items that maximizes their individual valuations based on the given data.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 3 agents.
