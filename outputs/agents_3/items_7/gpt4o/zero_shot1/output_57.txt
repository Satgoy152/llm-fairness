Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  70  99  55  29  98  78
1  41   6   1  70  95  39  46
2  77  56  50  74  83  38  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41  6  1 70 95 39 46]
 [77 56 50 74 83 38 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to ensure a fair distribution based on these valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [55, 70, 99, 55, 29, 98, 78]
- Agent 1: [41, 6, 1, 70, 95, 39, 46]
- Agent 2: [77, 56, 50, 74, 83, 38, 21]

A reasonable approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation among the agents for each item. This ensures each item is given to the agent who values it the most.

1. Item 0: Highest value by Agent 2 (77)
2. Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (70)
3. Item 2: Highest value by Agent 0 (99)
4. Item 3: Highest value by Agent 2 (74)
5. Item 4: Highest value by Agent 1 (95)
6. Item 5: Highest value by Agent 0 (98)
7. Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (78)

Now, let's allocate these items accordingly:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 3]

Finally, the allocations can be presented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
