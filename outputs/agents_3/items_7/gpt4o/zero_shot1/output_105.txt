Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  61  89  20  82  20  61
1  69  57  42  31   4  46  41
2  96  35  37  87  23  10  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96 35 37 87 23 10 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 3 agents, we should try to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most (89), so we can assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (69), so we can assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the most (96), but since item 0 is already assigned, agent 2's next highest valuation is for item 3 (87), so we assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. Now, let's look for the best remaining items for each agent:
   - Agent 0's next highest available item is item 4 (82).
   - Agent 1's next highest available item is item 1 (57).
   - Agent 2 has already received item 3, so we should now assign remaining items based on remaining highest values.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as it is their next highest available item.
6. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as it is their next highest unassigned item.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0, as it is their next highest unassigned item.
8. Finally, assign item 5 to agent 1, as it is their next highest unassigned item.

Given this allocation strategy, here is the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent receives items according to their highest values as much as possible.
