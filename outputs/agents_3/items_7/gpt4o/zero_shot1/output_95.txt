Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  65  60  10  30  30  71
1  13  90  63  97  30  88  30
2  54  70   7  85  15  63   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's a possible strategy:

1. Start by identifying the highest value each agent has for any item, and try to allocate those items first.
2. Consider the overall distribution of values and ensure each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences.

Using this strategy, let's make the allocations:

- Agent 0's highest value is 71 for item 6.
- Agent 1's highest value is 97 for item 3.
- Agent 2's highest value is 70 for item 1.

Following these top preferences:

- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0: Next highest value is for item 1 (which is already taken by Agent 2), so the next choice is item 0 with a value of 51.
- Agent 1: Next highest value is for item 5 with a value of 88.
- Agent 2: Next highest value is for item 0 (which is already taken by Agent 0), so the next choice is item 3, but it is taken by Agent 1. Next is item 5 (taken), and item 2 with a value of 7.

Considering the above choices, let's complete the allocation:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 as it offers a value of 30, and Agent 1 has already received a fair share.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (already done).

After these allocations, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has received items and their preferences have been considered as much as possible within the constraints.
