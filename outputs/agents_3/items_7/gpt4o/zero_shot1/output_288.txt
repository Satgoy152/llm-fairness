Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  80  99  81   9  20  39
1  15  80  42  61  40  84  49
2  67  74  42  89  90  28  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a method to ensure a balanced distribution based on the agents' valuations. Let's aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their overall satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 2 (99), 1 (80), 3 (81)
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 5 (84), 1 (80), 3 (61)
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (90), 3 (89), 1 (74)

Let's prioritize giving each agent their most valued item first, and then distribute the rest as fairly as possible. We should ensure that each agent gets at least two items, considering we have 7 items in total.

Here's a balanced allocation based on maximizing total value for all agents:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2] 
  - Value from 0: 18, Value from 2: 99
- **Agent 1**: Items [5, 6]
  - Value from 5: 84, Value from 6: 49
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 3, 4]
  - Value from 1: 74, Value from 3: 89, Value from 4: 90

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable number of their high-value items.

Here is the final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
