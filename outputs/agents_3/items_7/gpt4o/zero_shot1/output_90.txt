Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54   6  12  60  56  25  24
1   6   1  13   6  12  44  88
2  28  38  44  63   6  74  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of items. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Sort by Valuation:** Prioritize items based on the highest valuation by any agent. This helps ensure that items with the highest perceived value are allocated to the agent who values them the most.

2. **Round-Robin Allocation:** Once the highest-value items are allocated, distribute the remaining items in a manner that ensures each agent receives a roughly equal number of items.

Let’s allocate the items based on these principles:

- **Item 3:** Highest value is 63 by Agent 2.
- **Item 6:** Next highest value is 88 by Agent 1.
- **Item 0:** Next highest value is 54 by Agent 0.
- **Item 5:** Next highest value is 74 by Agent 2.
- **Item 4:** Next highest value is 56 by Agent 0.
- **Item 2:** Next highest value is 44 by Agent 2.
- **Item 1:** Last item, allocate to Agent 0 who currently has fewer items.

Based on this allocation strategy, here’s the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly among the agents, with each agent receiving a number of items proportional to their valuations.
