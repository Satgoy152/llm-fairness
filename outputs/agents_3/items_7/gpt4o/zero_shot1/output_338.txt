Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  73   5  99   0  42   3
1   2  65   8  33  81  31  56
2  75  16  17  81  52  82  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 73  5 99  0 42  3]
 [ 2 65  8 33 81 31 56]
 [75 16 17 81 52 82 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and aim to maximize the total satisfaction. We will try to assign items to agents in such a way that each agent gets at least one item and the total value for each agent is balanced. 

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (99), followed by item 0 (95).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (81), followed by item 1 (65).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (82), followed by item 3 (81).

A possible allocation strategy could be:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Distribute the remaining items based on secondary preferences to balance the total valuations.

Following this strategy, here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 3 to agent 0, as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 4 to agent 1, as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 5 to agent 2, as it is their highest valued item.

Now, let’s allocate the remaining items:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0, boosting their valuation significantly.
- Assign item 1 to agent 1, as it's the next highest for them.
- Assign item 6 to agent 2, as it helps balance their total valuation.
- Assign item 2 to agent 1, as it’s a less valued item but helps balance the distribution.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3 with valuations 95 and 99 respectively.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, and 4 with valuations 65, 8, and 81 respectively.
- Agent 2 receives items 5 and 6 with valuations 82 and 71 respectively.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes their satisfaction based on the given valuations.
