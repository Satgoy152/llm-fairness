Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  16  61  31  25  70  16
1  89  83  66  53  76  41  74
2  85  80  65  27  80  65  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[37 16 61 31 25 70 16]
 [89 83 66 53 76 41 74]
 [85 80 65 27 80 65 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 3 agents, we aim to assign items such that each agent receives a reasonable value from their allocated items. We'll focus on maximizing the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and exactly 7 items are allocated in total.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 5 (70). We will assign item 5 to agent 0 to maximize their total valuation.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has the highest valuations for items 0 (89) and 1 (83). We will assign these items to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuations for items 4 (80), 2 (65), and 6 (71). We will assign these items to agent 2.

This leaves item 3 unassigned, and we will allocate it to agent 2 as well to ensure that all items are allocated.

The allocations can be presented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
