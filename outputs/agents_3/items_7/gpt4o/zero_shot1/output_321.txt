Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  67  42   3  68  62   8
1  74  93  12  24  45   7  80
2  22  91  43  99  70  62  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [22 91 43 99 70 62 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction given their valuations, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest value for each item among all agents and allocate that item to the corresponding agent.
2. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while all items are allocated.

Following this approach, we allocate the items as follows:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it highest at 97.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it highest at 91.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it highest at 42.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it highest at 99.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it highest at 70.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it highest at 62.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it highest at 80.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives item 6.
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 3, and 4.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
