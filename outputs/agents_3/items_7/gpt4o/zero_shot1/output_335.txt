Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  20  11  13  77  89  50
1  20  91  41  66  56  91  38
2   2  39  80  77  32  65  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84 20 11 13 77 89 50]
 [20 91 41 66 56 91 38]
 [ 2 39 80 77 32 65 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value 84
   - Item 4: Value 77
   - Total Value = 161

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1: Value 91
   - Item 5: Value 91
   - Total Value = 182

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2: Value 80
   - Item 3: Value 77
   - Item 6: Value 25
   - Total Value = 182

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all 7 items are distributed.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
