Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  18  70  87  27  94  49
1  41  35  91  31  55   7  95
2  45  14   2  49  76  68  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 7 items among 3 agents such that each agent gets a fair allocation based on the given valuations. One way to approach this is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values for Agent 0 are items 5 (94) and 3 (87).
   - Allocate items 5 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values for Agent 1 are items 6 (95) and 2 (91).
   - Allocate items 6 and 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values for Agent 2 are items 4 (76) and 6 (78), but item 6 is already taken.
   - Allocate items 4 and remaining items (0, 1) to Agent 2.

After this allocation, all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
