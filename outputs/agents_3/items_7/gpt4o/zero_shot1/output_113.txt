Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  31  15  52   7  91  79
1  38  97  14  18  94   3  63
2  61  73  56  21  77  91  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items that they value the most. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Identify the highest-valued items for each agent**: Review the valuation table and note which items have the highest value for each agent.

2. **Assign items to maximize total value**: Try to distribute items such that each agent receives some items, and the total valuation is maximized.

3. **Ensure each agent receives an item (if possible)**: Balance the allocations so that each agent receives at least one item, if feasible, given their highest valuations.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the highest with a valuation of 98, followed by item 5 with 91.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the highest with a valuation of 97, followed by item 4 with 94.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 5 and item 6 highly with valuations of 91 and 87, respectively.

Considering these values and aiming for a fair distribution, here is one possible allocation:

- Give item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation by Agent 0).
- Give item 1 to Agent 1 (highest valuation by Agent 1).
- Give item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation).
- Give item 3 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation by Agent 2).
- Give item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation).
- Give item 5 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
- Give item 6 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are assigned.
