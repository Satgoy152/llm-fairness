Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  30  68  88  66  54  44
1  31  51  90  56  90   6  20
2  11  38  78  24  30  21   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated. We will assign the items to the agents based on a simple strategy: assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's the allocation process step-by-step:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 71
   - Agent 1 values it at 31
   - Agent 2 values it at 11
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 30
   - Agent 1 values it at 51
   - Agent 2 values it at 38
   - Allocate to Agent 1

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 68
   - Agent 1 values it at 90
   - Agent 2 values it at 78
   - Allocate to Agent 1

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 88
   - Agent 1 values it at 56
   - Agent 2 values it at 24
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 66
   - Agent 1 values it at 90
   - Agent 2 values it at 30
   - Allocate to Agent 1

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 54
   - Agent 1 values it at 6
   - Agent 2 values it at 21
   - Allocate to Agent 0

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 44
   - Agent 1 values it at 20
   - Agent 2 values it at 2
   - Allocate to Agent 0

Based on the allocations above, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent's allocation is based on their highest valuations.
