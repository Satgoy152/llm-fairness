Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  66  91  98  44  96  39
1  50  46  12  88  70  91  16
2  76  96  16  45  96  27  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to assign items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair number of items.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values this the highest (98).
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values this second highest (96).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values this the highest (70).
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values this second highest (16).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values this the highest (96).
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values this second highest (76).
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values this third highest (16).

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their valuations, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
