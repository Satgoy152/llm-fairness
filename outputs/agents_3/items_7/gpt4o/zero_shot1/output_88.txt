Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  38  95   0   9  19  60
1  54  32  17  13  25  28  94
2  82  30  49  28  20  94  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing their individual satisfaction, we can use a greedy approach to assign items based on valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List all items with their valuations for each agent:**

   - Agent 0: [(30, 0), (38, 1), (95, 2), (0, 3), (9, 4), (19, 5), (60, 6)]
   - Agent 1: [(54, 0), (32, 1), (17, 2), (13, 3), (25, 4), (28, 5), (94, 6)]
   - Agent 2: [(82, 0), (30, 1), (49, 2), (28, 3), (20, 4), (94, 5), (40, 6)]

2. **Sort each agent's list of items by their valuation in descending order:**

   - Agent 0: [(95, 2), (60, 6), (38, 1), (30, 0), (19, 5), (9, 4), (0, 3)]
   - Agent 1: [(94, 6), (54, 0), (32, 1), (28, 5), (25, 4), (17, 2), (13, 3)]
   - Agent 2: [(94, 5), (82, 0), (49, 2), (40, 6), (30, 1), (28, 3), (20, 4)]

3. **Allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most and hasn't yet been assigned that item:**

   - Item 2: Agent 0 (95 is the highest valuation)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (94 is the highest valuation, Agent 0 already allocated)
   - Item 5: Agent 2 (94 is the highest valuation)
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (82 is the highest remaining valuation)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (38 is the highest remaining valuation)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (25 is the highest remaining valuation)
   - Item 3: Agent 2 (28 is the highest remaining valuation)

4. **Resulting allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [5, 0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of the items, maximizing total satisfaction based on their valuations.
