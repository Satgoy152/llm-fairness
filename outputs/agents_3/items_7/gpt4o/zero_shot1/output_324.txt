Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  33  39  46  92  63  17
1  30  58  71  43   3  23  85
2  37  67  54  20   4  92  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 58 71 43  3 23 85]
 [37 67 54 20  4 92 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will examine the valuation table and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent has approximately equal total valuation, if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (94), Item 4 (92)
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (71), Item 6 (85)
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (92), Item 1 (67)

Now, let's allocate the items based on the above high valuations:

- Assign Item 0 and Item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 and Item 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 5 and Item 1 to Agent 2.

At this point, each agent has received two items, and six items in total have been allocated, leaving one item remaining:

The remaining item is Item 3:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 3 (46), compared to Agent 1 (43) and Agent 2 (20). Therefore, we assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations.
