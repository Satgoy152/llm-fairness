Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  29  57  66  36  82  46
1  69   3  64  83  65  61  62
2  29  39  82  13  79  36  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 3 agents, we will consider the valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 0, 3, and 5.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 3, 4, and 6.
3. Agent 2 highly values items 2, 4, and 6.

Let's distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall utility:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value: 62).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value: 29).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value: 82).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value: 83).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value: 79).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value: 82).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value: 62).

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the interests of all agents based on their preferences while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
