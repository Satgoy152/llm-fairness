Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  89  82  82  61  87  86
1  79  39  38   4  68  16  36
2  63  63  22  23  80  68  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 3 agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total allocation maximizes the valuations for each agent. Let's go through the process:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: 
   - Agent 0 has high values for items 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.
   - Agent 1 has a high value for item 0.
   - Agent 2 has high values for items 4, 5, and 6.

2. **Allocate based on maximum valuations**:
   - Agent 0: Allocate items 1, 2, and 3 (values: 89, 82, 82).
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 0 (value: 79).
   - Agent 2: Allocate items 4, 5, and 6 (values: 80, 68, 71).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 7 items and respects the valuation preferences of each agent.
