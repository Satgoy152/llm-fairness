Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  81  67  41  47  25  34
1  40   1  81  90  31  99  70
2  96  72  44   2  17  45  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85 81 67 41 47 25 34]
 [40  1 81 90 31 99 70]
 [96 72 44  2 17 45 98]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent gets from their assigned items. This can be approached by considering the potential value each agent assigns to the items and ensuring each agent gets a fair share of total potential value.

Given the valuation table:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Items: 85, 81, 67, 41, 47, 25, 34

- Agent 1 values:
  - Items: 40, 1, 81, 90, 31, 99, 70

- Agent 2 values:
  - Items: 96, 72, 44, 2, 17, 45, 98

One potential allocation strategy is to prioritize items based on each agent's highest valuation, ensuring each agent receives items that they value highly.

Let's allocate items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 99).
2. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (value 98).
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (value 96).
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 81).
5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 81).
6. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 90).
7. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (value 47).

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items that they value highly, maximizing the utility for each agent while distributing all items.
