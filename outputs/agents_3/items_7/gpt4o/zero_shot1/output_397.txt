Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  17  12  56  10  31  62
1  69  25   7  58  71  27  92
2  67  66  50  32  97  40  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[73 17 12 56 10 31 62]
 [69 25  7 58 71 27 92]
 [67 66 50 32 97 40 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives approximately the same number of items. Given that there are 7 items and 3 agents, one agent will get 3 items while the other two will get 2 items each.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (73), Item 3 (56), Item 6 (62).
   - Allocate items 0 and 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (92), Item 4 (71), Item 3 (58).
   - Item 6 is already allocated, so allocate items 4 and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (97), Item 1 (66), Item 2 (50).
   - Item 4 is already allocated, so allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 2.

Now, check if all items are allocated:
- Agent 0 has items [0, 6].
- Agent 1 has items [4, 3].
- Agent 2 has items [1, 2].

There are 2 items allocated to Agent 0, 2 items to Agent 1, and 2 items to Agent 2, totaling 6 items. We need to allocate one more item.

4. Allocate the remaining item (either item 5) to the agent with the least total value from their allocated items.

- Agent 0: Total value is 73 + 62 = 135.
- Agent 1: Total value is 71 + 58 = 129.
- Agent 2: Total value is 66 + 50 = 116.

Allocate item 5 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 currently has the lowest total value.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [0, 6]
- Agent 1: [3, 4]
- Agent 2: [1, 2, 5]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
