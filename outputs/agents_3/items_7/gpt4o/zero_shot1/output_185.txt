Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  61  61  60  73  90  44
1  11  96  94  39  72  37  91
2  40  79  75  31  72   6  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 96 94 39 72 37 91]
 [40 79 75 31 72  6 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent within the constraint that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuation per agent, subject to the constraint that each item is assigned to only one agent.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 0 (value 90).
   - Next highest value items are item 5 (value 90) and item 4 (value 73).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 1 (value 96).
   - Next highest value item is item 2 (value 94).
   - Next highest value item is item 6 (value 91).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 4 (value 72).
   - Next highest value item is item 6 (value 43).

After reviewing the items, we need to ensure each item is allocated only once. Here is the allocation considering the highest valuations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

Thus, the final allocation becomes:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [5]
}
```
