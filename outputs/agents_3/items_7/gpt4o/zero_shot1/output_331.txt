Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  17  43  39  53  19  84
1  22  68  81   6  91  40  92
2  94  76   8  77  76  74  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value of items for each agent and identify the highest value item for each agent.
2. Assign the highest value item to each agent initially.
3. Allocate the remaining items considering the second highest values for each agent until all items are distributed.

Let's allocate the items according to this strategy:

- Agent 0's highest value item is item 6 (value 84).
- Agent 1's highest value item is item 6 (value 92).
- Agent 2's highest value item is item 0 (value 94).

To ensure fairness and complete allocation, let's consider the next best allocations:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 since they value it highest.
- Agent 0 receives their next highest valued item, which is item 4 (value 53).
- Agent 2 receives item 0 (value 94).
- Now, assign remaining items based on the next highest values for each agent.

Following this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: items 3 (value 39), 4 (value 53)
- Agent 1: items 1 (value 68), 6 (value 92)
- Agent 2: items 0 (value 94), 2 (value 8), 5 (value 74)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
