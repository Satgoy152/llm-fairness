Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74   4  79  86  32   9  88
1  13  76  84  25  41  93  20
2  50   5  11  77  16  78  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[74  4 79 86 32  9 88]
 [13 76 84 25 41 93 20]
 [50  5 11 77 16 78 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's highest valuations:
  - Item 6: 88
  - Item 3: 86
  - Item 2: 79
  
- Agent 1's highest valuations:
  - Item 5: 93
  - Item 2: 84
  - Item 1: 76
  
- Agent 2's highest valuations:
  - Item 6: 84
  - Item 5: 78
  - Item 3: 77

Based on these valuations, let's try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes satisfaction for each agent:

1. Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 93 for this item.
2. Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 88 for this item.
3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 77 for this item.
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 has the next highest valuation of 84 for this item.
5. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 74 for this item.
6. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 has the next highest valuation of 76 for this item.
7. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 as it is the remaining item.

Final allocations based on the above logic:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
