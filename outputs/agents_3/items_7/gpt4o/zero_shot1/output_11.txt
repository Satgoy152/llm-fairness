Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  37  21  92  65  36   6
1  72  58  36  32  67  19  47
2  69  86  89  39  66  14  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share considering their valuations. One reasonable approach is to use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [59, 37, 21, 92, 65, 36, 6]
Agent 1: [72, 58, 36, 32, 67, 19, 47]
Agent 2: [69, 86, 89, 39, 66, 14, 90]
```

A possible strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here is a possible allocation based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most at 72.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most at 86.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most at 89.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most at 92.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most at 67.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most at 36.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most at 90.

Let's ensure each agent gets at least one item, and then we can adjust if necessary to ensure fairness. Here's a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3 and 5
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 and 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 2, and 6

The allocations can be represented in the JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a share of the items, and the items are assigned to agents who value them highly.
