Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  64  12  11  81  93  83
1  39  18  58  97  99  73  65
2  88  51  29  74   7  34  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[37 64 12 11 81 93 83]
 [39 18 58 97 99 73 65]
 [88 51 29 74  7 34 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their preferences. A common approach is to use an algorithm that considers each agent's valuations and seeks to distribute the items in a way that is as equitable as possible.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [37, 64, 12, 11, 81, 93, 83]
- Agent 1 values: [39, 18, 58, 97, 99, 73, 65]
- Agent 2 values: [88, 51, 29, 74, 7, 34, 22]

We can try to allocate the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction. Let's proceed by selecting the items with the highest values for each agent while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 7.

### Allocation Strategy
1. Assign the highest valued item available to each agent.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.
3. Distribute remaining items to maximize individual agent satisfaction.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 5 (value 93), Item 4 (value 81)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (value 99) is unavailable, assign Item 3 (value 97)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (value 88), Item 3 (value unavailable), assign Item 1 (value 51)

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and we need to allocate 2 more items.

- Agent 0 receives Item 6 (value 83)
- Agent 1 receives Item 2 (value 58)

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 5, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 3, 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 6],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total satisfaction by giving each agent some of their highest valued items while ensuring that all items are distributed.
