Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  40  39  87  85  47  45
1  45  32  67  40  82   7  96
2  48  11  29  89  41  96  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. One approach is to consider the highest value each agent places on the items and try to distribute the items so that the total value is maximized for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest values: Items 3 (87), 4 (85)
   - Allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 0

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest values: Items 2 (67), 6 (96)
   - Allocate items 2 and 6 to Agent 1

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest values: Items 5 (96), 0 (48)
   - Allocate items 5 and 0 to Agent 2

Now we have allocated 6 items, so we need to allocate the remaining item:

- Item 1 is left, and Agent 0 values it the most (40), so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Now, let's allocate the items in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [5, 0]
}
```
