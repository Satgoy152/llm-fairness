Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  32  31  97  34  55  43
1  13  38  45   9  45  50  74
2  40  61  42   7  61  39  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible while ensuring each item is assigned to exactly one agent. 

Let's break down the item valuations by each agent and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**
   - Item 0: 54
   - Item 1: 32
   - Item 2: 31
   - Item 3: 97
   - Item 4: 34
   - Item 5: 55
   - Item 6: 43

2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**
   - Item 0: 13
   - Item 1: 38
   - Item 2: 45
   - Item 3: 9
   - Item 4: 45
   - Item 5: 50
   - Item 6: 74

3. **Agent 2's Valuation:**
   - Item 0: 40
   - Item 1: 61
   - Item 2: 42
   - Item 3: 7
   - Item 4: 61
   - Item 5: 39
   - Item 6: 63

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (97), so we'll assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 6 (74), so we'll assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (61) and item 4 (61), but item 1 has a unique high valuation, so we'll assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Now for distributing the remaining items:

- For item 0: Agent 0 values it at 54, which is the highest among the agents. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- For item 2: Agent 1 values it at 45, which is the highest among the agents. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- For item 4: Agent 2 values it at 61, which is the highest among the agents. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- For item 5: Agent 0 values it at 55, which is the highest among the agents. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated.
