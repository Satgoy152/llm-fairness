Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  89  19   1  11  96  85
1  33   4  82  84  79  53  44
2  64  30   4  69  55   2  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 89 19  1 11 96 85]
 [33  4 82 84 79 53 44]
 [64 30  4 69 55  2 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the valuations each agent has for the items. One common approach is to use a form of the "maximum total valuation" method, which aims to maximize the sum of each agent's valuations for the items they receive. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 5 to agent 0, as they have the highest valuation of 96.
2. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as they have the highest valuation of 82.
3. Assign item 6 to agent 2, as they have the highest valuation of 98.
4. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as they have the highest remaining valuation of 89.
5. Assign item 3 to agent 1, as they have the highest remaining valuation of 84.
6. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as they have the highest remaining valuation of 79.
7. Assign item 0 to agent 2, as they have the highest remaining valuation of 64.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [0, 6]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated, while trying to maximize the benefit for each agent based on their valuations.
