Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  33  13  99  14  29  57
1   1  76  70  67  32   2  88
2  26  48  63  23  71  40  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 1 33 13 99 14 29 57]
 [ 1 76 70 67 32  2 88]
 [26 48 63 23 71 40 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim for an allocation that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (since there are 7 items and 3 agents, at least one agent will get more than one item).

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0: [1, 33, 13, 99, 14, 29, 57]
- Agent 1: [1, 76, 70, 67, 32, 2, 88]
- Agent 2: [26, 48, 63, 23, 71, 40, 25]

A possible allocation strategy could be to assign each agent their highest valued items first and ensure that each agent gets at least two items, given the number of items (7) and agents (3).

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is 99 (item 3). Next highest is 57 (item 6).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is 88 (item 6, already taken by Agent 0), so next highest is 76 (item 1). Next highest is 70 (item 2).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is 71 (item 4). Next highest is 63 (item 2, already taken by Agent 1), so next highest is 48 (item 1, already taken by Agent 1), so next highest is 40 (item 5).

Now let's ensure each agent gets at least two items:

- Agent 0: Assign items 3 and 6.
- Agent 1: Assign items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2: Assign items 4 and 5.

Now we have allocated 6 items, so we need to allocate the last item:

- The remaining item is 0:
  - Agent 0 values it at 1.
  - Agent 1 values it at 1.
  - Agent 2 values it at 26.
  
Since Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0, allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 3 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, and the distribution is based on maximizing the valuation for each agent.
