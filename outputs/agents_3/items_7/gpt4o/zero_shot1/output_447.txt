Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  15  12   9  82  41  28
1  55  91  42  43  97  72  73
2  56  11  83  29  70  11  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 91 42 43 97 72 73]
 [56 11 83 29 70 11 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their respective valuations and ensure that each agent receives some items such that the total number of items distributed equals 7.

Here's a proposed allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 82. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - The next highest value for Agent 0 is item 5 at 41. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 97, but it's already taken by Agent 0.
   - The next highest value for Agent 1 is item 1 at 91. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 also values item 6 at 73. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 55. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 83. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 at 29. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution based on their valuations, and all 7 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 6],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
