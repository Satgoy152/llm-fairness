Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  88  38  97  20  36  86
1   1  51  84  16  16   8  66
2  42  49  81  18  67  50  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, the goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest value each agent places on any item, then allocate that item to the respective agent if it's not already allocated. This helps ensure each agent gets at least one high-value item.
2. Continue allocating items by considering which agent values the remaining items most, while ensuring no agent receives more than their fair share.

The allocations might look like this:

- Agent 0 values item 3 (97) the most.
- Agent 1 values item 2 (84) the most.
- Agent 2 values item 4 (67) the most.

Now, allocate the remaining items considering the next highest valuations:

- Agent 0 could get item 6 next (86).
- Agent 1 could get item 1 (51).
- Agent 2 could get item 5 (50).

Finally, we have item 0 left, which Agent 2 values the most (42), but Agent 0 would also benefit from it (14). Since Agent 2 has fewer items, allocate it to Agent 2.

The allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4, 5, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one high-value item they prioritized, and all items are fairly distributed.
