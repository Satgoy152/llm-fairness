Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  48  94  60  89  59  92
1  39  75  56  31  20  73  48
2  30  77  60  37  65   2  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 48 94 60 89 59 92]
 [39 75 56 31 20 73 48]
 [30 77 60 37 65  2 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. Review the valuation table:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (94), followed by item 6 (92).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (75), followed by item 5 (73).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (77), followed by item 4 (65).

2. Allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it's their highest valued item.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as it's their second-highest valued item.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it's their highest valued item.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it's their second-highest valued item.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it's their second-highest valued item.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it's one of their remaining highest valued items.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it provides a balance of allocation and maintains higher satisfaction for Agent 0.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, all items are distributed, and no agent is left without items.
