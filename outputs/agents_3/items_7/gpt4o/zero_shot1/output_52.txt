Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20   5  83  69  23  53  66
1  68  73  32  12  12  11  70
2  76  84  11  79  19   2  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [76 84 11 79 19  2 14]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here, we will try to balance the total value each agent receives by considering their valuations of the items.

Let's evaluate the items and allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 (83) and 3 (69).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 (73) and 0 (68).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 1 (84) and 3 (79).

To allocate fairly, we can do the following:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (high valuation for item 2).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (high valuation for item 3).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (high valuation for item 1).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (second-highest valuation).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (higher valuation than others).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (higher valuation than others).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (higher valuation than others).

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are of high value to them, while also distributing the total number of items fairly across the agents.
