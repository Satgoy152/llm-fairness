Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14   8  88  25  57  39  72
1  67  50  15  71  54  26  28
2  30   1  85  51   8  60  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30  1 85 51  8 60 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive each item individually.
2. Allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their total valuation.

Let's go through the process:

### Valuations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 14
  - Item 1: 8
  - Item 2: 88
  - Item 3: 25
  - Item 4: 57
  - Item 5: 39
  - Item 6: 72

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 67
  - Item 1: 50
  - Item 2: 15
  - Item 3: 71
  - Item 4: 54
  - Item 5: 26
  - Item 6: 28

- **Agent 2:**
  - Item 0: 30
  - Item 1: 1
  - Item 2: 85
  - Item 3: 51
  - Item 4: 8
  - Item 5: 60
  - Item 6: 31

### Allocation Strategy:

- We can sort the items based on the highest valuation by any agent and allocate them accordingly while ensuring fairness and balance.
  
#### Suggested Allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 2 (88)
  - Item 6 (72)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0 (67)
  - Item 3 (71)

- **Agent 2:**
  - Item 5 (60)
  - Item 4 (8)
  - Item 1 (1)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 4, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the valuations for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives at least some items.
