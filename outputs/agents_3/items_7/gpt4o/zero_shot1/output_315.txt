Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  27  25  32   6  28  10
1   0  10  19  93  44  29  27
2   1  28  66   1  23  90  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[46 27 25 32  6 28 10]
 [ 0 10 19 93 44 29 27]
 [ 1 28 66  1 23 90 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We have 7 items and 3 agents, so each agent should ideally receive at least 2 items, with one agent potentially receiving 3 items.

First, let's evaluate the values each agent places on each item:

- Agent 0: 46, 27, 25, 32, 6, 28, 10
- Agent 1: 0, 10, 19, 93, 44, 29, 27
- Agent 2: 1, 28, 66, 1, 23, 90, 21

Next, let's assign items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring fairness:

1. **Agent 1** has a very high valuation for item 3 (93). It's optimal to allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 2** values item 5 very highly (90). We allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

3. Now, consider the remaining high-value items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 0 (46), 1 (27), 2 (25)
   - Agent 1: 4 (44), 6 (27)
   - Agent 2: 2 (66), 1 (28)

4. Assign the next highest remaining value items:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (46).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (66).

5. With the remaining items and considering fairness, let's distribute:
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (44).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (27).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (21).

This assignment ensures each agent gets a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 5, 2, and 6.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 2, 6]
}
```
