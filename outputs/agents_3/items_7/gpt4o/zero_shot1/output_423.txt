Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82   1  27  99   2  98  63
1  72  51  30  23   6  93  63
2  97  36  77  87  14  62  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82  1 27 99  2 98 63]
 [72 51 30 23  6 93 63]
 [97 36 77 87 14 62 46]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - This agent highly values item 3 (99) and item 5 (98). 
   - Allocating items 3 and 5 to Agent 0 gives them a total valuation of 197.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - This agent values item 5 (93) significantly, but since item 5 is already allocated to Agent 0, weâ€™ll consider other items.
   - Item 0 has a high valuation of 72, which is decent for this agent. 
   - We allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 1, providing a total valuation of 123.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - The highest-valued items for Agent 2 are 0 (97), 3 (87), and 2 (77). However, item 0 is allocated to Agent 1 and item 3 to Agent 0.
   - We allocate items 2, 4, and 6 to Agent 2, giving them a total valuation of 137.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share of the items based on their valuations. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the three agents while considering their valuations.
