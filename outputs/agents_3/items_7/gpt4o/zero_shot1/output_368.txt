Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74   3  25  45   1  62   0
1  12  64  78  70  40  26  71
2  33  69  73  58   4  70  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 69 73 58  4 70 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated. We can use a greedy strategy to allocate the items based on the highest valuation for each item. Here's how it can be done:

1. List each item with the valuations from each agent.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 at 12, Agent 2 at 33. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 3, Agent 1 at 64, Agent 2 at 69. Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 at 78, Agent 2 at 73. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 at 70, Agent 2 at 58. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 1, Agent 1 at 40, Agent 2 at 4. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 at 26, Agent 2 at 70. Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 6:** Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 at 71, Agent 2 at 38. Assign to Agent 1.

Now we have the following allocations:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0.
- Agent 1 gets Items 2, 3, 4, and 6.
- Agent 2 gets Items 1 and 5.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
