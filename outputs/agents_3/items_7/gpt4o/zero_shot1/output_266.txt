Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  92  15  87  82  43  28
1  55  64  34  52  71  62  88
2  28  36  58  69  85  26  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[41 92 15 87 82 43 28]
 [55 64 34 52 71 62 88]
 [28 36 58 69 85 26 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a strategy where each agent gets the items that they value the most, ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items**: This helps to understand each agent's overall valuation.
2. **Allocate items based on individual item preferences**: Start by giving each agent the item they value the most, then proceed to the next highest, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 41 + 92 + 15 + 87 + 82 + 43 + 28 = 388
- Agent 1: 55 + 64 + 34 + 52 + 71 + 62 + 88 = 426
- Agent 2: 28 + 36 + 58 + 69 + 85 + 26 + 25 = 327

Now, let's allocate the items based on the highest individual valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

- **Agent 0**: Values item 1 the most at 92.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 6 the most at 88.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the most at 85.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 3: 87 (next highest for Agent 0)
  - Item 0: 41 (next highest for Agent 0)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 5: 62 (next highest for Agent 1)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 2: 58 (next highest for Agent 2)

Finally, the remaining item (item 5) can be allocated to Agent 1 as they have a high valuation for it in comparison to others.

Here is the allocation in json format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 0],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures every agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.
