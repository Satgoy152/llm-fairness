Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  99  93  10  97  22   5
1  61  44  87  17  80  27  44
2  81  19  24  28  59  56  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 44 87 17 80 27 44]
 [81 19 24 28 59 56 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. One way to approach this is by assigning items based on the highest valuation by each agent.

Let's evaluate the best allocation:

1. Agent 0's highest values:
   - Item 1 (99), Item 4 (97), Item 2 (93)

2. Agent 1's highest values:
   - Item 2 (87), Item 0 (61), Item 4 (80)

3. Agent 2's highest values:
   - Item 0 (81), Item 6 (86), Item 5 (56)

Analyzing the valuations, we can try to allocate by maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's one potential allocation:

- Assign Agent 0: Item 1 (99), Item 4 (97)
- Assign Agent 1: Item 2 (87), Item 0 (61)
- Assign Agent 2: Item 3 (28), Item 5 (56), Item 6 (86)

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: 99 + 97 = 196
- Agent 1: 87 + 61 = 148
- Agent 2: 28 + 56 + 86 = 170

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair distribution based on their valuation preferences.

Hereâ€™s the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
