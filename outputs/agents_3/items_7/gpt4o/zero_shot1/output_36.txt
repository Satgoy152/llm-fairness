Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  16  23  23  30  40  83
1  50  84  26  15   2  81  99
2   9  62  88  57   7  22  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 9 62 88 57  7 22 24]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives an approximately equal total value of items. Here's one way to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 6 and 5. Allocating item 6 (value 83) and item 5 (value 40) gives a total value of 123.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 6 and 1. However, item 6 is already allocated. We can allocate item 1 (value 84) and item 4 (value 2) for a total value of 86.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 and 3. Allocating items 2 (value 88) and 3 (value 57) results in a total value of 145.

This allocation provides a reasonable distribution of value among the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 0]
}
```

This ensures all items are allocated, and the distribution aims to balance the total value among the agents.
