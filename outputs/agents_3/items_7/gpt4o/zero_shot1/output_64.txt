Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  74   2   8  49  23  59
1   3  30  54  77   7  71  85
2  22  40  10  62  53  58  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [22 40 10 62 53 58 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation while considering a balanced distribution. Given that there are 7 items and 3 agents, we can distribute some agents 2 items and others 3 items.

We will consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive each possible combination of items.
2. Allocate items to agents to maximize their individual satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. Ensure that the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Choose items 0, 1, and 6 for a total valuation of 63 + 74 + 59 = 196.
- Agent 1: Choose items 2 and 3 for a total valuation of 54 + 77 = 131.
- Agent 2: Choose items 4 and 5 for a total valuation of 53 + 58 = 111.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least 2 items, and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
