Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  82  16  19  90  30  97
1  37  36  53  69  48  54   3
2  11  42  82  83  75  37  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [37 36 53 69 48 54  3]
 [11 42 82 83 75 37 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation of each agent's allocation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, given that the total number of items (7) can be evenly distributed among the 3 agents. Let's consider possible allocations:

1. Sort the agent valuations for each item and allocate the item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Adjust if necessary to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0:** Agent 0 has the highest valuation (94).
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 has the highest valuation (82).
- **Item 2:** Agent 2 has the highest valuation (82).
- **Item 3:** Agent 2 has the highest valuation (83).
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 has the highest valuation (90).
- **Item 5:** Agent 1 has the highest valuation (54).
- **Item 6:** Agent 0 has the highest valuation (97).

Initial allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 1, 4, 6] (4 items)
- Agent 1: [5] (1 item)
- Agent 2: [2, 3] (2 items)

Agent 1 has only one item, which is the minimum requirement. Adjustments are not necessary since each agent has at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
