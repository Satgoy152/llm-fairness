Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  96  70   1  61  42  12
1  86  67  14  30  84  99  15
2  78  27  76   5   8  80   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[50 96 70  1 61 42 12]
 [86 67 14 30 84 99 15]
 [78 27 76  5  8 80  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We will allocate items to agents such that their valuations are maximized. Here's one way to do this:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent based on their unique highest preference.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item.
3. Allocate any remaining items to maximize the overall valuation.

Let's analyze the table to determine the optimal allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (96).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (99).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the second highest (80), but since item 5 is already taken by Agent 1, we will assign the next highest valued item that is not taken, which is item 2 (76).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 3, 4, 6) to maximize overall valuation:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 1 (86) as it provides the highest valuation compared to Agents 0 (50) and 2 (78).
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 1 (30) as it provides the highest valuation compared to Agents 0 (1) and 2 (5).
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 0 (61) as it provides the highest valuation compared to Agents 1 (84) and 2 (8).
- Item 6: Assign to Agent 0 (12) as it provides the highest valuation compared to Agents 1 (15) and 2 (3).

With these considerations, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [2]
}
```
