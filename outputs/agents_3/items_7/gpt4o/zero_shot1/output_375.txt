Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  29  59  32   1  66  32
1  80  54  41  56  16   3  33
2  30  98  56  99  11  66   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 3 agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. We'll consider the following approach:

1. **Evaluate the highest value item for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 59.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 80.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 99.

2. **Assign each agent their most valued item, if possible**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Distribute remaining items**:
   - Remaining items: 1, 4, 5, 6.
   - Evaluate remaining values for each agent and try to balance the total number of items.

4. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Agent 0: Already has item 2. Consider the next highest available item: item 5.
   - Agent 1: Already has item 0. Consider the next highest available items: item 1 and item 6.
   - Agent 2: Already has item 3. Consider the next highest available item: item 4.

Following this approach:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 66).
- Assign items 1 and 6 to Agent 1 (values 54 and 33).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 11).

This gives us a fair allocation with the highest possible values for each agent, considering their remaining preferences and ensuring all items are distributed.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
