Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  15  18  97  26  82  52
1  37  66  75  84   4  72  51
2  58  43  31  20  81  59  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. This approach will involve considering the values each agent assigns to the items and distributing them accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Start by assigning items to the agents based on their highest valuations:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highest at 97.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 highest at 75.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 highest at 81.

2. Assign these items to the respective agents:
   - Agent 0 gets item 3.
   - Agent 1 gets item 2.
   - Agent 2 gets item 4.

3. Continue assigning the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations that haven't been assigned:
   - Agent 0's next highest is item 5 (82).
   - Agent 1's next highest is item 3 (84), but it's already taken. Next is item 5 (72).
   - Agent 2's next highest is item 0 (58).

4. Assign these remaining items considering availability:
   - Agent 0 also gets item 5.
   - Agent 1 gets item 1 (66) since item 5 was taken by Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 gets item 0.

5. Assign the remaining items:
   - Agent 2 can also take item 6 (11) as it’s still available.
   - Agent 1 can take item 1 as it’s their next option available.

After this process, we arrive at the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4, 0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and that all items are distributed, maximizing the values based on the agents' preferences.
