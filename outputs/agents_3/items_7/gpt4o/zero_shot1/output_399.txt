Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  19  34  16  33  49   0
1  92  83  87  76  95  34  51
2  55  85  25  57  32  46  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [92 83 87 76 95 34 51]
 [55 85 25 57 32 46 91]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's consider a simple approach where we try to assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent.

Let's review the agents' preferences:

- Agent 0: Highest valued item is 0 (83), followed by 5 (49), 2 (34), 4 (33), 1 (19), 3 (16), 6 (0).
- Agent 1: Highest valued item is 4 (95), followed by 0 (92), 2 (87), 1 (83), 3 (76), 6 (51), 5 (34).
- Agent 2: Highest valued item is 6 (91), followed by 1 (85), 3 (57), 0 (55), 5 (46), 4 (32), 2 (25).

We will aim to allocate items such that:

1. Each agent gets at least one item (if possible).
2. The total value for each agent is maximized according to their preferences.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value 95).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value 83).
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (highest value 91).
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (second-highest value 87).
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (second-highest value 49).
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (second-highest value 85).
7. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (third-highest value 76).

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4, 2, 3],
    "2": [6, 1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a fair number of items, and the allocation aims to distribute items based on maximizing the agents' valuations.
