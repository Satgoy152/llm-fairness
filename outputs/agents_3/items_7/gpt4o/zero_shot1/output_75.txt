Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  58  53   1  15   7  40
1   9  73  41  69  28  68  57
2  23  68  11  18  58  43  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to attempt to maximize the total utility (sum of valuations) for all agents, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 84
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 53
  - Item 3: 1
  - Item 4: 15
  - Item 5: 7
  - Item 6: 40

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 9
  - Item 1: 73
  - Item 2: 41
  - Item 3: 69
  - Item 4: 28
  - Item 5: 68
  - Item 6: 57

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 23
  - Item 1: 68
  - Item 2: 11
  - Item 3: 18
  - Item 4: 58
  - Item 5: 43
  - Item 6: 17

A potential allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. However, since the number of items is limited and must be distributed among all agents, we should ensure each agent receives a fair share based on the total number of items.

Let's try to assign the items optimally:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 84.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 73.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 53.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 69.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 58.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 68.
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 57.

Now, let's distribute the items to ensure a fair allocation:

- Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 3, and 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 4 and 6 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a reasonable number of items, and the total value for each agent is relatively balanced given their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
