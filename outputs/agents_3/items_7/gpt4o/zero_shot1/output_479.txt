Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  63  10  97  64   9  92
1  45  33  45  54  82  97  28
2  26  77   4  13  32   0  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 63 10 97 64  9 92]
 [45 33 45 54 82 97 28]
 [26 77  4 13 32  0 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We will use a greedy approach to assign items based on the highest value an agent has for an item. 

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 6. Assign items 0 and 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4 and 5. Assign items 4 and 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** should receive the remaining items. Assign items 1, 2, and 6 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total value of the allocation is reasonably distributed.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 6]
}
```
