Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  96  21   2   0   5  21
1   4  42  54  93  45  20  37
2  71  41  40  59  67  82  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 41 40 59 67 82 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate all the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

To achieve this, we can use a simple approach that tries to allocate items to the agents who value them the most. Let's analyze the given valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [79, 96, 21, 2, 0, 5, 21]
Agent 1: [4, 42, 54, 93, 45, 20, 37]
Agent 2: [71, 41, 40, 59, 67, 82, 16]
```

Now, let's assign items to agents based on the highest valuation:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 79.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 96.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 54.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 93.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 67.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 82.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 1 values it at 37, which is the highest remaining value.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

Based on this allocation strategy, here are the items allocated to each agent:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 6],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are fairly distributed based on the given valuations.
