Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  13  49  20  99  38  44
1  93  45   9  45   4  54  20
2  10  43  43  70  39  61  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 4 (99) and 2 (49).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuation for item 0 (93).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuation for item 3 (70).

**Step-by-step allocation:**

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 4 (highest value 99) and item 2 (second-highest value 49).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 0 (highest value 93).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3 (highest value 70).

Now, we have four items left to allocate (1, 5, 6).

Looking at the remaining items:

- **Item 1**: Best for Agent 0 (13), but not highly valued by any.
- **Item 5**: Best for Agent 2 (61).
- **Item 6**: Best for Agent 0 (44).

Allocate the remaining items:
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (best value left 61).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (best value left 44).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (since Agent 0 already has 3 items, giving Agent 1 one more item).

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the number of items given to each agent and maximize their respective valuations.
