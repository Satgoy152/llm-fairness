Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  90  33  17  74  19  52
1  27  10  78  63  45  77  17
2  29  31  61  20   5  16  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible approach:

1. Assign each agent one item they value the most.
2. Allocate the remaining items by maximizing the total value across all agents.

Let's go through the process step by step:

### Step 1: Initial Allocation
- Assign each agent one item they value the most:

  - Agent 0: Item 1 (value 90)
  - Agent 1: Item 2 (value 78)
  - Agent 2: Item 6 (value 82)

### Step 2: Allocate Remaining Items
- Remaining items: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Consider the remaining items and allocate them to maximize total value:

  - Item 0 can go to Agent 2 (value 29)
  - Item 3 can go to Agent 1 (value 63)
  - Item 4 can go to Agent 0 (value 74)
  - Item 5 can go to Agent 1 (value 77)

### Final Allocation
Let's make sure each agent has an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 7:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [6, 0]

### JSON Format
Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [6, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and maximizes the overall value received by all agents.
