Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  93  50  25  40  81  18
1  98  87  53  54  96  10  58
2  90   1  18  16  62  64  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. A common approach is to use a method that ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 1, since agent 1 values it the highest (98).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0, since agent 0 values it the highest (93).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1, since agent 1 values it the highest (53).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1, since agent 1 values it the highest (54).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1, since agent 1 values it the highest (96).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2, since agent 2 values it the highest (64).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2, since agent 2 values it the highest (31).

This ensures that each agent gets an allocation of items that maximizes their total valuation, given the constraints. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
