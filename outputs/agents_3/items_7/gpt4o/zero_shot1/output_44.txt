Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  93  73  78  83  37  53
1  80  81   7  10   7  66  27
2  61  60  74  38  36  23  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [80 81  7 10  7 66 27]
 [61 60 74 38 36 23 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives. We'll allocate the items such that the total valuation is maximized for each agent, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 and 5.
3. Agent 2 has relatively balanced valuations but might benefit from items not highly valued by others.

Based on this information, the allocation can be as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Items 5, 6
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3, 4

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.
