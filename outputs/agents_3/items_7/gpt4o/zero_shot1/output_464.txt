Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89   9  11  73  67  86  50
1  63  46  89  53  49  22  42
2  62  12  78  34  20  28  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89  9 11 73 67 86 50]
 [63 46 89 53 49 22 42]
 [62 12 78 34 20 28 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total valuation, we will use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll attempt to ensure each agent gets an approximately equal share of value.

First, let's look at the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [89, 9, 11, 73, 67, 86, 50]
- Agent 1's valuations: [63, 46, 89, 53, 49, 22, 42]
- Agent 2's valuations: [62, 12, 78, 34, 20, 28, 33]

Now, let's allocate the items while considering both fairness and the value each item brings to each agent:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 89, highest overall).
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 89, highest remaining for Agent 1).
3. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value 86, highest remaining).
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 46, highest available for Agent 1).
5. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 73, highest remaining).
6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (value 33, highest available for Agent 2).
7. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value 20, remaining item).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 3],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed to maximize the total value according to each agent's preferences.
