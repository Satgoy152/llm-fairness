Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  71  93  47  83  89  38
1  57  88  12  88  12  96  81
2  75   3  25  60  14  33  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 88 12 88 12 96 81]
 [75  3 25 60 14 33 98]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we will try to maximize the overall satisfaction or total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

Let's consider the valuations provided in the table and allocate items as follows:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as it has the highest value for agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as it has the highest value for agent 1.
3. Assign item 6 to agent 2, as it has the highest value for agent 2.
4. Assign item 5 to agent 1, as it has the next highest value for agent 1.
5. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as it has the next highest value for agent 2.
6. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as it has the next highest value for agent 0.
7. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as it has a relatively high value for agent 0.

Each agent has received at least one item, and all items have been distributed. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the values received by each agent according to the given valuations.
