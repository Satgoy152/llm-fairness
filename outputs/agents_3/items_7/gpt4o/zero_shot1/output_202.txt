Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  99  88  42   8   3  35
1  61  43  71  90  70  15  87
2  79  76  66  47  63  55  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [79 76 66 47 63 55 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a fair division approach that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One way to achieve this is by using an algorithm similar to the "maximum weighted matching" in a bipartite graph, where agents are matched to items to maximize the total valuation.

Here is the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 1 (99), 2 (88)
   - Allocate item 1 and 2 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items (excluding already allocated): 3 (90), 6 (87), 2 (71)
   - Item 2 is already allocated, so give item 3 and 6 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items (excluding already allocated): 0 (79), 1 (76), 4 (63)
   - Item 1 is already allocated, so allocate item 0 and 4 to Agent 2

This leaves item 5, which can be assigned to Agent 1 as it maximizes their remaining valuation.

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and the allocation is balanced based on the given valuations.
