Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96   8  14  43  47  15   6
1   3   9  99  90  35  42  24
2  58  90  90  58  83  62  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3  9 99 90 35 42 24]
 [58 90 90 58 83 62 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We can start by considering which agent values each item the most, and then adjust to ensure each agent receives at least one item and no items are left unallocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 96, which is the highest valuation for this item.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it at 90, which is the highest valuation for this item.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 99, which is the highest valuation for this item.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 90, which is the highest valuation for this item.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it at 83, which is the highest valuation for this item.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it at 62, which is the highest valuation for this item.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 24, which is the highest valuation for this item.

Now, we should ensure each agent gets a fair allocation and that the total number of items allocated is 7. Adjusting for this, we have:

- Agent 0: Already has item 0.
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, and 6.
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4, and 5.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3, 6],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all 7 items are allocated.
