Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  38  94   8  15  18  21
1  48   3  17  24  13  65  19
2  86  87  45  70  33  79  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 87 45 70 33 79 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, if possible.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [89, 38, 94, 8, 15, 18, 21]
- Agent 1: [48, 3, 17, 24, 13, 65, 19]
- Agent 2: [86, 87, 45, 70, 33, 79, 82]

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 0, 3, 4, 6

4. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
5. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
6. Allocate the remaining items (3 and 4) to the agents with fewer items until all items are distributed.

Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 2]
- Agent 1: [5, 3]
- Agent 2: [1, 6, 4]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1, 6, 4]
}
```
