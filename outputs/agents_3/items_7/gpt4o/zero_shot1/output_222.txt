Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99   1   9  68  77   5  69
1  59  85  98  32  63   9  96
2  80  11  18   7  20  32  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99  1  9 68 77  5 69]
 [59 85 98 32 63  9 96]
 [80 11 18  7 20 32 18]]
Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while distributing all items. Each agent should receive at least one item, which can be achieved by analyzing the valuations provided in the table.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [99, 1, 9, 68, 77, 5, 69]
- Agent 1: [59, 85, 98, 32, 63, 9, 96]
- Agent 2: [80, 11, 18, 7, 20, 32, 18]

We can follow a strategy of allocating the highest valued items to each agent, ensuring no duplication and that each agent gets items.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value: Item 0 (99)
   - Next highest: Item 6 (69)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value: Item 2 (98)
   - Next highest: Item 1 (85)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value: Item 0 (80), but already taken by Agent 0
   - Next highest: Item 5 (32)

Now, allocate remaining items to agents with lower total value:

- **Agent 2:** Assign Item 3 (7) and Item 4 (20) to balance the allocations.

Here's the final allocation for each agent:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 6
- **Agent 1:** Items 2, 1
- **Agent 2:** Items 5, 3, 4

This ensures all items are allocated with agents getting a fair share based on their highest valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [5, 3, 4]
}
```
