Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8   3  91  93  31  31  27
1  44  65  60  86  60  37  88
2  58  25  49  53  84  95  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 25 49 53 84 95 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their highest-valued items first. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3, so we allocate item 3 to them.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 6, so we allocate item 6 to them.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation compared to others for item 5, so we allocate item 5 to them.
4. For item 2, agent 0 has the highest valuation, so we allocate item 2 to them.
5. For item 4, agent 2 has the highest valuation, so we allocate item 4 to them.
6. For item 1, agent 1 has the highest valuation, so we allocate item 1 to them.
7. Lastly, for item 0, agent 2 has the highest valuation, so we allocate item 0 to them.

After these allocations, each agent has the following items:

- Agent 0: [2, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 6]
- Agent 2: [0, 4, 5]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
