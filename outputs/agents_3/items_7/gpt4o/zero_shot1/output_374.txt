Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  42  11  51  98  12  42
1  85  24  73  71  75  24  10
2  15   7  39  64  45  76   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 42 11 51 98 12 42]
 [85 24 73 71 75 24 10]
 [15  7 39 64 45 76  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 4 (value = 98)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (value = 95)
   - Total value = 98 + 95 = 193
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (value = 73)
   - Next highest: Item 3 (value = 71)
   - Total value = 73 + 71 = 144

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 5 (value = 76)
   - Next highest: Item 3 (value = 64), but it's taken, so we choose Item 4 (value = 45)
   - Total value = 76 + 45 = 121

Now, let's distribute the remaining items.

- Item 6: For Agent 0 (value = 42), Agent 1 (value = 10), Agent 2 (value = 7)
  - Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (value = 42 is highest)

- Item 1: For Agent 0 (value = 42), Agent 1 (value = 24), Agent 2 (value = 7)
  - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value = 42 is highest)

- Item 3: For Agent 0 (value = 51), Agent 1 (value = 71), Agent 2 (value = 64)
  - Since Item 3 is already assigned to Agent 1, we skip this step.

After the above allocations, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 6, 1
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Item 5

This ensures all items are fairly allocated with the consideration of maximizing individual agent values.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5]
}
```
