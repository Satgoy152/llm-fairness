Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  88  52  66  30  24  59
1  90  60  83  12  94  12  18
2  50  40  71  59  94  34  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. A common approach to achieve this is to use a method like the "Maximum Weighted Bipartite Matching" algorithm, but for simplicity, let's manually evaluate and allocate items based on the given valuations to ensure a fair distribution.

Let's examine the table for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 1: 88
  - Item 2: 52
  - Item 3: 66
  - Item 4: 30
  - Item 5: 24
  - Item 6: 59

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 60
  - Item 2: 83
  - Item 3: 12
  - Item 4: 94
  - Item 5: 12
  - Item 6: 18

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 50
  - Item 1: 40
  - Item 2: 71
  - Item 3: 59
  - Item 4: 94
  - Item 5: 34
  - Item 6: 56

Let's allocate items in a way that each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations:

- Agent 0: Allocate Item 1 (highest valuation for Agent 0) and Item 3 (second highest available after other allocations).
- Agent 1: Allocate Item 0 (highest valuation for Agent 1) and Item 4 (second highest valuation).
- Agent 2: Allocate Item 2 (highest valuation for Agent 2) and Item 6 (second highest available after other allocations).

This allocation leaves Item 5, which can be assigned to Agent 0 who has a low valuation for it but has a relatively balanced allocation compared to others.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```
