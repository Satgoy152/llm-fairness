Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  34  22  74  53  98  42
1  93  68   3  14  56   3  49
2  13   9  14  16   1  58  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can consider the following strategy: each agent tries to maximize their total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets a roughly equal share of items. Since there are 3 agents and 7 items, two agents will get 2 items each, and one agent will get 3 items.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 5 the highest (98), followed by item 3 (74). Allocating these two items gives a total valuation of 172.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 the highest (93), followed by item 1 (68), and item 4 (56). Allocating these three items provides a total valuation of 217.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 6 the highest (59), followed by item 2 (14). Allocating these two items gives a total valuation of 73.

The allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items [5, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [6, 2]

These allocations ensure that each agent gets the maximum possible valuation under the constraint of the total number of items.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [6, 2]
}
```
