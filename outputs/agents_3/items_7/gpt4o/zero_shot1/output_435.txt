Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21   2  48  31  77  30  30
1  81  64  51  21  69  13   4
2  14   9  22  69   0  76  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21  2 48 31 77 30 30]
 [81 64 51 21 69 13  4]
 [14  9 22 69  0 76 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the table, we can proceed as follows:

Agent 0:
- Values: [21, 2, 48, 31, 77, 30, 30]

Agent 1:
- Values: [81, 64, 51, 21, 69, 13, 4]

Agent 2:
- Values: [14, 9, 22, 69, 0, 76, 79]

Let's allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 81, which is the highest.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 64, which is the highest.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 48, which is the highest.
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 69, which is the highest.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 77, which is the highest.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 76, which is the highest.
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 79, which is the highest.

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.
