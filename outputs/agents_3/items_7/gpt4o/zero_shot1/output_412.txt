Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79   6  93  93  96   3  25
1  61  22  32  42  97  57  13
2  89  93  28  79  25   1   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, while ensuring every item is assigned and each agent gets an integer number of items. Below is the step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Evaluate Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [79, 6, 93, 93, 96, 3, 25]
   - Agent 1: [61, 22, 32, 42, 97, 57, 13]
   - Agent 2: [89, 93, 28, 79, 25, 1, 2]

2. **Determine Optimal Allocation:**
   - We will try to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item to keep the distribution fair.

3. **Assign Items to Agents:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it highest (89), assign to Agent 2.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it highest (93), assign to Agent 2.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it highest (93), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it highest (93), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it highest (97), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it highest (57), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it highest (25), assign to Agent 0.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items [2, 3, 6].
   - Agent 1 gets items [4, 5].
   - Agent 2 gets items [0, 1].

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
