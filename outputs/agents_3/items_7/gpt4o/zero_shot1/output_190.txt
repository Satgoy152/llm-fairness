Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  39   7   6  31  98   2
1  37  58  95  21  66  76  39
2  32  16  26  35  80  12  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll use a method that maximizes the total satisfaction across all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We can use a greedy algorithm approach where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Let's go step by step:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 28
   - Agent 1 values it at 37
   - Agent 2 values it at 32
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 39
   - Agent 1 values it at 58
   - Agent 2 values it at 16
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 7
   - Agent 1 values it at 95
   - Agent 2 values it at 26
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 6
   - Agent 1 values it at 21
   - Agent 2 values it at 35
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 31
   - Agent 1 values it at 66
   - Agent 2 values it at 80
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 98
   - Agent 1 values it at 76
   - Agent 2 values it at 12
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 2
   - Agent 1 values it at 39
   - Agent 2 values it at 32
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7.
