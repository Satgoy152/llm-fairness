Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  41  77  44  86  16  20
1  80  98  67  50   5  74  53
2   4  49  31   0  64  69  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **List Agent Valuations**: 
   - Agent 0: [89, 41, 77, 44, 86, 16, 20]
   - Agent 1: [80, 98, 67, 50, 5, 74, 53]
   - Agent 2: [4, 49, 31, 0, 64, 69, 85]

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Value**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest with 89.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest with 98.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest with 77.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the highest with 50.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it the highest with 86.
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it the highest with 69.
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it the highest with 85.

3. **Check the Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: 0, 2, 4
   - Agent 1: 1, 3
   - Agent 2: 5, 6

This distribution ensures that each agent gets a fair allocation based on their highest valuation of the items they receive. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation makes sure all items are distributed, and each agent's total valuation is considered to maintain fairness.
