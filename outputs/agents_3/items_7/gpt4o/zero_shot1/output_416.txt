Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  47  16  21  83  88  31
1  34  97  41  23  19  27  12
2  26  73  46  14  30  54  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total satisfaction or valuation each agent gets from the items they receive, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent ends up with an integer number of items. We can approach this by considering the highest valuation each agent has for available items and assigning items accordingly.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Assign items to maximize total valuation:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 4, and 5. Let's assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value among unallocated items for Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1, but it is already taken. The next highest is item 2, so assign item 2 to Agent 2.

2. **Continue assigning the remaining items:**
   - Item 0 has high valuation for Agent 0, so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Item 4 also has high value for Agent 0, so assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - For item 3, Agent 1 has the next highest valuation. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Finally, item 6 has no remaining high valuations, but Agent 0 can take it as it has a relatively higher value for Agent 0 than others.

3. **Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 5, 6
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 3
   - Agent 2: Item 2

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and the agents get them based on their highest available valuations.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
