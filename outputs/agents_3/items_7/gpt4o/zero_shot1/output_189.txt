Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  20   9  71  54  66  13
1  99  29  36  10  65   9  51
2  65  48  90  24  88  82  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. One way to approach this problem is to use a greedy algorithm where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this item at 99, which is the highest among all agents, so Agent 1 gets item 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values this item at 48, which is the highest among all agents, so Agent 2 gets item 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values this item at 90, which is the highest among all agents, so Agent 2 gets item 2.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item at 71, which is the highest among all agents, so Agent 0 gets item 3.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values this item at 88, which is the highest among all agents, so Agent 2 gets item 4.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values this item at 82, which is the highest among all agents, so Agent 2 gets item 5.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values this item at 51, which is the highest among all agents, so Agent 1 gets item 6.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on the agents' valuations, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
