Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  80  53  22  87  96  84
1  31  93  71  11  32   7  49
2  42   8  23  55  12  93  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent gets from their allocated items while ensuring that all 7 items are distributed. Here's a step-by-step reasoning to achieve this:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4, 5, and 6.
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for item 5.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items to the agent who values them the most while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items.
   - Prioritize high-value items for each agent to maximize their satisfaction.

3. **Step-by-Step Allocation:**
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 since it is the highest value item for them.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it highly.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because it's one of the highest value items for Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it highly.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0, which is another high-value item for them.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as they have a decent valuation for it and to balance the number of items.
   - Finally, assign item 0 to Agent 0 for balancing the number of items.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 0, 4, and 6.
   - Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 2 receives items 3 and 5.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
