Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  68  56  50  43  89  95
1  32  26  34  71  42  35  52
2  10  35  52  91  11   3  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable total valuation. A common approach is to maximize the overall satisfaction or fairness by attempting to balance the total value each agent receives. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** 
   - High valuations: Item 6 (95), Item 5 (89), Item 1 (68)
   - Moderate valuations: Item 2 (56), Item 3 (50), Item 4 (43), Item 0 (16)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - High valuations: Item 3 (71), Item 6 (52)
   - Moderate valuations: Item 0 (32), Item 2 (34), Item 4 (42)
   - Low valuations: Item 1 (26), Item 5 (35)

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:**
   - High valuations: Item 3 (91), Item 2 (52)
   - Moderate valuations: Item 1 (35), Item 6 (43)
   - Low valuations: Item 0 (10), Item 4 (11), Item 5 (3)

**Allocation Plan:**
- Assign items based on maximizing each agentâ€™s satisfaction with at least one high-value item per agent, if possible.

**Allocation:**
- Agent 0: Items 5, 6
  - Total valuation: 89 + 95 = 184
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
  - Total valuation: 32 + 71 = 103
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, 4
  - Total valuation: 35 + 52 + 11 = 98

This allocation provides each agent with items that offer relatively high satisfaction based on their individual valuations.
