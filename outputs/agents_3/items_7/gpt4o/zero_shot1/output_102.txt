Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  75  10  56   3  35  64
1  37  51  42   4  19  96  54
2  39  58  59  90  62   3  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items such that the allocation reflects their valuations. We can aim for a solution where each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring that all 7 items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [42, 75, 10, 56, 3, 35, 64]
- Agent 1: [37, 51, 42, 4, 19, 96, 54]
- Agent 2: [39, 58, 59, 90, 62, 3, 84]

We can take an approach to allocate items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction, while ensuring no item is left unallocated.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (75), 3 (56), and 6 (64).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (96), 6 (54), and 2 (42).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (90), 6 (84), and 4 (62).

After evaluating the preferences and aiming for a fair distribution:

- Allocate item 1 to **Agent 0**.
- Allocate item 0 to **Agent 0** (second choice based on remaining highest valuations).
- Allocate item 6 to **Agent 2** (as Agent 2 has one of the highest valuations for item 6).
- Allocate item 5 to **Agent 1** (as Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5).
- Allocate item 3 to **Agent 2** (as Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3).
- Allocate item 4 to **Agent 2**.
- Allocate item 2 to **Agent 1**.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly, and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
