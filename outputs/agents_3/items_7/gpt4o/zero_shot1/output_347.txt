Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  50  54  40  84  93  74
1  62   2  10  79  10  38  75
2  58  48  32  13  91  61  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Calculate the highest value for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest at 95.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 50.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest at 54.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the highest at 79.
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it the highest at 91.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the highest at 93.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it the highest at 75.

2. **Allocate items to agents based on the highest valuation:**

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 6.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.

3. **Verify total number of items allocated:** 
   - Agent 0 gets 4 items: 0, 1, 2, 5
   - Agent 1 gets 2 items: 3, 6
   - Agent 2 gets 1 item: 4
   - Total items allocated = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 items

4. **Final allocation in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated while attempting to maximize the total valuation for each agent.
