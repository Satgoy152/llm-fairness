Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  57  25  70  48  27  98
1  98  76  47  96  29  59  91
2  71  32  13  30  71  31   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 57 25 70 48 27 98]
 [98 76 47 96 29 59 91]
 [71 32 13 30 71 31  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. A common approach is to use the "maximum sum of valuations" to allocate items optimally. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**  
   - 0: 63, 1: 57, 2: 25, 3: 70, 4: 48, 5: 27, 6: 98

2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**  
   - 0: 98, 1: 76, 2: 47, 3: 96, 4: 29, 5: 59, 6: 91

3. **Agent 2's Valuation:**  
   - 0: 71, 1: 32, 2: 13, 3: 30, 4: 71, 5: 31, 6: 6

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (98)
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (76)
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (47)
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (70)
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (71)
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (59)
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (98)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value the most, with the highest total sum of valuations.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences and ensures all 7 items are fairly distributed.
