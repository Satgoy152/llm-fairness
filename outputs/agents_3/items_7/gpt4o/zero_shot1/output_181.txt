Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  48  65  52  79  84   9
1  80  15  77  56  74  17  79
2  64  81  73  69  57  86  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One common method for such problems is to use a greedy approach or optimization algorithms like the Hungarian method. However, given the simplicity and small size of the problem, we can manually inspect potential allocations to achieve a fair distribution.

Here's one potential allocation that considers each agent's valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 4, and 5.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 6.

Based on these observations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Allocate items 0 and 5 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Allocate items 1, 3, 4, and 6 to Agent 2.

This allocation considers the highest valuations each agent has for some items and attempts to give each agent a fair share of the total number of items.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 7 items are distributed among the agents while considering their valuations.
