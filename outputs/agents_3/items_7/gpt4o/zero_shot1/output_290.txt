Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  39  90  57  53  82  34
1  32  25  12  83  41   6  62
2  45  81   7   6  34  67  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to optimize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a reasonable allocation:

1. **Calculate the total value for each agent if they receive all items:**
   - Agent 0: 41 + 39 + 90 + 57 + 53 + 82 + 34 = 396
   - Agent 1: 32 + 25 + 12 + 83 + 41 + 6 + 62 = 261
   - Agent 2: 45 + 81 + 7 + 6 + 34 + 67 + 85 = 325

2. **Assign items based on the highest value per agent:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value 90).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value 83).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value 81).

3. **Continue assigning the remaining items to maximize individual agent value:**
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 82).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value 85).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 53).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 32).

4. **Check the allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 2, 5, 4
   - Agent 1: Items 3, 0
   - Agent 2: Items 1, 6

5. **Ensure the allocations meet the criteria:**
   - Each agent receives an integer number of items.
   - Total of 7 items allocated.

Here's the final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 4],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [1, 6]
}
```
