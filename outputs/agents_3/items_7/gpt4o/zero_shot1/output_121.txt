Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  57  98  29  99  68  59
1  45   5  26  26  77  49  93
2  65  49  71  30  72   8  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45  5 26 26 77 49 93]
 [65 49 71 30 72  8 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and the total value of items assigned to each agent is reasonably balanced. We'll use a heuristic approach to achieve this.

First, let's consider the valuation matrix:

```
Agent \ Item |  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
-----------------------------------------
      0      | 94  57  98  29  99  68  59
      1      | 45   5  26  26  77  49  93
      2      | 65  49  71  30  72   8  99
```

We will try to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is as high as possible while being fair:

1. Assign each agent the item for which they have the highest unique valuation, if possible.
2. Distribute the remaining items to balance the total value for each agent.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (99).
   - Also has high valuation for item 2 (98).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 6 (93).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 6 (99), but since agent 1 also values item 6 highly, agent 2 will take the next highest item that hasn't been assigned yet, which is item 2 (71).
   - Next highest is item 4 (72), but assigned to Agent 0. So next is item 0 (65).

Now, distribute the remaining items:

- Items remaining: 1, 3, 5

Allocate the remaining items to try and balance the distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Already has items 2 and 4.
  - Add item 1 (57) to balance.

- **Agent 1**: Already has item 6.
  - Add item 5 (49) and item 3 (26).

- **Agent 2**: Already has item 0.
  - No items left to assign.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 1],
    "1": [6, 5, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation provides a fairly balanced distribution based on the valuations provided.
