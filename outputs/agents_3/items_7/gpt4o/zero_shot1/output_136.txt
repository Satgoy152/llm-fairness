Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  80  21  75   6  67  91
1  96  47  39  16  12  71  95
2  61  59  95  58  94   4  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 80 21 75  6 67 91]
 [96 47 39 16 12 71 95]
 [61 59 95 58 94  4 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for all agents, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible, and that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Highest valuations: Item 0 (95), Item 1 (80), Item 6 (91)
- Agent 1:
  - Highest valuations: Item 0 (96), Item 6 (95), Item 5 (71)
- Agent 2:
  - Highest valuations: Item 2 (95), Item 6 (98), Item 4 (94)

Let's try to allocate items by considering their highest valuations in a way that each agent gets at least two items, and no items are left unallocated, while maximizing the total valuation.

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (value 96, highest single item value).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 80, highest valuation possible for Agent 0 after Item 0).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (value 95, highest valuation for Agent 2).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 75, next highest available for Agent 0).
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (value 94, second-highest for Agent 2).
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (value 71, second-highest for Agent 1).
7. Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (value 98, highest valuation for Agent 2, ensuring Agent 2 gets 3 items).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
