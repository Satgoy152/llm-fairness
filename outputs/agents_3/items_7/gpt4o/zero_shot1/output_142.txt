Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  50  89  66   1  31  78
1  27  46  22  80  15  82   3
2  64  34  32  23  85   3  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. This is a common approach in fair division problems, known as maximizing the Nash welfare or ensuring Pareto efficiency. Letâ€™s allocate items step-by-step considering the valuations.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 and item 2 equally at 89. We will allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it is the highest value in the table.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 as well, since it's the next highest value for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 5 at 82, which is the highest value for this agent.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
   - The next highest value for Agent 1 is item 3 at 80.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 85.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
   - The next highest value for Agent 2 is item 0, but it is already taken by Agent 0.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2, with a value of 48.

4. **Unallocated Item:**
   - Item 1 is unallocated. Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 at 46, and Agent 2 at 34.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest among the available agents.

Now, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 1],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
