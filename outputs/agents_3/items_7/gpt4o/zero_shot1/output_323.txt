Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  75  58  64  58  41  42
1  86   8  91  74  36  69  79
2  92  85  33  59  39  78  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or total valuation for each agent. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent and try to maximize it.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

After evaluating the given valuations, the following allocation maximizes the total satisfaction for each agent:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 6.
- Agent 2 receives items 4 and 5.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while maximizing their individual totals based on their valuations.
