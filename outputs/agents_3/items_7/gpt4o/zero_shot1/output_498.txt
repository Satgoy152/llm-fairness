Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  45  59  23  29   6  33
1  34  32   6  80  84  75  20
2  12  74  79  83  42   3   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 74 79 83 42  3  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will consider the highest valuations first and distribute items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 2, 1, and 6.

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 4, 3, and 5.

3. **Agent 2's Valuations**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 3, 2, and 1.

To distribute the items, let's prioritize the highest values:

- **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (value 84).
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (value 80).
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (value 75).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (value 79).
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (value 74).
- **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (value 15).
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (value 33).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 6]
- **Agent 1**: [3, 4, 5]
- **Agent 2**: [1, 2]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes the valuations based on the given priorities.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
