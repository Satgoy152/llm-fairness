Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  97  34  83  76  89  62
1  76  47  25  99  47  47  13
2  87  44   0  85  79  27  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 44  0 85 79 27 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent gets while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One approach is to evaluate the value each agent places on each item and attempt to distribute the items such that the total value is maximized for each agent.

Here is a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 shows high valuation for items 0, 1, 3 and 5.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3, but since it's already prioritized for agent 0, we will consider next highest valuations which are items 0 and 4.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0, 3, 4, and 6. Since items 0, 3, and 4 are already prioritized for other agents, we will consider items 6 and 5.

Taking into account the need for fairness and maximizing each agentâ€™s total valuation, here's one possible allocation:

- Assign items that each agent values highly, ensuring each agent gets at least two items.

### Allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 6]

This allocation aims to balance the distribution of items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least two items.

Finally, here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents while considering their valuations.
