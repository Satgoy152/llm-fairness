Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10   0  58  83  23  18  83
1  43  29  40  83  27  41   8
2  41  72  84  17  36  13  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent's satisfaction is maximized. One common method is to use a round-robin or max-min approach, ensuring that the allocations are balanced and that no agent is disproportionately dissatisfied.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest value for each agent to ensure each agent gets at least one of their highly valued items.

2. Assign items based on descending order of value for each agent.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Agent 0's highest values are for items 3 and 6 (value = 83).
- Agent 1's highest value is for item 3 (value = 83).
- Agent 2's highest value is for item 2 (value = 84).

Assign initial high-value items:
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value = 83).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value = 84).

Now proceed to assign remaining items:
- Agent 0: Next highest valued item is 6 (value = 83).
- Agent 1: Next highest valued items are 0 (value = 43) and 5 (value = 41).
- Agent 2: Next highest valued item is 1 (value = 72).

Finalize the allocation:
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, let's verify that all items are allocated:
- Agent 0: [3, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 1]

One item left unallocated, item 4:
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [3, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 1, 4]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to give each agent some of their most valued items while distributing the total number of items fairly.
