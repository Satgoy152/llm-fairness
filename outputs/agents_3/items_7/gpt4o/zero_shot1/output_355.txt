Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  49   1  65  24  41  14
1  20  72  91  80  24  70  73
2  86  37  88  48   4  32  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items with all items being allocated. We will look for a balanced distribution that considers the valuations and the total number of items.

Let's evaluate and allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations**: [17, 49, 1, 65, 24, 41, 14]
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (65), Item 1 (49)

2. **Agent 1 Valuations**: [20, 72, 91, 80, 24, 70, 73]
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (91), Item 3 (80), Item 1 (72)

3. **Agent 2 Valuations**: [86, 37, 88, 48, 4, 32, 82]
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (86), Item 2 (88), Item 6 (82)

Taking these into account, we will try to allocate items such that each agent gets high-value items relative to their preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate Item 3 (65), Item 1 (49)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate Item 2 (91), Item 5 (70)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate Item 0 (86), Item 6 (82), Item 4 (4)

Considering the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3 with valuations 49 and 65, respectively.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 5 with valuations 91 and 70, respectively.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 6, and 4 with valuations 86, 82, and 4, respectively.

This distribution ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4, 6]
}
```
