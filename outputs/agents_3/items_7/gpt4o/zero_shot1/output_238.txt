Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  39  61  30  64   6  60
1  43  93  78  23  95  74  91
2  27  75  31  52  20  93  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable distribution based on their valuations. A possible strategy is to allocate items in such a way that maximizes the total value for each agent, while ensuring that all items are assigned. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High value items: 0 (94), 4 (64), 2 (61)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - High value items: 4 (95), 6 (91), 1 (93)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - High value items: 5 (93), 1 (75)

Given these priorities, here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 (since agent 1 values it the most).
- Assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to agent 2 (as it's relatively low value for other agents).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Assign item 6 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed while taking into account the highest valuations for each agent as much as possible. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation provides a reasonable balance based on valuations, with each agent receiving some of their higher-valued items.
