Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  64  62  90  60  81  66
1  19  11  99   8  81  81  68
2  31  92  54  11  46   7  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider distributing the items in a way that maximizes the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll use a greedy approach to assign items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (90), Item 5 (81), Item 6 (66), Item 1 (64), Item 2 (62), Item 4 (60), Item 0 (31)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (99), Item 4 (81), Item 5 (81), Item 6 (68), Item 0 (19), Item 1 (11), Item 3 (8)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (92), Item 0 (31), Item 2 (54), Item 4 (46), Item 6 (30), Item 3 (11), Item 5 (7)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 3 items, and 4 more need to be allocated:

4. **Agent 0 (continue allocating to maximize their value)**:
   - Remaining high-value items: Item 5 (81), Item 6 (66), Item 4 (60), Item 2 (62), Item 1 (64), Item 0 (31)
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1 (continue allocating to maximize their value)**:
   - Remaining high-value items: Item 4 (81), Item 6 (68), Item 0 (19), Item 1 (11), Item 2 (99), Item 3 (8)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 0 (continue allocating to maximize their value)**:
   - Remaining high-value items: Item 6 (66), Item 4 (60), Item 2 (62), Item 1 (64), Item 0 (31)
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 0.

7. **Agent 2 (only remaining item)**:
   - Remaining item: Item 0
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, all items are allocated as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly among the agents based on their valuations.
