Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  91  65  60  99   4  44
1  53  63  62  81  19  25  32
2  98  58  97  70  29  74  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[26 91 65 60 99  4 44]
 [53 63 62 81 19 25 32]
 [98 58 97 70 29 74 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. This involves considering each agent's valuation for each item and distributing the items to balance the total valuation across all agents as much as possible.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 4.
2. Agent 1 can take items with moderate valuations that are not highly valued by other agents.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 6.

Based on these considerations, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 4, maximizing their high valuations.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 5, which are moderately valued by them.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 2, and 6, capitalizing on their high valuations.

Now, we'll present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 6]
}
```
