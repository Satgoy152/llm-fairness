Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  76  94  10  42  36  51
1  61  28  78  19  77  35  22
2  45  39  44  72  46  52  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 76 94 10 42 36 51]
 [61 28 78 19 77 35 22]
 [45 39 44 72 46 52 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 2 (94), 1 (76), 6 (51)
   - Allocation: Items 2, 1

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (77), 2 (78), 0 (61)
   - Allocation: Items 4, 0

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 3 (72), 5 (52), 1 (39)
   - Allocation: Items 3, 5, 6

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed fairly based on the preferences of each agent, maximizing the total valuation each receives. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

This distribution respects the constraints and preferences presented in the table.
