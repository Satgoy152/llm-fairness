Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  77  44   7  14  51  25
1  73  81  77  66  44   2  17
2  67  18   5  38  13  66  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[10 77 44  7 14 51 25]
 [73 81 77 66 44  2 17]
 [67 18  5 38 13 66 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A potential approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring no agent receives more items than another (unless unavoidable).

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [10, 77, 44, 7, 14, 51, 25]
Agent 1: [73, 81, 77, 66, 44, 2, 17]
Agent 2: [67, 18, 5, 38, 13, 66, 60]
```

We'll allocate items based on the highest value across agents for each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 73.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 81.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 77.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 66.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 at 44, Agent 2 at 13. Agent 1 values it the most.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 2 values it the most at 66.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 2 values it the most at 60.

After prioritizing based on the highest valuations, ensure an even distribution:

- Agent 1 can only take up to 4 items (since total items are 7, no agent should exceed this).
- Agent 0 and Agent 2 should get at least 1 item each.

Adjusting for balance:
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 5 and 6.
- Agent 0 gets item 4.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
