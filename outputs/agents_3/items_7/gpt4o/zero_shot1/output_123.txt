Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  11  37  57  61  58  31
1   2  45  78  96  93  41  37
2  54  80  91  92  22  46  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[11 11 37 57 61 58 31]
 [ 2 45 78 96 93 41 37]
 [54 80 91 92 22 46 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and exactly 7 items are allocated in total. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Start by identifying the highest valuation for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one high-value item.

2. **Allocate Items**:
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (value 61)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (value 96)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (value 91)

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**: Distribute the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations that haven't been allocated yet, ensuring no more than 7 items total.

4. **Finalize Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 1 (values 11, 11)
   - Agent 1: Items 5, 6 (values 41, 37)
   - Agent 2: Item 2, 3 (values 91, 92)

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [2]
}
```
Each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations, ensuring an integer number of items for each agent and exactly 7 items allocated in total.
