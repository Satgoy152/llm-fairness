Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  78  32  38  15  19  28
1  76  21  40   4  48  37  90
2  10  44  53  51   8  94  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their valuations. Let's try to distribute the items in a way that each agent gets a fair share of the items, ensuring that the total number of allocated items equals 7.

Let's evaluate the best allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Item 1 highly (78)
   - Item 3 reasonably (38)

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Item 6 highly (90)
   - Item 0 very highly (76)

3. Agent 2 values:
   - Item 5 highly (94)
   - Item 2 reasonably (53)

Based on these valuations, the allocations can be organized as follows:

- Assign Agent 0 the items they value the most: Item 1 and Item 3.
- Assign Agent 1 the items they value the most: Item 0 and Item 6.
- Assign Agent 2 the items they value the most: Item 5 and Item 2.
- Item 4 is left, and it can be reasonably assigned to Agent 1 as they value it more than Agent 0 and 2.

This allocation strategy keeps the distribution fair, considering the individual valuations and the total number of items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
