Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  40  18  29  59   6  21
1  28  56  35  70  15  45  86
2  97  41  98  25  47  58  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of total value. Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Identify highest valuations**: We should start by giving each agent the item they value the most, if possible, to maximize satisfaction.

2. **Balance the allocations**: After each agent receives one item, distribute the remaining items to balance the total value among the agents.

Let's evaluate the highest valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Highest valuation is item 4 (59)
- Agent 1: Highest valuation is item 3 (70)
- Agent 2: Highest valuation is item 2 (98)

Assign these items first:
- Agent 0 gets item 4
- Agent 1 gets item 3
- Agent 2 gets item 2

Now, let's distribute the remaining items: 0, 1, 5, 6

Assign based on remaining high valuations:
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 86 (highest remaining valuation)
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 58
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 40
- Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 97

Review the current allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 4, 1
- Agent 1: Items 3, 6
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5, 0

This ensures a fair distribution considering each agent's preferences and the constraints provided.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2, 5, 0]
}
```
