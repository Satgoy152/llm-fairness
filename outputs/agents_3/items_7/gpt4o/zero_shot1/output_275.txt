Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  92  12  91  64  81  97
1  59  35  79  75  96  28  29
2  72  26  32  17  51  19  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. We can consider the valuations each agent has for each item and distribute the items accordingly. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 6.
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 4 and 2.
   - Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 0.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign the highest valued items to agents who value them the most.
   - Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Item 1 to agent 0 (value 92).
   - Item 3 to agent 0 (value 91).
   - Item 6 to agent 0 (value 97).
   - Item 4 to agent 1 (value 96).
   - Item 2 to agent 1 (value 79).
   - Item 0 to agent 2 (value 72).
   - Item 5 to agent 2 (value 19).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the total value each agent receives is maximized based on their preferences.

4. **Final Allocations**:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint of assigning exactly 7 items and tries to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their given valuations.
