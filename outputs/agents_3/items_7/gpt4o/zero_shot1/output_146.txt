Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  79  47  42  34  21  50
1  75  79   6  89  14   0  27
2  62  38  56  61  33   9  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [75 79  6 89 14  0 27]
 [62 38 56 61 33  9 87]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and only 7 items in total are distributed.

Here is one way to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Prioritize items based on the highest value for Agent 0: Item 0 (79), Item 1 (79), Item 6 (50).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Next, allocate to Agent 1, prioritizing their highest values: Item 3 (89), Item 0 (75), Item 1 (79). Since items 0 and 1 are already taken, Agent 1 gets Item 3 (89).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Finally, allocate to Agent 2, prioritizing their highest values: Item 6 (87), Item 3 (61), Item 2 (56). Since items 6 and 3 are already taken, Agent 2 gets Item 2 (56).

Now let's adjust to ensure all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0** receives Items 0, 1, and 4 (79, 79, 34).
- **Agent 1** receives Items 3 and 5 (89, 0).
- **Agent 2** receives Items 2 and 6 (56, 87).

This allocation maximizes the total valuation each agent can obtain under the constraints. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```
