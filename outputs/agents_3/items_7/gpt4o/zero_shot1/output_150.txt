Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6
0  92  19  52  33  33  28  6
1  75  49  13  76  13   1  8
2  92  73  38  22  73  83  8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 19 52 33 33 28  6]
 [75 49 13 76 13  1  8]
 [92 73 38 22 73 83  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total value for each agent, we can use a greedy approach that assigns the items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the items. Here's how we can do it:

1. We will first list each item's value for each agent.
2. For each item, we will assign it to the agent who values it the most.
3. We ensure that each agent is considered for an integer allocation of items.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 75, Agent 2 values it at 92.
  - There is a tie between Agent 0 and Agent 2. We can assign it to either. Let's assign it to Agent 0.

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 values it at 49, Agent 2 values it at 73.
  - Agent 2 values it the most. Assign it to Agent 2.

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 52, Agent 1 values it at 13, Agent 2 values it at 38.
  - Agent 0 values it the most. Assign it to Agent 0.

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 33, Agent 1 values it at 76, Agent 2 values it at 22.
  - Agent 1 values it the most. Assign it to Agent 1.

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0 values it at 33, Agent 1 values it at 13, Agent 2 values it at 73.
  - Agent 2 values it the most. Assign it to Agent 2.

- Item 5:
  - Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 values it at 1, Agent 2 values it at 83.
  - Agent 2 values it the most. Assign it to Agent 2.

- Item 6:
  - Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 values it at 8, Agent 2 values it at 8.
  - There is a tie between Agent 1 and Agent 2. We can assign it to either. Let's assign it to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 7 items are fairly distributed among the agents.
