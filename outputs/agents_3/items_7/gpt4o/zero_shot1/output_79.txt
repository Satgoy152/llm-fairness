Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  72  13  61  60  20  32
1  89  81  38  62  37   1  62
2  46  64  12  85  30  85  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 81 38 62 37  1 62]
 [46 64 12 85 30 85 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. We can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (since there are three agents and seven items).

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (72), Item 4 (60)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (89), Item 1 (81)
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (85), Item 5 (85)

Let's distribute the items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Item 1 (72) and Item 4 (60) because they have high value for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign Item 0 (89) and Item 6 (62), which maximizes their valuation while leaving the next highest for Agent 2.
- **Agent 2**: Assign Item 3 (85) and Item 5 (85) to Agent 2, as they have high valuations for these items.
- The remaining item is Item 2. It has a low value for all, but it can be given to Agent 0 to balance the number of items.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
