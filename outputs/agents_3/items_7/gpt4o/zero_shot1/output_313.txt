Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  84  20   4  47  62  95
1  69   4  21  51  81  47   6
2  82  93  98  26  87  90  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [82 93 98 26 87 90 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has relatively high values for items 0, 1, and 6. Allocating these items to Agent 0 maximizes their total value.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 has a high value for item 4. Giving item 4 to Agent 1 maximizes their value.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 has high values for items 2, 3, and 5. Allocating these items to Agent 2 maximizes their total value.

Based on this strategy, the allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while keeping the allocation fair and within the constraints provided.
