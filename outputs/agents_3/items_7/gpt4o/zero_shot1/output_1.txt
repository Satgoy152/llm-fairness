Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  15  62  79  39   7  70
1  26  68  59  57  19   3  31
2  39  55   1  66  19  97   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[13 15 62 79 39  7 70]
 [26 68 59 57 19  3 31]
 [39 55  1 66 19 97  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuation table, we proceed as follows:

Agent 0:
- Highest value for Agent 0 is for item 3 (79)
- Second highest value for Agent 0 is for item 6 (70)

Agent 1:
- Highest value for Agent 1 is for item 1 (68)

Agent 2:
- Highest value for Agent 2 is for item 5 (97)

Now we check for remaining items and their allocations:
- Remaining items are 0, 2, and 4.

Assign remaining items based on higher valuations:
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 26, higher than others.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 62, higher than others.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 39, higher than others.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Item 5

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5]
}
```
