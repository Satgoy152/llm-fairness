Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  73  96  20  17  59  36
1  64   4   2  50  17  47  22
2  58  87   5  85   9   0  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 73 96 20 17 59 36]
 [64  4  2 50 17 47 22]
 [58 87  5 85  9  0 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated. 

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [35, 73, 96, 20, 17, 59, 36]
   - High values: Item 2 (96), Item 1 (73)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [64, 4, 2, 50, 17, 47, 22]
   - High values: Item 0 (64), Item 3 (50)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [58, 87, 5, 85, 9, 0, 31]
   - High values: Item 1 (87), Item 3 (85)

Given these preferences, a fair allocation could look like this:

- **Agent 0** gets items: 2, 5
- **Agent 1** gets items: 0, 3
- **Agent 2** gets items: 1, 4, 6

This allocation allows each agent to receive a high-valued item according to their preference and ensures all items are allocated.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```
