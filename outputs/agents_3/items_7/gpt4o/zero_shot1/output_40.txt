Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23   8  25  85  29  43  51
1   0  51  21  58  54  67  97
2  17  55   1   8  11   8  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the agents' valuations and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction. We aim to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value based on their preferences. Let's proceed with this allocation:

Agent 0 prefers items 3, 2, and 6 the most.
Agent 1 prefers items 6, 5, and 4 the most.
Agent 2 prefers items 6, 1, and 0 the most.

Let's allocate the items based on these preferences while ensuring all items are distributed:

1. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
3. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1).
4. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
6. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (third highest value for Agent 1).
7. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (second highest value for Agent 2).

The allocation looks like this:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 5, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 1]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
