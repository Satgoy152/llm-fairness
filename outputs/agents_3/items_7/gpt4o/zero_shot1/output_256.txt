Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  86   1  34  97  37  71
1  84  50  56  89   4  42  12
2  45  79  48  64  73  57  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 79 48 64 73 57 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing the total value each agent gets from their assigned items. Let's analyze the valuations and decide on the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 4 (97), Item 1 (86), Item 6 (71)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Item 0 (84), Item 3 (89), Item 2 (56)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Item 6 (89), Item 1 (79), Item 4 (73)

Let's allocate the items to maximize each agent's total valuation:

1. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (highest valuation: 97).
2. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest valuation: 84).
3. Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2 (highest valuation: 89).

Now, consider the remaining items:

- Items left: 1, 2, 3, 5

4. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation: 86).
5. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (highest remaining valuation: 89).
6. Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2 (second-highest remaining valuation: 57).

7. Finally, allocate Item 2, which has the lowest valuations across all agents, to any agent to balance the number of items. Since Agent 2 has received fewer high-value items, allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [6, 5, 2]
}
```
