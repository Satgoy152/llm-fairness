Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95   2  12  32  45  86  71
1  16  53  80  80  64  74  10
2  35   6  10   4  93  18  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95  2 12 32 45 86 71]

 [35  6 10  4 93 18 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can follow a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction. One common approach is to use a variant of the "maximum sum" allocation, which seeks to maximize the total value across all agents.

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Identify Item Values for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values: [95, 2, 12, 32, 45, 86, 71]
   - Agent 1 values: [16, 53, 80, 80, 64, 74, 10]
   - Agent 2 values: [35, 6, 10, 4, 93, 18, 27]

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Individual Valuations:**
   - Item 0: Highest value is 95 (Agent 0)
   - Item 1: Highest value is 53 (Agent 1)
   - Item 2: Highest value is 80 (Agent 1)
   - Item 3: Highest value is 80 (Agent 1)
   - Item 4: Highest value is 93 (Agent 2)
   - Item 5: Highest value is 86 (Agent 0)
   - Item 6: Highest value is 71 (Agent 0)

3. **Fair Allocation Based on Maximum Benefit:**
   - Agent 0 gets items: [0, 5, 6]
   - Agent 1 gets items: [1, 2, 3]
   - Agent 2 gets items: [4]

4. **Ensure Total Items Allocated Equals 7:**
   - Agent 0: 3 items
   - Agent 1: 3 items
   - Agent 2: 1 item

The allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations, while all 7 items are allocated.

The allocation in the required JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
