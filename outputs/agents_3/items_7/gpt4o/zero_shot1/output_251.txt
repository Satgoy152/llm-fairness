Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  20   1  51   3  37  38
1   5  30  20  61  96  61  74
2  38  12  75  13  56  43  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items distributed equals 7. Given the valuations of each agent for each item, we can make allocations as follows:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value = 19
   - Item 5: Value = 37
   - Total Value = 19 + 37 = 56

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1: Value = 30
   - Item 4: Value = 96
   - Total Value = 30 + 96 = 126

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2: Value = 75
   - Item 3: Value = 13
   - Item 6: Value = 66
   - Total Value = 75 + 13 + 66 = 154

The allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed. The agents receive the items in a way that maximizes their total perceived value. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
