Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  98  56  55  93  34   5
1  46  41  70  85  98  71  49
2  52  25  23  85  38  17  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52 25 23 85 38 17 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuations: [0, 98, 56, 55, 93, 34, 5]
   - Picks the highest value items: [98, 93, 56] (Items: 1, 4, 2)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuations: [46, 41, 70, 85, 98, 71, 49]
   - Picks the highest value items: [98, 85, 71] (Items: 4, 3, 5)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations: [52, 25, 23, 85, 38, 17, 91]
   - Picks the highest value items: [91, 85, 52] (Items: 6, 3, 0)

Given the overlap of item selections, the challenge is to ensure that each item is assigned to only one agent. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation that considers each agent's top valuations and ensures each item is allocated:

- Agent 0 gets items [1, 4]
- Agent 1 gets items [3, 5]
- Agent 2 gets items [0, 2, 6]

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 6]
}
```
