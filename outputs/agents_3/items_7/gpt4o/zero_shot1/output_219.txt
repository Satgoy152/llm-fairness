Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  72  47  31  22  81  24
1  42  39  96  17  40  74  69
2   4  49  45  59  92  12   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 72 47 31 22 81 24]
 [42 39 96 17 40 74 69]
 [ 4 49 45 59 92 12  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction for each agent based on their valuations. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations:** Item 0 (96), Item 5 (81)
2. **Agent 1's highest valuations:** Item 2 (96), Item 6 (69)
3. **Agent 2's highest valuations:** Item 4 (92), Item 3 (59)

Now, let's allocate the items based on the above considerations:

- Agent 0 is allocated Item 0 and Item 5.
- Agent 1 is allocated Item 2 and Item 6.
- Agent 2 is allocated Item 4 and Item 3.

This leaves Item 1 unallocated. Since Agent 0 values Item 1 (72) more than the other agents, we can allocate it to Agent 0.

Here's the allocation in the required format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated.
