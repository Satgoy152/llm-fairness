Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  76  69  77  82  13  73
1  18  61  60   8   1  23  76
2  42   0  96  36  46  51  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable share of items. Given there are 3 agents and 7 items, we can try to distribute the items such that no agent is left without an item.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 6.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly and has moderate valuations for items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest, followed by item 5.

Considering these valuations, a fair allocation could be:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest (96).
2. Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as they value it second-highest (76).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest (82).
4. Distribute the remaining items considering the next highest valuations:

   - Agent 0: Items 3 and 1 (valuing 77 and 76, respectively).
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (valuing 18).
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (valuing 51).

Now, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 6
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5

This maintains a fair distribution, considering each agent's preferences and ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
