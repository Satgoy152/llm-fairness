Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  54  72  74   4  64  37
1  18  69  13  90  84  37  93
2  45   3  41  66  25  52   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations. We'll try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share of the total value based on their preferences. Here's one way to approach it:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation Per Agent**: Sum the values for each agent to understand their total valuation.
2. **Determine Fair Share**: Ideally, distribute items so each agent gets a fair share of the overall value.
3. **Allocate Items**: Assign items to agents based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction while ensuring fairness.

Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation Per Agent

- **Agent 0**: 37 + 54 + 72 + 74 + 4 + 64 + 37 = 342
- **Agent 1**: 18 + 69 + 13 + 90 + 84 + 37 + 93 = 404
- **Agent 2**: 45 + 3 + 41 + 66 + 25 + 52 + 7 = 239

### Step 2: Allocate Items

We'll try to allocate items to maximize the total valuation each agent receives.

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest valuations are for items 3 (74) and 2 (72).
- **Agent 1**: 
  - Highest valuations are for items 6 (93) and 3 (90). However, 3 is already well-valued by Agent 0.
  - Next highest is item 4 (84).
- **Agent 2**: 
  - Highest valuations are for items 0 (45) and 3 (66). 
  - However, Agent 0 values item 0 at 37, which is also significant.

### Step 3: Assign Items to Each Agent

Let's assign items to each agent to maximize their satisfaction while ensuring a fair distribution:

- **Agent 0**: [2, 5]
  - Item 2 is valued at 72 and item 5 at 64. Total = 72 + 64 = 136
- **Agent 1**: [3, 4, 6]
  - Item 3 is valued at 90, item 4 at 84, and item 6 at 93. Total = 90 + 84 + 93 = 267
- **Agent 2**: [0, 1]
  - Item 0 is valued at 45 and item 1 at 3. Total = 45 + 3 = 48

### Final Allocation

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some items, maximizing their value based on their preferences. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation results in a fair distribution of items based on the agents' valuations, ensuring that all items are allocated.
