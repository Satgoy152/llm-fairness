Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  36  19   8  88  75  67
1  98  87  46  71   5  86  66
2  70  45  66  49  30  16  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 45 66 49 30 16 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives some items. One approach to achieve this is to use the "round-robin" allocation method, where each agent takes turns selecting the highest valued item available to them. Given that there are 7 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive at least 2 items (with one agent receiving an extra item).

Let's allocate the items based on the valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valued item is 0 (value 91).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valued item is 0 (value 98), but it's taken, so next is 1 (value 87).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valued item is 6 (value 82).

Now, for the second round:

1. **Agent 0:** Next highest is 4 (value 88).
2. **Agent 1:** Next highest is 5 (value 86).
3. **Agent 2:** Next highest is 2 (value 66).

Finally, for the remaining item:

1. **Agent 0:** Next highest is 5 (value 75), but it's taken, so next is 6 (value 67), but it's taken, so next is 1 (value 36), but it's taken, so next is 3 (value 8).

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6, 2]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with items in a way that respects their valuations and ensures all items are allocated.
