Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  86  27  86  23  44  48
1  64  37  89  97  83  55  37
2  53  81  19  77  35  48  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 81 19 77 35 48 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation across all agents, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We can try to allocate items based on the highest values each agent has for the remaining items until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (86), Item 3 (86)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (97), Item 2 (89)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (81), Item 3 (77)

To allocate fairly:

- Start by assigning the highest value item for each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.
- Attempt to balance the allocation by giving each agent approximately the same number of high-value items.

Using this approach:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (86)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (97)
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (48)

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (64)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (89)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (35)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (48)

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation and ensure each agent receives items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3, 0, 2],
    "2": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 3 agents fairly.
