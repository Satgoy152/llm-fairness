Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  12  18  15  42   1  49
1  60  46  88  49  69  35  95
2  58  23  76  69  67  95  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can employ an approach that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 85, Agent 1 at 60, and Agent 2 at 58. Agent 0 values it the most.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 at 46, and Agent 2 at 23. Agent 1 values it the most.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 18, Agent 1 at 88, and Agent 2 at 76. Agent 1 values it the most.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 at 49, and Agent 2 at 69. Agent 2 values it the most.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 at 69, and Agent 2 at 67. Agent 1 values it the most.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 1, Agent 1 at 35, and Agent 2 at 95. Agent 2 values it the most.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 at 95, and Agent 2 at 82. Agent 1 values it the most.

Based on these observations, we can fairly allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.
