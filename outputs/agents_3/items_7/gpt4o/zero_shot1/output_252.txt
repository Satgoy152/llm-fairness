Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  34   3  73  81  27  23
1  51  10  24  78  57  71  17
2   9  62  24  16  44  78  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[49 34  3 73 81 27 23]
 [51 10 24 78 57 71 17]
 [ 9 62 24 16 44 78 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 0, valued at 81.
   - Item 3 is also highly valued by Agent 0, valued at 73.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 5 is highly valued by Agent 1, valued at 71.
   - Item 3 is taken by Agent 0, so consider Item 0 which is valued at 51.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 5 is taken by Agent 1, so consider Item 1 which is valued at 62.
   - Item 6 is valued at 29.

Let's verify and adjust for fairness and balance:
- Agent 0: [4, 3]
- Agent 1: [5, 0]
- Agent 2: [1, 6, 2]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items. All agents have items allocated to them, maximizing their respective valuations as much as possible.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [1, 6, 2]
}
```
