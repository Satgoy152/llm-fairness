Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  22  30  19  97  82  57
1  70  35   5  79  69  71  25
2  26  14  84  83  84  77  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We need to ensure that all 7 items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations and attempt a fair distribution:

Agent 0:
- Best items based on valuation: 4 (97), 5 (82), 0 (58)

Agent 1:
- Best items based on valuation: 3 (79), 0 (70), 5 (71)

Agent 2:
- Best items based on valuation: 2 (84), 4 (84), 3 (83)

Let's allocate based on the highest valuation preference and ensure fairness:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 because it has the highest valuation (97).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 because it's the highest available (79).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 because it has the highest valuation for Agent 2 (84).
4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 because it's their second highest remaining (82).
5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 because it is their next highest valuation (70).
6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 because it's their next highest option (49).
7. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 because it's the next available and Agent 0 has fewer items.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 1],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences while distributing all 7 items.
