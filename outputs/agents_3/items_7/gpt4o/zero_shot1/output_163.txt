Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  41  96  47  69  88  95
1  48  44  93   4  42  80   3
2  94  83  49  70  33  33  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 83 49 70 33 33 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's total valuation by assigning the items based on their preferences. Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0 Preferences:**
   - Items ordered by value: 2 (96), 6 (95), 5 (88), 4 (69), 0 (51), 3 (47), 1 (41)

2. **Agent 1 Preferences:**
   - Items ordered by value: 2 (93), 5 (80), 0 (48), 1 (44), 4 (42), 3 (4), 6 (3)

3. **Agent 2 Preferences:**
   - Items ordered by value: 0 (94), 1 (83), 3 (70), 6 (70), 2 (49), 4 (33), 5 (33)

We should try to allocate the highest preferred items to each agent such that the allocation is fair. Let's try to ensure each agent gets at least one high-value item:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it is their highest value and highly valued by Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it is highly valued by them and already taken by the others.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it is their next highest after 0.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as it is their second-highest after 2.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it is highly valued by them.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it is remaining and not highly contested.

After these allocations, each agent should have a fair share based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [0, 3, 1]
}
```
