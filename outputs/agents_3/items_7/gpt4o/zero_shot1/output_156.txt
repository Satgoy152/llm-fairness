Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  76  53  67  61  79  52
1  38  64  50  63  29  35  80
2  46  85  46  97  70  96   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider distributing the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items that are most valuable to Agent 0: Item 5 (79), Item 3 (67), Item 4 (61)
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items that are most valuable to Agent 1: Item 6 (80), Item 0 (38)
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items that are most valuable to Agent 2: Item 3 (97), Item 5 (96), Item 1 (85)

Considering each agent's top preferences and ensuring that all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [3, 4]
- Agent 1: [6, 0]
- Agent 2: [5, 1, 2]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that contribute significantly to their total valuation.

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [5, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items fairly, considering the preferences of each agent.
