Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  26  21  49  43  30  69
1  81  13  69  80  63  57  49
2  39  17  14  43  65   5   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

Let's examine the valuations and make allocations:

1. Agent 0 has high value for items: 0 (98) and 6 (69).
2. Agent 1 has high value for items: 0 (81), 2 (69), and 3 (80).
3. Agent 2 has high value for items: 4 (65) and 3 (43).

We can use the following approach to allocate items fairly:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it the most.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as they have a high valuation and it's one of their top values.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it's their highest-valued item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they have the highest value for it after item 3.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as it's their next highest value.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 1 and 2 have lower values for it.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as Agent 2 has the lowest value for it.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 1],
    "1": [3, 2, 5],
    "2": [4]
}
```
