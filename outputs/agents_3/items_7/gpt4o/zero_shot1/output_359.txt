Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  42  18   6  89  86  98
1  13  80  37  12   2  90  38
2  34  65  58  82  95  39  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here’s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations**: Look for the highest valuations per item across all agents.
2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuations**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Since there are 7 items and 3 agents, some agents will naturally receive more items than others, but aim for a fair distribution based on their highest valuations.

Let’s go through each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 85 by Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 80 by Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 58 by Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 82 by Agent 2.
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 95 by Agent 2.
- **Item 5**: Highest value is 90 by Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Highest value is 98 by Agent 0.

Now, let's allocate items based on these valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 5
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 3, and 4

Each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuation preferences. The allocation is complete and fair given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
