Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  15   6  96  39  13  60
1  15  59  44  60  39  48  82
2  45  95  37  41  39  55  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [15 59 44 60 39 48 82]
 [45 95 37 41 39 55 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued item for agent 0 is item 3 with a valuation of 96. Assign this item to agent 0. Agent 0 is also interested in item 6 with a valuation of 60. Assign this item to agent 0 as well.

2. **Agent 1**: For agent 1, item 1 has the highest valuation at 59. Assign this item to agent 1. To balance the allocation, we also assign item 5 to agent 1, which has a valuation of 48.

3. **Agent 2**: For agent 2, item 4 has a valuation of 39, which is equal to the valuation for the same item by the other agents, but we assign it to agent 2 to balance the distribution of items. Additionally, assign item 0 to agent 2, which has a valuation of 45, and item 2, which has a valuation of 37.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items with a reasonably fair distribution based on their valuations.
