Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  42  75  67   1  43  81
1  81  61  68  57  53  95  15
2  55  50  93  66  38  26  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 61 68 57 53 95 15]
 [55 50 93 66 38 26 40]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction (valuation) of the agents. One common approach is to use the "max-min fairness" strategy, which seeks to maximize the minimum value that any agent receives. Let's consider the valuations provided and allocate the items in a way that tries to achieve this fairness:

Valuations:
- Agent 0: [47, 42, 75, 67, 1, 43, 81]
- Agent 1: [81, 61, 68, 57, 53, 95, 15]
- Agent 2: [55, 50, 93, 66, 38, 26, 40]

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Start by assigning the highest-valued item to each agent if possible.
2. Continue by assigning the next highest item that hasn't been assigned yet.
3. Ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent receives at least one item.

Allocation:

- Agent 0: 
  - Highest valuation: Item 6 (81)
  - Next highest available: Item 2 (75)
  - Next highest available: Item 3 (67)

- Agent 1: 
  - Highest valuation: Item 5 (95)
  - Next highest available: Item 0 (81)

- Agent 2:
  - Highest valuation: Item 2 (93) [But already assigned to Agent 0]
  - Next highest available: Item 3 (66) [But already assigned to Agent 0]
  - Next highest available: Item 1 (50)
  - Next highest available: Item 4 (38)

This ensures that each agent gets a fair share, and all items are distributed.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation balances the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed.
