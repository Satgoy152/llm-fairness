Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  87  54  89  85  14  12
1  37   1  84  75  22  86  10
2  87  23  77  93   1  74  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations of each agent for the items and attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent given the constraints. We need to assign each agent at least one item or ensure that the distribution is as equitable as possible based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values most highly: Item 0 (93), Item 3 (89), Item 1 (87)
- Agent 1 values most highly: Item 2 (84), Item 5 (86), Item 3 (75)
- Agent 2 values most highly: Item 3 (93), Item 0 (87), Item 6 (77)

A potential fair allocation strategy:

1. Assign items starting from the highest valuation, avoiding conflicts:
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 93), as it is the highest individual valuation.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (value 84), as it is the highest valuation for Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (value 93), to give Agent 2 their highest preference.

2. For the remaining items, consider the next highest valuations and attempt to distribute them fairly:
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 87), as it is the next highest for Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (value 86), as it is the next highest for Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (value 85), since Agent 0 has not been assigned any additional items yet.
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (value 77), since Agent 2 has only one item so far.

The allocations can be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
