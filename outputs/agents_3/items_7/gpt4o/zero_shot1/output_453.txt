Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  31  14   5  72  91  63
1   0  84  61  31  99  71  25
2  90  27  29  13  92  67   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[10 31 14  5 72 91 63]
 [ 0 84 61 31 99 71 25]
 [90 27 29 13 92 67  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations matrix:

```
Agent 0: [10, 31, 14, 5, 72, 91, 63]
Agent 1: [0, 84, 61, 31, 99, 71, 25]
Agent 2: [90, 27, 29, 13, 92, 67, 3]
```

We'll look at the highest valuations and attempt to assign those items to the corresponding agents, ensuring that each item is only allocated once.

1. Start by assigning items based on the highest value for each agent.
2. Ensure no item is allocated to more than one agent.
3. Adjust the allocations to ensure all items are distributed.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values this item the highest at 90.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values this item the highest at 84.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values this item the highest at 61.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values this item the highest at 31.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values this item the highest at 99.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values this item the highest at 91.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values this item the highest at 63.

The allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3, 4
- Agent 2: Item 0

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to one agent and all items are distributed. Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
