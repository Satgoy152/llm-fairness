Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  16  91   1  14  50  97
1  90  78  86  35  46  63  98
2  80  89  69   8   3  37   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a balanced share of items. One common approach is to use a variant of the "Knapsack problem" approach or simply to ensure that each agent gets at least one high-value item if possible, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's proceed:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 6 (97), Item 2 (91), Item 0 (51)
   - Allocate Item 2 (91) and Item 6 (97) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 6 (98), Item 0 (90), Item 2 (86)
   - Allocate Item 0 (90) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (89), Item 0 (80), Item 2 (69)
   - Allocate Item 1 (89) and Item 5 (37) to Agent 2.

4. We need to allocate the remaining items: Item 3, Item 4.

5. These remaining items can be allocated to balance the distribution:
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1

The final allocation based on the above strategy is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their valuations.
