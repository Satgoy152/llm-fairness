Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  52  97   7  75  23   4
1  16  81  99  67  45  92  65
2  38  42  51  30  81  48  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [38 42 51 30 81 48 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocated items equals 7.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with the highest valuations for this agent. Items 2, 0, and 4 have high values (97, 87, and 75).
2. **Agent 1**: Choose items with high valuations for this agent. Items 2, 5, and 1 have high values (99, 92, and 81).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items with the highest valuations for this agent. Items 4, 6, and 5 have high values (81, 53, and 48).

An allocation that maximizes benefits could be:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 99).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 87).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 81).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value 81).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 92).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (value 53).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 7).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7. The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the number of items each agent receives and maximize their total valuations based on the given data.
