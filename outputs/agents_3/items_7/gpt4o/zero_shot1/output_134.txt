Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  23  80   1  60  34  45
1  82  44  54  14  93  37  16
2  49  72  79   2  96  28  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 23 80  1 60 34 45]
 [82 44 54 14 93 37 16]
 [49 72 79  2 96 28 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, considering each agent should get an integer number of items and all 7 items should be allocated.

Let's go through a possible allocation process:

### Step 1: Analyze the maximum valuations per item.

- Item 0: Max value is 82 (Agent 1)
- Item 1: Max value is 72 (Agent 2)
- Item 2: Max value is 80 (Agent 0)
- Item 3: Max value is 14 (Agent 1)
- Item 4: Max value is 96 (Agent 2)
- Item 5: Max value is 37 (Agent 1)
- Item 6: Max value is 45 (Agent 0)

Now, we'll try to allocate these items to the agents based on maximizing their individual valuations.

### Step 2: Allocation based on maximum valuations.

- Agent 1 will take items 0, 3, and 5. (Values: 82, 14, 37)
- Agent 2 will take items 1 and 4. (Values: 72, 96)
- Agent 0 will take items 2 and 6. (Values: 80, 45)

### Step 3: Checking allocations.

- Agent 0: Items 2, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
