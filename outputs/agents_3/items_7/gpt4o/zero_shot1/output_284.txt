Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  45  10  55  63  56  56
1  42  71   1  21  86  57  48
2  22  86  34  22  22  14  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [22 86 34 22 22 14 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or value each agent receives from their allocations. This involves analyzing the valuations table and distributing the items in such a way that each agent gets an approximately equal share of total value.

Let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 90 + 45 + 10 + 55 + 63 + 56 + 56 = 375
- Agent 1: 42 + 71 + 1 + 21 + 86 + 57 + 48 = 326
- Agent 2: 22 + 86 + 34 + 22 + 22 + 14 + 90 = 290

Next, let's attempt to allocate items by ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value. We can prioritize giving each agent the items they value the most.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (90), Item 4 (63), Item 5 (56), Item 6 (56)
   - Allocate: Item 0, Item 5

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (86), Item 1 (71), Item 5 (57)
   - Allocate: Item 4, Item 1

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest values: Item 6 (90), Item 1 (86), Item 2 (34)
   - Allocate: Item 6, Item 2

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 5
- Agent 1 gets items 4 and 1
- Agent 2 gets items 6 and 2

Now each agent has 2 items, but we still have one item left. Let's distribute the last item (Item 3) to the agent who would value it the most among those who haven't received it:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (55)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (21)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (22)

Agent 0 values Item 3 the most, so allocate it to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 3],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [6, 2]
}
```
