Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74   0  82  34  15  78  27
1  50  69  60  61  59  86  81
2  31  24  75  30  40  15  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 69 60 61 59 86 81]
 [31 24 75 30 40 15 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent derives from the items they receive while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** prefers item 2 (value 82) and item 5 (value 78), so these are strong candidates for them.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 5 (value 86), but since item 5 is already a strong choice for Agent 0, let's consider alternatives. The next highest values for Agent 1 are item 6 (value 81) and item 1 (value 69).
3. **Agent 2** prefers item 2 (value 75), but since item 2 is already with Agent 0, we can consider item 4 (value 40) and item 6 (value 51).

Let's try the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0, 2, and 5.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 1 and 6.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 3 and 4.

This allocation considers the highest preferences possible while ensuring that each agent receives a fair allocation.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
