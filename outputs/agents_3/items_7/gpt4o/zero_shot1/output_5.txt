Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6
0  73  38  75  28  86  97  4
1  25  66  32  80  44  74  9
2  51  51  81  48   5  68  0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to consider maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and all 7 items are allocated. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Preferences**: Look at each agent's valuations for the items.
2. **Initial Allocation**: Try to assign each agent the item they value the most.
3. **Balance**: Adjust the allocations to ensure all items are distributed.

Let's go through the process:

### Step 1: Initial High-Value Allocations
- **Agent 0** values item 5 the most (97).
- **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (80).
- **Agent 2** values item 2 the most (81).

### Step 2: Allocate Remaining Items
- **Agent 0** has item 5. Second highest is item 4 (86).
- **Agent 1** has item 3. Second highest is item 1 (66).
- **Agent 2** has item 2. Second highest is item 1 (51, but already allocated).

### Step 3: Consider Fairness and Completeness
- **Agent 0**: item 0 (73).
- **Agent 1**: item 6 (9).
- **Agent 2**: item 4 (5).

### Final Allocation
Here's a possible allocation that ensures all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**: Items 5, 0
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 1, 6
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 4

### Step 4: Present in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [3, 1, 6],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
