Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1   4  93  22   8  78  21
1   1  42  27  50  45  27  32
2  35  51  67  89  51   4  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 1 42 27 50 45 27 32]
 [35 51 67 89 51  4 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations first. Let's assign items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them:

1. **Item 0**:   
   - Agent 2 values it at 35 (highest)
   
2. **Item 1**:   
   - Agent 2 values it at 51 (highest)
   
3. **Item 2**:   
   - Agent 0 values it at 93 (highest)
   
4. **Item 3**:   
   - Agent 2 values it at 89 (highest)
   
5. **Item 4**:   
   - Agent 1 values it at 45 (highest)
   
6. **Item 5**:   
   - Agent 0 values it at 78 (highest)
   
7. **Item 6**:   
   - Agent 1 values it at 32 (highest)

Now, let's check if each agent has at least one item and if the allocation is balanced:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 4, 6
- Agent 2 receives items: 0, 1, 3

This way, all items are allocated and each agent receives a fair share of items based on the highest values.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
