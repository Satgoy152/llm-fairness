Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  35  11  79  63  98  58
1  67  75  28  82  35  55  92
2  70  93  36  63  96  35  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that is as optimal as possible for each agent based on their valuations. One approach is to give each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring that each item is allocated only once.

Here are the item valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 93, 35, 11, 79, 63, 98, 58
- Agent 1: 67, 75, 28, 82, 35, 55, 92
- Agent 2: 70, 93, 36, 63, 96, 35, 41

We will use a greedy approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, one item at a time, while ensuring that no agent receives more than their fair share in terms of total items.

1. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 98.
2. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 96.
3. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 93.
4. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 93.
5. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 92.
6. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 82.
7. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 28.

By distributing these items, we ensure that each agent gets a fair allocation based on their preferences. Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format.

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [6, 3, 2],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.
