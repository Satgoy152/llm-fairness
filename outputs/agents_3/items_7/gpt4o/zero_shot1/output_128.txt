Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  21  96  24  88  97  96
1  45   7  69  40  84  22  92
2  53  73  93  57  46  29  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's utility based on their valuations. One possible approach is to use a type of envy-free allocation where we ensure each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, given the constraints.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent receives from different allocations and aim to balance these as fairly as possible.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 5, and 6.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 4, and 6.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.

Considering these observations, we can try to allocate items so that each agent gets a fairly high total valuation:

- Give items 5 and 6 to Agent 0. (Valuations: 97 + 96 = 193)
- Give items 4 and 3 to Agent 1. (Valuations: 84 + 40 = 124)
- Give items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 2. (Valuations: 53 + 73 + 93 = 219)

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed, and the allocation is made based on maximizing total values for each agent while considering fairness.
