Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  43  17  92  77  21  93
1  40  32  20  48  56  21  83
2  59  73  12  37  67  91   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [59 73 12 37 67 91  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will aim to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (total value) is balanced among the agents.

Let's analyze the table:

Agent 0's valuations: [79, 43, 17, 92, 77, 21, 93]  
Agent 1's valuations: [40, 32, 20, 48, 56, 21, 83]  
Agent 2's valuations: [59, 73, 12, 37, 67, 91, 6]  

We will pick the highest valued items for each agent to ensure fairness and maximize total value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: 93 (item 6), 92 (item 3)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: 83 (item 6), 56 (item 4)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: 91 (item 5), 73 (item 1)

We will assign the items to maximize coverage while avoiding duplicates. Since some high-value items overlap, we need to carefully distribute them:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 93 for Agent 0)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 92 for Agent 0)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 91 for Agent 2)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 73 for Agent 2)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 56 for Agent 1)

This allocation assigns 2 items to Agent 0, 1 item to Agent 1, and 2 items to Agent 2, totaling 5 items. We still need to allocate 2 more items.

Now, let's assign the remaining items (0 and 2) to further balance the allocations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 79 for Agent 0)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 20 for Agent 1)

Now, each agent has:

- Agent 0: items 6, 3, and 0
- Agent 1: items 4 and 2
- Agent 2: items 5 and 1

This allocation respects the constraints and attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3, 0],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [5, 1]
}
```
