Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  70  30  21  81   2  84
1  69  47  35   8  82  46  68
2  59  64  84  46  88   5   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[54 70 30 21 81  2 84]
 [69 47 35  8 82 46 68]
 [59 64 84 46 88  5  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

Agent 0: [54, 70, 30, 21, 81, 2, 84]
Agent 1: [69, 47, 35, 8, 82, 46, 68]
Agent 2: [59, 64, 84, 46, 88, 5, 1]

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we assign items based on the highest valuation that hasn't been allocated yet. We will also ensure that each agent receives a fair number of items.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 88. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 84. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 84. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 70. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 69. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 46, which is the highest remaining valuation. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
7. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it at 46, which is the highest remaining valuation. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [6, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 2, 3]

### JSON Representation:
```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents based on their individual valuations, maximizing the overall satisfaction.
