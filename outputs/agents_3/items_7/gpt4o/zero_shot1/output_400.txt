Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  24  62  32  41  49  88
1  65  78   8  53   5  65  55
2  87  81  67   0  65   3  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [87 81 67  0 65  3 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given there are 3 agents and 7 items, one approach is to allocate 2 items to two agents and 3 items to one agent.

Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 the most at 88, followed by item 2 at 62.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most at 78, followed by item 0 at 65.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most at 87, followed by item 1 at 81, and item 6 at 69.

We can start by assigning each agent their most valued item:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 6
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 1
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 0

Next, let's continue assigning items based on remaining high valuations and try to balance the number of items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 2 (next highest value for Agent 0)
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 (next highest value for Agent 1)
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 4 (next highest value for Agent 2)

Finally, we have one item left (item 3). Let's assign it to the agent who can still benefit from it:

- Assign item 3 to **Agent 1** (who values it at 53, which is valuable to them).

This allocation distributes the items based on each agentâ€™s preferences while balancing the number of items each agent receives.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [1, 5, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
