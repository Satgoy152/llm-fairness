Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  36  40  11  67  74  25
1  56  38   5  88  34  41  19
2  55   0  39  37   8  49  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. This involves finding a distribution of items that balances the total value received by each agent. 

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items with high individual values, but we should balance this with other agents' needs.
- Agent 1 receives items that are valuable to them, particularly item 3, which has the highest value for any item-agent pairing.
- Agent 2 receives items that maximize their individual value.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 1 should receive item 3 because it has the highest value (88).
2. Agent 2 should receive item 6 because it has the highest value for Agent 2 (99).
3. Agent 0 should receive items 0 and 5, which have high values for them (40 and 74 respectively).
4. Agent 1 should receive item 4, which offers a good value (34) to them.
5. Agent 2 should receive item 2 for a decent value (39).
6. Agent 0 should receive item 1, which also has a decent value (36) for them.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```
