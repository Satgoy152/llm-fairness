Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  26  35  19  90   4  38
1  40  78  90  31  71  87  44
2  81  28  85  35  53  91  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 28 85 35 53 91 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Given the provided valuation matrix, let's evaluate a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would get for all items and consider fair distribution:
   - Agent 0: 64, 26, 35, 19, 90, 4, 38
   - Agent 1: 40, 78, 90, 31, 71, 87, 44
   - Agent 2: 81, 28, 85, 35, 53, 91, 10

2. Consider the highest values for each agent and attempt to allocate items to maximize total satisfaction:
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (90)
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (91)
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (90)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (78)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (81)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (35)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (38)

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and each agent gets items based on their high valuation preferences.

Here's the JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 items 4 and 6, Agent 1 items 1 and 2, and Agent 2 items 0, 3, and 5.
