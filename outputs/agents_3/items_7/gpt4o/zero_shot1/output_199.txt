Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6
0  28  25  44   7  99   6  0
1  32  70  42   2  48  29  9
2  50  25  81  35  37  62  4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 25 81 35 37 62  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the minimum valuation each agent receives. This is known as the "max-min fair allocation." Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how we might allocate the items:

1. **Identify high-value items:** 
   - Look for items with high valuations that could significantly impact an agent's total valuation.

2. **Allocate strategically:**
   - Assign items to agents in a way that balances the maximum and minimum values.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated:**
   - Make sure each item is assigned to one agent, and no item is left unallocated.

Based on the given table, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 4 (99), so we assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1 (70), so we assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 2 (81), so we assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- For the remaining items, we'll try to balance the allocations while maximizing the minimum valuation:
  - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (50).
  - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (2).
  - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (62).
  - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (0).

This allocation attempts to provide a balanced distribution of items while considering the maximum valuations each agent can achieve from the available items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
