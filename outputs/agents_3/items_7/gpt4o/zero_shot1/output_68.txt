Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  49  24  30  29  24  51
1  34  18  82  58  65  84  50
2  94   6  57  67  32   4  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total utility for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's consider various allocation strategies, such as maximizing each agent's highest valued items or balancing the total value among agents. We could use a greedy algorithm or a method like the Hungarian algorithm for a more optimal solution. Here, I'll use a simple greedy approach for illustration:

1. Sort the items for each agent based on their valuations, from highest to lowest.
2. Allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once.
3. Continue until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Agent 0: Highest values for items are 80 (item 0) and 51 (item 6).
- Agent 1: Highest values for items are 84 (item 5), 82 (item 2), and 65 (item 4).
- Agent 2: Highest values for items are 94 (item 0), 67 (item 3), and 57 (item 2).

Allocate items based on highest value preference:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (value 94).
2. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 84).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 82).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (value 67).
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 49).
6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value 51).
7. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 65).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and each agent receives an integer number of items.
