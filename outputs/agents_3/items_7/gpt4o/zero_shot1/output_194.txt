Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  91  73  14  32  36  72
1   4  36  21  59  44  37  46
2  92  41  70  76   1   5  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent should receive items that maximize their valuation. Items 0, 1, and 6 have high values for agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: We can allocate items to agent 1 that maximize their valuation, considering the restrictions from the allocations to other agents. Items 3 and 4 have relatively higher values for agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent should receive items that maximize their valuation, given what remains. Items 2 and 5 have reasonable values for agent 2.

Let us allocate items according to this strategy:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
