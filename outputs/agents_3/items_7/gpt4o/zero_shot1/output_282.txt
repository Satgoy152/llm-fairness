Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  12  93   9  51  24  69
1  43  43  93  32  83  51  59
2  77  99   4  88  12  34  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 99  4 88 12 34 24]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, we can use a simple heuristic approach. We will try to assign items to agents such that each agent gets at least one item, and the overall valuation is maximized.

Let's evaluate a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (93), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the same as Agent 0, but it's already allocated. The next highest value for Agent 1 is item 4 (83), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (99), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

4. Agent 0's next highest valued item is 6 (69), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
5. Agent 1's next highest available item is either 0 or 1 (both 43), but item 1 is already taken. So, we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
6. Agent 2's next highest available item is 3 (88), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
7. The last remaining item is 5, which can be allocated to Agent 1 who values it at 51.

Now, all items are allocated and each agent has received some items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4, 0, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
