Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  34  80  64   8  85  63
1  62  27  58  41  40  26  58
2  34  20  36  86  32  67  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [34 20 36 86 32 67 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use a method such as the "maximum sum allocation" or "greedy allocation" strategy, where we iteratively allocate items to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 62.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 34.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 80.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 86.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 2.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 40.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 85.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 0.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 63.
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 0.

After these allocations, let's summarize them in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents based on their highest valuations.
