Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50   8  12  56  59  62  97
1  59  10   7  75  57  95  95
2  11   4  78  25  36  58  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring that each agent gets a fair number of items. Given that there are 7 items and 3 agents, a balanced allocation would ideally aim to give each agent 2 or 3 items.

Here is one potential allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning the item with the highest value to the agent who values it the most.
2. Continue assigning items while ensuring a balanced distribution of items among the agents.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0 has the highest value of 59 for agent 1.
- Item 1 has the highest value of 10 for agent 1.
- Item 2 has the highest value of 78 for agent 2.
- Item 3 has the highest value of 75 for agent 1.
- Item 4 has the highest value of 59 for agent 0.
- Item 5 has the highest value of 95 for agent 1.
- Item 6 has the highest value of 97 for agent 0.

Based on the values and trying to balance the allocation, a possible allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 5
- Agent 2: Item 2

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [2]
}
```
