Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  63  98  30  40  90  78
1   9  68  92   1  88  30  10
2  15  68  65  41  47  75  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We can use a simple approach to allocate the items by ensuring each agent gets a fair share considering their preferences. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Prefers item 2 (value 98), item 5 (value 90), and item 6 (value 78).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Prefers item 2 (value 92), item 4 (value 88), and item 1 (value 68).
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Prefers item 5 (value 75), item 1 (value 68), and item 4 (value 47).

Given these preferences, let's allocate by ensuring each agent gets high-value items and attempt to balance the total value each agent receives:

- **Step 1**: Start with the highest-valued items for each agent:
  - Agent 0: Allocate item 2.
  - Agent 1: Allocate item 4.
  - Agent 2: Allocate item 5.

- **Step 2**: Allocate remaining items based on remaining preferences:
  - Agent 0: Allocate item 6 (next highest value).
  - Agent 1: Allocate item 1.
  - Agent 2: Allocate item 3 (since 4 and 5 are already allocated).

Now we have allocated 6 items. The last item 0 can be allocated to balance the load or based on remaining preference:
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
