Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  29  81  82  38  30  45
1  11  30  50  59  37  40  40
2  44  52  24  52  26  81   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One way to approach this is by using a method like the "maximin share" or ensuring that the allocation is envy-free if possible. However, given the constraints, we need a heuristic approach to assign items in a manner that feels fair based on the maximum possible valuation for each agent.

Letâ€™s proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
    - Highest valuation is for item 3 (82).
    - Next highest is item 2 (81).
    - Allocate items 3 and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
    - Highest valuation is for item 3 (59), but it is already allocated.
    - Next highest is item 5 (40), then item 6 (40).
    - Allocate items 5 and 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
    - Highest valuation is for item 5 (81), but it is already allocated.
    - Next highest is item 1 (52), and item 3 (52), but item 3 is already allocated.
    - Allocate items 1 and 0 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. The remaining item is 4.

4. Final allocation to balance:
    - Item 4 has the following valuations: Agent 0 (38), Agent 1 (37), Agent 2 (26).
    - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 for a higher overall valuation.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
