Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  14   2  69  66  94  99
1  33   5  50  59  67  98  11
2  43  92   8  18  48  68  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. This is a typical problem of fair division, and one approach is to use a method that ensures each agent gets a set of items that provides them with a reasonable value relative to the others.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 6 (99), 5 (94), 3 (69)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 5 (98), 4 (67), 3 (59)
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 1 (92), 5 (68), 4 (48)

Considering the items each agent values most, we can try to allocate the items to balance the high-value preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Allocating items 0 (31), 6 (99). This gives them two items and a high total value.
- **Agent 1**: Allocating items 4 (67), 5 (98). These are among the highest values for agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocating items 1 (92), 3 (18), 2 (8). This gives them three items and a high value for item 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a reasonable number of items and values, with all items allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3, 2]
}
```
