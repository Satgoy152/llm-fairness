Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37   3  17  50  73  11  76
1  31  12  22  86   4  77  42
2  19  65  40  32  98  99  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[37  3 17 50 73 11 76]
 [31 12 22 86  4 77 42]
 [19 65 40 32 98 99 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most, at 76. 
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most, at 86.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most, at 99.

After assigning the highest valued items, we continue allocating the remaining items:

- Agent 0: After item 6, the next highest is item 4 at 73.
- Agent 1: After item 3, the next highest is item 5 at 77. (item 5 is already allocated, so let's check next)
- Agent 1: The next option is item 6 at 42, but it is allocated. So, we check item 0 at 31.
- Agent 2: After item 5, the next highest is item 4 at 98. (item 4 is already allocated, so let's check next)
- Agent 2: The next option is item 1 at 65.

Now let's finalize the allocation ensuring each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0: Allocate items [4, 6]
- Agent 1: Allocate items [0, 3]
- Agent 2: Allocate items [1, 2, 5]

Every agent has an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
