Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  95  37  88   3  46  32
1  22  41  22  32  87  62  58
2  83  14   7  95  49  56  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while also considering their valuations, we can use the method of maximizing total valuation by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. Here’s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Maximum Valuations**: For each item, identify which agent values it the most.
2. **Allocate Items**: Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
3. **Ensure Fair Distribution**: Adjust if necessary to ensure each agent receives a fair share of items.

Here’s how the allocation proceeds based on the given valuations:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most at 83.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 95.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 37.
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most at 87.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most at 62.
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 58, but the allocations need to be balanced.

After considering the allocations, it's clear that agent 1 might get too many items if we strictly go by valuations. To balance it, let's ensure an even distribution, considering the total number of items (7). We will distribute the items so each agent gets a fair share, and if necessary, slightly adjust some allocations to ensure fairness.

Here’s a revised allocation considering fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 2]
- **Agent 1**: Items [4, 5, 6]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 3]

Now, let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items according to their valuations while maintaining the total number of allocated items at 7.
