Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  83  98  75  60  32  29
1  82  90  77  58  69  61   7
2  18  71  80  92  76  51  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Assign the highest-valued items:** Start by assigning the item with the highest value to the respective agent.
2. **Continue assigning items:** Proceed to assign the next highest-valued items to the respective agents.
3. **Ensure fairness and complete allocation:** Make sure all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item if possible, while considering the total number of items matches the available items.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 2.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (second highest value).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (second highest value).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (third highest value).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (third highest value).

Thus, the allocation can be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 0, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize the total satisfaction based on the given valuations.
