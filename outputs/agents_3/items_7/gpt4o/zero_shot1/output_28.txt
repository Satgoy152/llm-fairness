Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  77  68  91  35  99  92
1  18  53  57   4  65  75  89
2  96  58  93   5  48  59  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[33 77 68 91 35 99 92]
 [18 53 57  4 65 75 89]
 [96 58 93  5 48 59 24]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations of each agent for the items. One approach is to assign items to the agents such that the total valuation for each agent is maximized, and each agent receives at least one item if possible. 

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest at 96.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest at 77.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest at 93.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest at 91.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest at 65.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest at 99.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest at 89.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some items and the overall valuation is distributed fairly based on the given data.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
