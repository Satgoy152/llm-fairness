Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  77  30  29  79  48  47
1  90  54  44  48   2  19  79
2  61  65  70  38  30  37  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 65 70 38 30 37 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we'll use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences. We'll consider each agent's valuation and try to ensure that each agent gets an optimal selection of items that maximizes their overall satisfaction.

First, let's summarize each agent's valuations for the items:

- Agent 0: [71, 77, 30, 29, 79, 48, 47]
- Agent 1: [90, 54, 44, 48, 2, 19, 79]
- Agent 2: [61, 65, 70, 38, 30, 37, 25]

We have to allocate all 7 items among the 3 agents such that each agent can receive an integer number of items. A possible approach is to initially allocate the highest-valued items for each agent, and then adjust to make sure each agent receives at least one item:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued items to ensure each agent receives a fair share.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Agent 0's highest value item is 4 (value 79).
2. Agent 1's highest value item is 0 (value 90).
3. Agent 2's highest value item is 2 (value 70).

After allocating these items, the allocation looks like this:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [2]

Now, we have 4 more items to allocate: [1, 3, 5, 6].

Next, allocate remaining items by considering the next highest values:

- Agent 0 can take item 1 (value 77).
- Agent 1 can take item 6 (value 79).
- Agent 2 can take item 3 (value 38).

This leaves us with item 5 to allocate. We'll assign it to the agent who gets the highest additional value with it:

- Agent 0: value 48
- Agent 1: value 19
- Agent 2: value 37

Item 5 is best for Agent 0.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [4, 1, 5]
- Agent 1: [0, 6]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]

This ensures all items are allocated and each agent receives a reasonable share of the items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
