Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  18  88  63   7  41  48
1  38  58  36  44  84  23  78
2  76   0  89  82  49  42   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the idea of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. A common approach is to use a method such as the "maximin" or "max sum valuation" to achieve a fair distribution. Let's consider the "max sum valuation" approach where we try to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 0, 2, and 3. However, we need to balance with other agents.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 4, 6, and 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 2, 3, and 0.

We'll try to distribute items such that each agent gets a fair share of high-value items according to their personal valuation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 2, which have high valuations (95 and 88) for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 6 and 4, which have high valuations (78 and 84) for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 3, 1, and 5, which have good valuations (82, 0, and 42) for Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a reasonable share of high-value items according to their personal valuation preferences.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [3, 1, 5]
}
```
