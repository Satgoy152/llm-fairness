Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  95  64  40  41  66  71
1  14  71  69  46  25  39  75
2  32   3  33  97  21  62  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonably fair share based on their valuations.

Let's consider a strategy where we attempt to maximize each agent's total value of the items they receive. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the items and their values for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: [19, 95, 64, 40, 41, 66, 71]
   - Agent 1: [14, 71, 69, 46, 25, 39, 75]
   - Agent 2: [32, 3, 33, 97, 21, 62, 34]

2. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 32.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 95.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 64.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 97.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 41.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 66.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 75.

3. **Adjust for a fair distribution:**
   - Initially, this gives Agent 0 five items (1, 2, 4, 5, 6), Agent 1 one item (6), and Agent 2 two items (0, 3).
   - We need to ensure each agent receives at least one item and that the distribution is as balanced as possible.

4. **Re-allocate to balance the distribution:**
   - Move item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1's second-highest valuation).
   - Move item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 2 (Agent 2's second-highest valuation).

5. **Final allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 1 receives items 4 and 6.
   - Agent 2 receives items 0, 3, and 5.

Now, let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the distribution is as fair as possible given the valuations.
