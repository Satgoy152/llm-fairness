Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  31  56  86  81  77   7
1  62  18  41  29  93  21  34
2  71   8  15  85  45  45  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 31 56 86 81 77  7]
 [62 18 41 29 93 21 34]
 [71  8 15 85 45 45 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

First, let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [94, 31, 56, 86, 81, 77, 7]
- Agent 1 values: [62, 18, 41, 29, 93, 21, 34]
- Agent 2 values: [71, 8, 15, 85, 45, 45, 62]

A possible approach is to assign each agent the item they value the most, then distribute the remaining items based on the next best options available.

1. Assign each agent the item they value highest:
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (value 94)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (value 93)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (value 85)

Now we have assigned 3 items, with items 1, 2, 5, and 6 left to allocate.

2. Allocate the remaining items:

   - Agent 0 has already received item 0. Their next highest value is item 3, but it's taken. Their next highest values are items 4 and 5, but item 4 is taken. Assign item 5 (value 77).
   - Agent 1 has already received item 4. Their next highest value is item 0, but it's taken. Their next highest values are items 1 and 6. Assign item 6 (value 34).
   - Agent 2 has already received item 3. Their next highest values are items 0, 6, and 5, but those are taken. Their next highest is item 2. Assign item 2 (value 15).
   
   Now, only item 1 remains unallocated. We consider the remaining allocations:
   - Agent 0 has items 0 and 5.
   - Agent 1 has items 4 and 6.
   - Agent 2 has items 3 and 2.

3. Assign the last item 1 to the agent with the least total value so far. Calculating the total value:
   - Agent 0: 94 + 77 = 171
   - Agent 1: 93 + 34 = 127
   - Agent 2: 85 + 15 = 100

Assign item 1 (value 8 for agent 2) to Agent 2 to balance things out.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3, 2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated, with an attempt to balance the total value received by each agent.
