Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  47  64  45  33   2  40
1  97  29  28  58  68  61  31
2  48  80  39  96  12  82  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 47 64 45 33  2 40]
 [97 29 28 58 68 61 31]
 [48 80 39 96 12 82 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7. Here is one potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the maximum value each agent assigns to any single item.
2. Assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
3. Ensure the total number of items allocated is 7.

Based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (71).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (97), but since it's already allocated, item 4 is next (68).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (96).

Continuing to allocate based on the next highest available valuations:

- Agent 0 next values item 2 (64).
- Agent 1 next values item 5 (61).
- Agent 2 next values item 6 (92).
- Agent 2 next values item 1 (80), since they have a high valuation and need more items compared to others.

This leads to the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and attempts to maximize the valuation for each agent.
