Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  53  85  12  85  74  97
1  33  41  51   7  86  17  82
2  98  57  47  58  83  19  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 41 51  7 86 17 82]
 [98 57 47 58 83 19 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items, aiming to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High valuations for items 2 (85), 4 (85), and 6 (97).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuation for item 4 (86).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations for items 0 (98), 3 (58), and 6 (60).

To ensure each agent receives at least one item and maximize their satisfaction, we can allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2 and 6
- **Agent 1**: Item 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 1, 3, and 5

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes their satisfaction based on their highest valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1, 3, 5]
}
```
