Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  48  63  63  78   7  53
1  25  76  25  31  22  40  44
2   1  88  29  98  92  25  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 48 63 63 78  7 53]
 [25 76 25 31 22 40 44]
 [ 1 88 29 98 92 25 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [25, 48, 63, 63, 78, 7, 53]
- Agent 1: [25, 76, 25, 31, 22, 40, 44]
- Agent 2: [1, 88, 29, 98, 92, 25, 29]

One approach is to allocate the items to the agent who values them the most. We can iterate through each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

1. Item 0: Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value it equally at 25, but since Agent 0 has higher other values, let's give it to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 88.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 63.
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 98.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 92.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 40.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 53.

After assigning items based on the highest valuation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 6]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 3, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated. Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
