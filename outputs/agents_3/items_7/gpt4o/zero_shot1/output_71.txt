Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  46  44  50  50  80  52
1  96  55  11  38  66   7  42
2  48  44  39  74  99  47  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s how we can approach this:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:** 
   - Agent 0: 30 + 46 + 44 + 50 + 50 + 80 + 52 = 352
   - Agent 1: 96 + 55 + 11 + 38 + 66 + 7 + 42 = 315
   - Agent 2: 48 + 44 + 39 + 74 + 99 + 47 + 78 = 429

2. **Allocate the Most Valued Items:**
   - Start by assigning the item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Allocation:**
   - Item 0: Highest value 96 by Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Highest value 55 by Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Highest value 44 by Agent 0. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Highest value 74 by Agent 2. Assign to Agent 2.
   - Item 4: Highest value 99 by Agent 2. Assign to Agent 2.
   - Item 5: Highest value 80 by Agent 0. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Highest value 78 by Agent 2. Assign to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, and all items are distributed.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 2 and 5, Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1, and Agent 2 receives items 3, 4, and 6.
