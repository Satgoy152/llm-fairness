Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  38  89  95  37  53  87
1  34  27  23  97  51  30  44
2  51  67  85  68  82  14  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [51 67 85 68 82 14 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Given the constraints, one approach is to assign items based on the highest valuations first, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 6. 
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for item 3, but Agent 0 already has item 3, so we consider other items.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 6 and 2, but Agent 0 already has item 2, so we consider other items.

Now let's assign the items:

- **Assign item 3** to Agent 0 (highest valuation among all agents).
- **Assign item 6** to Agent 2 (highest remaining valuation).
- **Assign item 2** to Agent 0 (second highest valuation for Agent 0).
- **Assign item 5** to Agent 1 (next highest unique valuation for Agent 1).
- **Assign item 4** to Agent 2 (next highest unique valuation for Agent 2).
- **Assign item 0** to Agent 0 (next highest unique valuation for Agent 0).
- **Assign item 1** to Agent 1 (remaining item for Agent 1).

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are fairly distributed among the agents.
