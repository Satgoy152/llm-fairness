Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  43  33  21  61  57   7
1  53  88  88   6  83  67  88
2  97  51  88  42  68  58  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 88 88  6 83 67 88]
 [97 51 88 42 68 58 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items to the agent who values them the most.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item**:
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest at 97.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 88.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 88.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest at 21.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest at 83.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the highest at 67.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it the highest at 88.

2. **Assign items based on the highest valuation**:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Assign items 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

3. **Review the allocations**:
   - Agent 0: 1 item (Item 3)
   - Agent 1: 5 items (Items 1, 2, 4, 5, 6)
   - Agent 2: 1 item (Item 0)

This allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent based on the items they value the most.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5, 6],
    "2": [0]
}
```
