Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  17   6  32   1  93  51
1  13  56   7  32  83  24   2
2   8  38  52  20  19  48  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to find a way to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. This often involves assigning items based on the agents' valuations in a way that attempts to maximize the minimum satisfaction (or minimize the maximum dissatisfaction).

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (93), so assign item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (83), so assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (64), so assign item 6 to agent 2.
- Next, assign the remaining items by considering each agent's next highest valued item.

Allocating the remaining items:

- Agent 0's next highest value is item 3 (32), assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1's next highest value is item 1 (56), assign item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2's next highest value is item 2 (52), assign item 2 to agent 2.
- The only remaining item is item 0, which agent 0 values the highest among the remaining options, so assign item 0 to agent 0.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives as best as possible given the constraints.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```
