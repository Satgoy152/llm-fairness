Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  22   1  49  68  85  10
1  81  42  40  37  63  77  59
2  86  49   6  44  77  89  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[28 22  1 49 68 85 10]
 [81 42 40 37 63 77 59]
 [86 49  6 44 77 89 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are distributed.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [28, 22, 1, 49, 68, 85, 10]
- Agent 1: [81, 42, 40, 37, 63, 77, 59]
- Agent 2: [86, 49, 6, 44, 77, 89, 55]

A straightforward approach is to assign each agent their highest valued items until all items are allocated. Let's proceed by selecting the highest value for each item across all agents and allocating accordingly, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

1. Item 0: Highest value is 86 (Agent 2)
2. Item 1: Highest value is 49 (Agent 2)
3. Item 2: Highest value is 40 (Agent 1)
4. Item 3: Highest value is 49 (Agent 2)
5. Item 4: Highest value is 77 (Agent 2)
6. Item 5: Highest value is 89 (Agent 2)
7. Item 6: Highest value is 59 (Agent 1)

Now, we notice that Agent 2 is getting most of the items. To ensure a fairer distribution, let's adjust and distribute based on the next highest preferences that ensure all agents get at least one item:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 1

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their preferences without any agent receiving no items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
