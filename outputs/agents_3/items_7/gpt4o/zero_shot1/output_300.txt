Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  80  11  48  31  98   0
1  84  72  49  97  27  26  64
2  60  35  44  94  75  54  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's first look at each agent's highest-valued items and try to distribute them accordingly. Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [0, 80, 11, 48, 31, 98, 0]
- Agent 1: [84, 72, 49, 97, 27, 26, 64]
- Agent 2: [60, 35, 44, 94, 75, 54, 33]

A reasonable approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations to ensure each agent receives items they value highly:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 5 (value: 98). 
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3 (value: 97).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 (value: 75).

After assigning these items, we continue allocating the remaining items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Agent 0 already has item 5 (value: 98), their next high-value item is 1 (value: 80).
- Agent 1 already has item 3 (value: 97), their next high-value item is 0 (value: 84).
- Agent 2 already has item 4 (value: 75), their next high-value item is 3, but it's already taken, so we consider item 2 (value: 44).

Continuing this process, we assign the remaining items based on the next highest values that are not already assigned:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value: 64) since Agent 0 and 2 have lower values for it.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value: 11) since Agent 1 and 2 have lower values for it.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3, 6]
- Agent 2: Item [4]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value while distributing all items fairly.
