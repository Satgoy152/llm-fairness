Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  11  18  14  92  24  49
1  79  93  16  66  69  67  86
2  58  21  82  94   4  73  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [79 93 16 66 69 67 86]
 [58 21 82 94  4 73 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations for Agent 0 are items 4 (92) and 0 (74). We allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuations for Agent 1 are items 1 (93) and 0 (79). We allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuations for Agent 2 are items 3 (94) and 2 (82). We allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. Since each agent needs to get at least one item, let's try to distribute the remaining items to maximize the fairness:

   - Agent 0: Allocate item 0 (74).
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 6 (86).
   - Agent 2: Allocate item 2 (82).
   - The remaining items are 5 and one more needs to be allocated to Agent 2 to balance the number of items:

   - Agent 2: Allocate item 5 (73).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and the total items allocated are 7. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3, 2, 5]
}
```
