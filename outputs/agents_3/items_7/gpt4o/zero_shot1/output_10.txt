Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48   6   1  18  44  47  82
1  21  37  88  53  75  88  89
2  61  10  61  22  19  92  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One way to approach this is to assign items based on the highest individual value each agent has for the items, considering the overall distribution.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 2 (88), item 5 (88), and item 6 (89). Assign items 2, 5, and 6 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 5 (92), but since item 5 is already taken, we look at other items. Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 0 (61). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

3. **Agent 0** has several moderate valuations and can be assigned the remaining items. Assign items 1, 3, and 4 to Agent 0.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.
