Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  76  42  48  25  84  75
1  15  22  59  78  55  55  48
2  60  25   0  79  77  52  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent gets from the items they receive. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 18
   - Agent 1 values it at 15
   - Agent 2 values it at 60 (highest)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 76 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 22
   - Agent 2 values it at 25
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 42
   - Agent 1 values it at 59 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 0
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 48
   - Agent 1 values it at 78 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 79 (highest)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (since both 1 and 2 have high values, choose one).

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 25
   - Agent 1 values it at 55
   - Agent 2 values it at 77 (highest)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 84 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 55
   - Agent 2 values it at 52
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 0 values it at 75
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Agent 2 values it at 55
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (highest).

Based on this allocation strategy, the final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
