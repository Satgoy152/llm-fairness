Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  85  30  79  44  98  30
1  89  55  11  56  62   6  90
2  41  39  65  43  12  79  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. This can be approached using an assignment problem strategy or by iteratively distributing items based on maximum individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives a fair share.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the value each agent places on each item.
2. Assign items iteratively to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that no agent is left without items unless necessary.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 29.
   - Agent 1 values it at 89 (highest).
   - Agent 2 values it at 41.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 85 (highest).
   - Agent 1 values it at 55.
   - Agent 2 values it at 39.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 30.
   - Agent 1 values it at 11.
   - Agent 2 values it at 65 (highest).
   - Assign to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 79 (highest).
   - Agent 1 values it at 56.
   - Agent 2 values it at 43.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 44.
   - Agent 1 values it at 62 (highest).
   - Agent 2 values it at 12.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 98 (highest).
   - Agent 1 values it at 6.
   - Agent 2 values it at 79.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 30.
   - Agent 1 values it at 90 (highest).
   - Agent 2 values it at 77.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's summarize the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [2]
}
```
