Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  74  53  13  27  42  16
1  25  20  81  88  44  56  31
2  16  92  35  28  77  45  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can allocate the items based on the highest valuation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 22
   - Agent 1 values it at 25
   - Agent 2 values it at 16
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 74
   - Agent 1 values it at 20
   - Agent 2 values it at 92
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 53
   - Agent 1 values it at 81
   - Agent 2 values it at 35
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 13
   - Agent 1 values it at 88
   - Agent 2 values it at 28
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 27
   - Agent 1 values it at 44
   - Agent 2 values it at 77
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value)

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 42
   - Agent 1 values it at 56
   - Agent 2 values it at 45
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value)

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 16
   - Agent 1 values it at 31
   - Agent 2 values it at 97
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value)

After allocating based on these values, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

Agent 0 does not receive any items as they have the lowest valuations for all items relative to the other agents. Agent 1 and Agent 2 receive the items where they have the highest valuations.
