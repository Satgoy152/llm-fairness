Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  78  66  79   6  10  12
1  20  29  33  42  63  24  21
2  77   7  34  15  84  21  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a heuristic approach that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

First, let's look at the valuations and attempt to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation is maximized:

- **Agent 0**: Prefers items 3, 1, and 2 (values: 79, 78, 66).
- **Agent 1**: Prefers items 4, 3, and 2 (values: 63, 42, 33).
- **Agent 2**: Prefers items 4, 0, and 6 (values: 84, 77, 30).

Given these preferences, we can attempt an allocation that balances the number of items each agent receives while also considering their preferences:

1. **Assign items based on highest valuations:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 79).
   - Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 63).
   - Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 77).

2. **Allocate remaining items while balancing total value and number of items:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 78).
   - Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 33).
   - Agent 2 gets item 6 (value 30).
   - Agent 2 gets item 5 (value 21).

Now, let's check the allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [3, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 2]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 6, 5]

This allocation ensures:
- Each agent receives a reasonably fair allocation based on their valuations.
- All 7 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [0, 6, 5]
}
```
