Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  23  13   7  26  13  83
1  45  81  26  20  44  78  33
2  56  20  19  26  17  27  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent and try to maximize the overall satisfaction or utility. One approach is to use a greedy method to assign items to the agents based on the highest value each agent assigns to an item. We also need to consider that each agent should receive at least one item (since there are seven items and three agents). Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**'s highest value is for item 6 (value 83).
2. **Agent 1**'s highest value is for item 1 (value 81).
3. **Agent 2**'s highest value is for item 0 (value 56).

With these initial allocations, we have:
- Agent 0: Item 6
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 0

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (2, 3, 4, 5) while considering the remaining highest values for each agent.

Continuing with the highest remaining valuations:
- **Agent 0**: Item 0 is already taken, next highest is item 4 (value 26).
- **Agent 1**: Item 5 (value 78).
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (value 26).

With these allocations, the items are distributed as follows:
- Agent 0: Items 6, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3

We have now allocated 6 items. One item (2) remains, so let's allocate it to the agent who values it the highest among those who have fewer items.

- **Agent 0** has 2 items.
- **Agent 1** has 2 items.
- **Agent 2** has 2 items.

Since all agents currently have an equal number of items, we can allocate item 2 to the agent who values it the highest:
- **Agent 0** values item 2 at 13.
- **Agent 1** values item 2 at 26.
- **Agent 2** values item 2 at 19.

Agent 1 values the remaining item 2 the highest. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [1, 5, 2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly among the agents based on their valuations.
