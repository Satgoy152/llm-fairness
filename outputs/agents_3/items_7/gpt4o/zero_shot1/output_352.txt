Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  78  16  34  45  83  83
1  79  30  63  95  98  65  57
2  91  71  14   0  74  94  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[18 78 16 34 45 83 83]
 [79 30 63 95 98 65 57]
 [91 71 14  0 74 94 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign the highest-valued items to agents who value them the most.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [18, 78, 16, 34, 45, 83, 83]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [79, 30, 63, 95, 98, 65, 57]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [91, 71, 14, 0, 74, 94, 30]

We'll try to assign items so that the overall satisfaction is maximized.

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 2 values it highest at 91.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 2.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it highest at 78.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 0.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 1 values it highest at 63.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 1.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 1 values it highest at 95.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 1.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 1 values it highest at 98.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 1.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 2 values it highest at 94.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 2.

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 0 and agent 2 both value it at 83, but agent 0 has only received one item so far, so we can assign it to agent 0 for balance.
   - Assign item 6 to agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations and that all items are allocated.
