Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  60  46  32   9  84  25
1  97  92  24  46  89  83  73
2  99   5  99  46  56  68  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[43 60 46 32  9 84 25]
 [97 92 24 46 89 83 73]
 [99  5 99 46 56 68 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method where each agent tries to maximize their total valuation based on the items they receive. We'll ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the total number of allocated items is seven. 

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (value = 84)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (value = 97)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (value = 99), but Item 0 is already taken.
   - Next highest valuation: Item 2 (value = 99)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Re-evaluate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: 1, 3, 4, 6

5. **Agent 0 (Next Best):**
   - Highest remaining valuation: Item 1 (value = 60)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1 (Next Best):**
   - Highest remaining valuation: Item 4 (value = 89)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 2 (Next Best):**
   - Highest remaining valuation: Item 3 (value = 46)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

8. **Final Allocation:**
   - Remaining item: 6
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation of the remaining item 6 (value = 73)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1.

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to one agent and all agents receive a fair distribution based on their valuations.
