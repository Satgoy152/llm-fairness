Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  49  51  18  38  47  13
1   4  70  12  37  41  73  66
2  61  95  46  52  51   8  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. A common approach to achieve this is to use a variant of the "maximum weight matching" problem, which can be solved using combinatorial optimization techniques. However, for simplicity, we'll use a heuristic method to allocate items with the aim of maximizing total value while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**: We first look at which items each agent values the most.
2. **Assign items considering fairness and maximizing value**: We allocate items to agents ensuring that each agent has a fair share of the total value.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (69), followed by item 2 (51).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (73), followed by item 1 (70).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (95), but since it's already allocated, we consider the next highest, item 3 (52).

Now, we need to make sure that all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair distribution:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

This way, each agent gets a fair allocation with an eye towards maximizing their total valuation.

Based on this approach, here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

Each agent has been assigned items in a manner that attempts to maximize their individual valuations while ensuring a fair distribution among the agents.
