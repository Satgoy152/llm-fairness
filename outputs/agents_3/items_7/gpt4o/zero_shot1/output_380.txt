Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  68  62  31  36  68  29
1  76  77  26  73  39  95  88
2  62  86  95  30  51  46  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We will proceed by examining the values each agent assigns to the items and attempt to distribute them in a way that optimizes their satisfaction.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify high-value preferences:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 1 (68) and 5 (68).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 5 (95) and 1 (77).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 2 (95) and 1 (86).

2. **Assign items to maximize personal satisfaction:**
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 95), as it's the highest preference overall.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 95), as it's their highest preference.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 68), which is a shared preference, but Agent 0 can get it without conflict now as item 5 is already assigned to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate the remaining items considering the next highest preferences:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 21), as Agent 0 has no other high-value items left and this helps balance the distribution.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 88), as Agent 1 has a high preference and it's the next best available.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 73), which they value moderately high.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 51), as it is the next best available for them.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1]
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 5, 6]
- Agent 2 receives items [2, 4]

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the satisfaction based on each agent's highest preferences while ensuring all items are distributed fairly.
