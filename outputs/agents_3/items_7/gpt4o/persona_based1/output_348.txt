Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  80  73  74  73  34  98
1  78  75  28   9  32   7  70
2  32  14  41  11  85   2  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To create a fair allocation of items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation. A typical approach to achieve this is to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 31 + 80 + 73 + 74 + 73 + 34 + 98 = 463
- Agent 1: 78 + 75 + 28 + 9 + 32 + 7 + 70 = 299
- Agent 2: 32 + 14 + 41 + 11 + 85 + 2 + 46 = 231

Calculate the proportion of the total valuation each agent has:

- Total valuation: 463 + 299 + 231 = 993

- Agent 0's share: 463 / 993 ≈ 46.6%
- Agent 1's share: 299 / 993 ≈ 30.1%
- Agent 2's share: 231 / 993 ≈ 23.3%

Based on these proportions, we should try to allocate items such that the total value received by each agent is approximately in line with these percentages, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the total value.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation percentage and should receive a significant portion of high-value items. We'll start by allocating high-value items to them.
   - Allocate item 1 (80) and item 6 (98) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** should receive items that maximize their valuation in line with their proportion.
   - Allocate item 0 (78) and item 4 (32) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** should receive items that align with their valuation proportion.
   - Allocate item 3 (11), item 2 (41), and the remaining item 5 (2) to Agent 2.

Finally, let's check if this allocation satisfies the conditions:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 6] with a total valuation of 80 + 98 = 178.
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 4] with a total valuation of 78 + 32 = 110.
- Agent 2 receives items [3, 2, 5] with a total valuation of 11 + 41 + 2 = 54.

This allocation aims to respect the proportions of total valuations each agent has while ensuring items are distributed fairly.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 2, 5]
}
```
