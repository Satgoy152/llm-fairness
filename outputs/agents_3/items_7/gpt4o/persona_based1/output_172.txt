Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  97  56  72  78  28  86
1  94  93   9  63  57  47  52
2  11  46  78  13   5   0  30
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as the best or at least equal to others based on their valuations. Let's analyze the values each agent assigns to each item and attempt a fair distribution.

Here's the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  97  56  72  78  28  86
1  94  93   9  63  57  47  52
2  11  46  78  13   5   0  30
```

A reasonable approach is to start by allocating the items that are highly valued by each agent first, and then distribute the remaining items in a manner that equalizes the utility as much as possible.

Let's consider the highest valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 highly values items 1 (97) and 0 (93).
- Agent 1 highly values items 0 (94) and 1 (93).
- Agent 2 highly values item 2 (78).

We can initially assign item 2 to agent 2 since it is most valuable to them and not as valuable to others. Then, distribute the remaining items among agents 0 and 1 while maximizing their total perceived values.

A potential allocation is:

1. Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 6 (Values: 97, 72, 86)
2. Agent 1: Items 0, 4, 5 (Values: 94, 57, 47)
3. Agent 2: Item 2 (Value: 78)

With this allocation, we ensure each agent gets items that are relatively valuable to them, trying to balance total perceived values.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": [2]
}
```
