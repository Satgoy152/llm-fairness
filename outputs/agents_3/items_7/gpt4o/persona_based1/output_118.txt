Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  70  19   0  86  29  60
1  72  84  44  51  76  43  26
2  55  87  64  85  30  26  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 70 19  0 86 29 60]
 [72 84 44 51 76 43 26]
 [55 87 64 85 30 26 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while trying to maintain envy-freeness, we can use a strategy that considers each agent's valuation of the items. A common approach is to use the "maximum marginal utility" method, where we allocate items iteratively to the agent who values the remaining items the most.

1. First, calculate each agent's total valuation for all items:
   - Agent 0: 42 + 70 + 19 + 0 + 86 + 29 + 60 = 306
   - Agent 1: 72 + 84 + 44 + 51 + 76 + 43 + 26 = 396
   - Agent 2: 55 + 87 + 64 + 85 + 30 + 26 + 75 = 422

2. Next, allocate items one by one, giving each item to the agent who values it the most at each step, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

3. A potential allocation can be as follows:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (value 72) > Agent 2 (value 55) > Agent 0 (value 42)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (value 87) > Agent 1 (value 84) > Agent 0 (value 70)
   - Item 2: Agent 2 (value 64) > Agent 1 (value 44) > Agent 0 (value 19)
   - Item 3: Agent 2 (value 85) > Agent 1 (value 51) > Agent 0 (value 0)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (value 86) > Agent 1 (value 76) > Agent 2 (value 30)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (value 43) > Agent 0 (value 29) > Agent 2 (value 26)
   - Item 6: Agent 2 (value 75) > Agent 0 (value 60) > Agent 1 (value 26)

4. Now distribute the items according to the highest valuation for each item:
   - Agent 0 receives item 4.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0 and 5.
   - Agent 2 receives items 1, 2, 3, and 6.

This allocation ensures that:
- Each agent receives an integer number of items.
- All 7 items are allocated.

The final allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
