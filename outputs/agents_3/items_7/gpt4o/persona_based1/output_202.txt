Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  90   1  71  35   7  36
1  47  77  63  23  58  18  55
2  10  47   0  37  76   0  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims for envy-freeness, we need to consider the preferences and valuations of each agent for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 90.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 77, but values item 2 the highest at 63.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 76.

A reasonable approach is to allocate high-value items to the agents that value them the most, and then distribute the remaining items to minimize envy. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Assign high-value items to agents:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 90 for Agent 0).
   - Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 63 for Agent 1).
   - Agent 2 gets item 4 (value 76 for Agent 2).

2. **Distribute remaining items:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 47 for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 71 for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 7 for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value 70 for Agent 2).

This distribution aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their own valuations, striving towards an envy-free allocation.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
