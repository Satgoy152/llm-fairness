Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  34  66  79  25  82  76
1  93  84  83  91  17  12  33
2  57  53  96  90  91  36  23
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 34 66 79 25 82 76]
 [93 84 83 91 17 12 33]
 [57 53 96 90 91 36 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents (0, 1, and 2) such that envy-freeness is achieved, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to distribute the items so that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation from their own perspective.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [92, 34, 66, 79, 25, 82, 76]
Agent 1: [93, 84, 83, 91, 17, 12, 33]
Agent 2: [57, 53, 96, 90, 91, 36, 23]
```

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0, 5, and 3 highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 0, 3, and 2 highly.
   - Agent 2 values item 2, 3, and 4 highly.

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Each Agent's Valuation:**
   - Try to give each agent their most valued items while ensuring all items are allocated.

3. **Allocate Based on Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items: 0, 5 (valued at 92, 82)
   - Agent 1 gets items: 1, 2 (valued at 84, 83)
   - Agent 2 gets items: 3, 4, 6 (valued at 90, 91, 23)

### Final Allocation

This allocation ensures each agent receives a set of items they value highly, and all items are distributed among the agents.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation intends to balance the total value received by each agent according to their valuations and ensures that all items are distributed.
