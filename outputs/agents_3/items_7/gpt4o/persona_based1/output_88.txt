Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  64  27  87  88  63  76
1  92  52  11  31  54  31  47
2  95  42  42  82  62  78   5
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive. The goal is to ensure that each agent values their set of items at least as much as they value the items allocated to any other agent, if possible.

To achieve this, we can follow a heuristic approach by looking at the valuations and attempting to allocate items to maximize individual satisfaction. This won't necessarily guarantee envy-freeness, but it aims to minimize envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (87), followed by item 4 (88). 
   - Let's allocate items 4 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - After allocating high-value items to Agent 0, we look at Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0 (92), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - For Agent 2, item 0 is already taken, but item 5 is highly valued (78). 
   - Let's allocate items 5 and 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Reallocation for balance**:
   - Now, items 1 and 6 remain unallocated.
   - Agent 0 can have item 1 (64).
   - Agent 1 can have item 6 (47).

Therefore, the allocation of items is as follows:
- Agent 0: Items 4, 3, 1
- Agent 1: Items 0, 6
- Agent 2: Items 5, 2

This allocation aims to ensure each agent receives some of the items they value highly, which can help minimize envy. Let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3, 1],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [5, 2]
}
```
