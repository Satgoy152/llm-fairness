Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  92  19   9  71  39  12
1  96  74  15  21  95   5  17
2  89  61  34  35  30  23  82
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[56 92 19  9 71 39 12]
 [96 74 15 21 95  5 17]
 [89 61 34 35 30 23 82]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, where each agent should feel that their share is at least as good as the others. We can use the valuations table provided as a basis for this allocation:

Valuations:
- Agent 0: [56, 92, 19, 9, 71, 39, 12]
- Agent 1: [96, 74, 15, 21, 95, 5, 17]
- Agent 2: [89, 61, 34, 35, 30, 23, 82]

We will attempt to allocate the items such that the total value perceived by each agent is roughly balanced.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify the most valued items for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 (92) and item 4 (71) highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 (96) and item 4 (95) highly.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 (89) and item 6 (82) highly.

2. **Allocate the highest valued items first**:
   - Start by giving each agent one of their most valued items, ensuring they get high value from at least one item.

3. **Continue allocation by considering remaining values and items**:
   - After the most valued item, allocate the remaining items to balance the perceived value.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 1 and 5. Agent 0 gets a total value of 92 (from item 1) and 39 (from item 5), totaling 131.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 0 and 4. Agent 1 gets a total value of 96 (from item 0) and 95 (from item 4), totaling 191.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 2, 3, and 6. Agent 2 gets a total value of 34 (from item 2), 35 (from item 3), and 82 (from item 6), totaling 151.

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value among the agents by ensuring that each agent receives a combination of high and medium-valued items.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.
