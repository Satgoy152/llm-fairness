Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  59  81  76  30  46  85
1  73  65  18  90  98  28  47
2  37  13  40  95  73  51   8
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [73 65 18 90 98 28 47]
 [37 13 40 95 73 51  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as best as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations. We will try to maximize the minimum satisfaction across all agents.

Let's examine the valuations and come up with an allocation strategy:

```
Valuation Table:
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  59  81  76  30  46  85
1  73  65  18  90  98  28  47
2  37  13  40  95  73  51   8
```

1. **Identify High Valuation Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 6 most highly (85).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 most highly (98).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 most highly (95).

2. **Initial Allocation of Top Valued Items:**
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items by Valuation:**
   - The remaining items are 0, 1, 2, 5.

4. **Consider Remaining Valuations:**

   - For item 0:
     - Agent 0: 47
     - Agent 1: 73 (highest)
     - Agent 2: 37
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

   - For item 1:
     - Agent 0: 59 (highest)
     - Agent 1: 65
     - Agent 2: 13
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

   - For item 2:
     - Agent 0: 81 (highest)
     - Agent 1: 18
     - Agent 2: 40
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

   - For item 5:
     - Agent 0: 46
     - Agent 1: 28
     - Agent 2: 51 (highest)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

5. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 6
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 4
   - Agent 2: Items 3, 5

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the highest valuations of each agent while ensuring a fair distribution of items across all agents.
