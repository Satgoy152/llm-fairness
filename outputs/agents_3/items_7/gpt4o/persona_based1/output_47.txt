Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  63  47  99   4  40  72
1  44  12  95  55  79  19  40
2  48  19  76  39  83  70  89
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering individual valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method like the envy-free item allocation algorithm. One such approach could be the round robin method, where each agent takes turns picking their most valued item from the remaining pool of items until all items are allocated. 

Let's proceed with this method:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 99).
   - Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 95).
   - Agent 2 picks item 6 (value 89).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 6, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 1 (value 63).
   - Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 79).
   - Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 70).

3. **Round 3:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 10).
   - Agent 1 picks item 5, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 0 (value 44), but it's also taken. They choose item 3, but it's taken, so they pick item 6 (value 40).
   - Agent 2 picks item 4, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 2, but it's taken. They choose item 1 (value 19).

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 has items 3 and 1.
   - Agent 1 has items 2 and 4.
   - Agent 2 has items 6, 5, and 0.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [6, 5, 0]
}
```
