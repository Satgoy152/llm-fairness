Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50   3  14  27  60  57  56
1  37  71  36  86   0   3  88
2  13   9  94  59  36   2   8
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy, we typically aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they received at least as much value as any other agent. However, given the constraints of integer allocations and the need to allocate all items, achieving complete envy-freeness can be challenging.

Let's start by examining each agent's valuations and try to distribute items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring every item is allocated.

### Valuations Matrix:

```
    Items
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50   3  14  27  60  57  56
1  37  71  36  86   0   3  88
2  13   9  94  59  36   2   8
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize high-value items for Agent 0. The highest values are for items 4, 5, 6, and 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Focus on items with the highest valuations for Agent 1. Items 3, 6, and 1 are highly valued.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the most, followed by item 3.

### Proposed Allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 4, 5, 0
- Agent 1: Allocate items 3, 1
- Agent 2: Allocate items 2, 6

### Justification:

- **Agent 0** receives items 4, 5, and 0, with total valuations of 60 + 57 + 50 = 167.
- **Agent 1** receives items 3 and 1, with total valuations of 86 + 71 = 157.
- **Agent 2** receives items 2 and 6, with total valuations of 94 + 8 = 102.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable share of their high-valued items, balancing the total valuation across agents as much as possible.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items based on each agent's preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.
