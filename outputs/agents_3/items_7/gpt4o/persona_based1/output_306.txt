Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  50  15  10  23  62  17
1  15  24  32  60  35  77  17
2  38  21   5  10  22  70  24
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, based on the given valuations. An envy-free allocation implies that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation.

Here is a possible fair division of the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has a high valuation for item 0 and item 5. Allocating these items to Agent 0 could be the most satisfying choice for them.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 5 the most, but since item 5 is allocated to Agent 0, we look at the next best options. Allocating items 3 and 1 to Agent 1 provides a significant value, considering the other allocations.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has a high valuation for item 5, but since it has already been allocated, we focus on their next best options like item 6 and item 4.

Taking these preferences into account, the allocation could be as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 5
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 1
- **Agent 2**: Items 6, 4, 2

This allocation ensures each agent receives a bundle of items, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [6, 4, 2]
}
```
