Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  89  92  45  97  67  83
1  32  48  58  43  21  67   8
2  81  33   5  66  51  33  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means each agent should ideally prefer their own allocation over others'. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness and ensuring all items are allocated, a heuristic approach can be used to allocate the items.

Let's break down the valuations:
- Agent 0 values items quite highly across the board, especially items 1, 2, 4, and 6.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 2 and item 5.
- Agent 2 values items 0 and 3 the most.

Given these observations, we can try to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly while ensuring all items are distributed.

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 is assigned items they value highly: items 1, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 is assigned item 5 since it's one of the items they value highly, along with item 6.
- Agent 2 is allocated items 0 and 3, which they value significantly.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets some of their most valued items, while all items are distributed.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the total satisfaction of agents based on their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.
