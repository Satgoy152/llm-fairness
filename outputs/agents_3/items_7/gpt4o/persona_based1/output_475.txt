Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  77  75  97  20  53  82
1  75  28  71  10  48  81  47
2  69  70  99  97  85  57  17
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To solve the problem of fairly allocating the items among the agents, we use principles of fair division, particularly focusing on minimizing envy among agents. One approach is to try to allocate items such that each agent receives items with values that are as close as possible to their fair share of the total value of all items.

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**  
   - Agent 0: 68 + 77 + 75 + 97 + 20 + 53 + 82 = 472
   - Agent 1: 75 + 28 + 71 + 10 + 48 + 81 + 47 = 360
   - Agent 2: 69 + 70 + 99 + 97 + 85 + 57 + 17 = 494

2. **Calculate Fair Share for Each Agent:**  
   Since there are 7 items, each agent should ideally receive the equivalent value of approximately 7/3 of their total valuation. However, since we cannot split items, we aim for an allocation that is as close as possible to this ideal.

3. **Assign Items Iteratively:**
   - Start by allocating the highest-valued items (in terms of each agent's valuation) to the agents.
   
   **Step-by-step allocation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (97), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most (81), so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (99), so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 values item 6 next (82), so allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 next (75), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 next (85), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Finally, Agent 1 values item 1 more than Agent 0 and Agent 2, so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

This allocation aims to ensure each agent receives a set of items that maximize their individual valuation, given the constraints.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [5, 0, 1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
