Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  11   8   3   5  95   8
1  51  99  26  85  79  69  21
2  26  33  58  95  61  58  35
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [51 99 26 85 79 69 21]
 [26 33 58 95 61 58 35]]
Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, meaning each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what they could have obtained by swapping with another agent.

Given the valuations, we must consider the preferences of each agent and allocate the items accordingly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the allocation could be approached:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 (72) and item 5 (95) highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 (99) and item 3 (85) highly.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 (95) highly, followed by item 2 (58) and item 5 (58).

2. **Initial Assignment Based on High Values:**
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0 could also benefit from item 0 (second-highest value for Agent 0).
   - Agent 1 can take item 4 (next highest value not yet allocated and valuable to Agent 1).
   - Agent 2 can take item 2 (valuable to Agent 2).

4. **Allocate Final Item to Balance:**
   - The remaining item 6 can be allocated to Agent 0, as Agent 0 has the capacity to take another item without causing significant envy.

Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3

This allocation aims to minimize envy and provides a balanced distribution considering the high-value preferences of each agent.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
