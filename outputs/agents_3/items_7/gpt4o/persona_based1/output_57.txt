Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  30  25  21  72   9   0
1  88  84  52  46  39  17  96
2  40  18  36  57  95  98  27
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their individual valuations, we can use the concept of "envy-freeness" to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their own valuation. One approach is to maximize the total valuation that each agent receives while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation. 

Hereâ€™s one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (65), so we start by assigning item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (96), so we assign item 6 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (98), so we assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. Continuing this process, we assign the next highest valued items for each agent:

   - Agent 0 gets item 4 (72).
   - Agent 1 gets item 1 (84).
   - Agent 2 gets item 3 (57).

5. Finally, the only remaining item is item 2. We assign it to Agent 0, as they have the lowest number of items.

Thus, the allocations are:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 4, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 6 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives items 5 and 3.

These allocations ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, and the total number of items allocated sums up to 7.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 2],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [5, 3]
}
```
