Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42   3  37  39  22  87  29
1  67  32  60  61  82  40  62
2  88  27  70  21  75  12  59
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a method that can achieve envy-freeness or at least approximate it to minimize any potential envy. One possible approach is to use an algorithm like the "Adjusted Winner" or "Divide and Choose" that aims to balance the total value each agent receives, based on their valuations.

First, let's sum up the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 42 + 3 + 37 + 39 + 22 + 87 + 29 = 259
- Agent 1: 67 + 32 + 60 + 61 + 82 + 40 + 62 = 404
- Agent 2: 88 + 27 + 70 + 21 + 75 + 12 + 59 = 352

Given these total valuations, we aim to distribute the items so that the perceived value is as balanced as possible among the agents.

Let's proceed with a simple greedy allocation by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, subject to ensuring all agents receive at least one item:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 88.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 3 (though very low, it's the maximum for this item).
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 70.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 61.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 82.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 87.
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 62.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0 has items: [1, 5]
- Agent 1 has items: [3, 4, 6]
- Agent 2 has items: [0, 2]

This allocation respects the condition that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
