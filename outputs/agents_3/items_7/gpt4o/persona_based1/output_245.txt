Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  58  58  38  87  61  16
1  46  70   7  92  88  51  93
2  65  32  33  96  22  35  43
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items based on their valuations. Here's one way to approach the problem:

1. **Assess Total Value:** Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
   - Agent 0: 348
   - Agent 1: 447
   - Agent 2: 326

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy:** Attempt to allocate high-value items based on each agent's preferences to reduce envy.
   
3. **Fair Division:** An allocation is typically considered fair if each agent receives items they value at least as much as they perceive others to be receiving.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Prefers item 4 (87), item 1 (58), item 2 (58)
- **Agent 1:** Prefers item 6 (93), item 3 (92), item 4 (88)
- **Agent 2:** Prefers item 3 (96), item 0 (65)

**Allocation Strategy:**

- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 because itâ€™s their highest value and also has the highest value across the board.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 as it's among their top preferences and is highly valued.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 as it matches their highest valuation.
- Assign items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 0 as they are highly valued by them.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 as a balance for not getting some of their higher preferences.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's highest preferences while ensuring that the total items are distributed fairly among the agents.
