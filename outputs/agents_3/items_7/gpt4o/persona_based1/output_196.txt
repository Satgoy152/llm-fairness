Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  14  25  74  25  66  33
1  58  72  19  89  59   4  13
2  14  36  66  81   6   1  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division where each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as any other allocation. We will try to achieve a balance, ensuring that each agent feels they are not worse off compared to others based on their valuations.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that maximize their total valuation while considering the valuations of other agents to minimize envy. Items [0, 5, 6] are good choices for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Focus on items that Agent 1 values highly while taking into account the remaining items valued by other agents. Items [1, 3] are suitable for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Distribute the remaining items to Agent 2, ensuring they get items with the highest valuation for them. Items [2, 4] work well for Agent 2.

This allocation considers maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring a fair distribution of items. Let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items based on their preferences, aiming for an envy-free allocation.
