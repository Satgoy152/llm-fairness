Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  87  83  51  18  14  45
1  37  17  95  65  26  73  64
2  77  55   3  10  62  92  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use an approach called the "Envy-Free Item Assignment." This involves analyzing the valuations and attempting to allocate items in such a way that no agent prefers someone else's allocation to their own.

First, let's summarize the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [63, 87, 83, 51, 18, 14, 45]
- Agent 1: [37, 17, 95, 65, 26, 73, 64]
- Agent 2: [77, 55, 3, 10, 62, 92, 58]

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Assign the highest-valued items to each agent first:**

   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (87).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (95).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most (92).

2. **Allocate remaining items while aiming for envy-freeness:**

   - After assigning their highest-valued items, we have allocated items 1, 2, and 5.
   - Remaining items are 0, 3, 4, 6.

3. **Distribute remaining items by considering second-highest preferences and balancing allocations:**

   - Agent 0: Next highest is item 2 (83), but it's assigned to Agent 1. Next is item 0 (63).
   - Agent 1: After 2, next is item 6 (64).
   - Agent 2: After 5, next is item 0 (77), but it's assigned to Agent 0. Next is item 6 (58).

Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 0, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [2]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 3, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, and the distribution is as balanced as possible given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed and each agent ends up with a fair share based on their preferences.
