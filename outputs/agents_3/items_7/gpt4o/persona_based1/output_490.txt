Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  94  45  58  34   8  82
1  44  51  50  58  39   3  36
2  85  39  56   4  95  25  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or as close to envy-free allocation as possible. This means each agent should feel they received the most advantageous set of items given their preferences.

The given valuations are:

| Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0            | 73 | 94 | 45 | 58 | 34 |  8 | 82 |
| 1            | 44 | 51 | 50 | 58 | 39 |  3 | 36 |
| 2            | 85 | 39 | 56 |  4 | 95 | 25 | 62 |

To allocate items, we should ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their valuation while keeping in mind the goal of minimizing envy.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Assign items 1 and 6. The valuations for these items are 94 and 82 respectively. This gives agent 0 a total valuation of 176.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign items 2, 3, and 5. The valuations for these items are 50, 58, and 3 respectively. This gives agent 1 a total valuation of 111.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign items 0 and 4. The valuations for these items are 85 and 95 respectively. This gives agent 2 a total valuation of 180.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while also considering the distribution of high-value items across different agents to reduce envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
