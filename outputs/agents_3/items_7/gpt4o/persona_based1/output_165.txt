Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  63  64  42  88  31  73
1  68  36  96  32   5  21  78
2  71  46  33  92  66  61  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 63 64 42 88 31 73]
 [68 36 96 32  5 21 78]
 [71 46 33 92 66 61 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to minimize envy, we can use an approach based on maximizing each agent's happiness or utility. Each agent's utility for an allocation is the sum of the values they have for the items they receive.

Let's analyze the situation:

**Agent 0's valuations:**
- Items: [27, 63, 64, 42, 88, 31, 73]

**Agent 1's valuations:**
- Items: [68, 36, 96, 32, 5, 21, 78]

**Agent 2's valuations:**
- Items: [71, 46, 33, 92, 66, 61, 49]

### Allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:** Prioritize items with the highest valuations to maximize utility.
   - Highest values: Item 4 (88), Item 2 (64)

2. **Agent 1:** Prioritize items with the highest valuations.
   - Highest values: Item 2 (96), Item 6 (78)
   - Item 2 was taken by Agent 0, so next highest: Item 0 (68)

3. **Agent 2:** Prioritize items with the highest valuations.
   - Highest values: Item 3 (92), Item 0 (71)
   - Item 0 was taken by Agent 1, so next highest: Item 5 (61)

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [4, 2]
- **Agent 1:** Items [6, 0]
- **Agent 2:** Items [3, 5, 1]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [3, 5, 1]
}
```
