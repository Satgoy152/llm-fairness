Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  94  97  13  81  55  99
1   9  34  17  62  73  13  42
2  97  83  97  33   7  40  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while minimizing envy, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if each agent feels that their share is at least as good as that of any other agent, based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations, a heuristic approach to achieve an envy-free allocation is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share overall. Since there are 7 items and 3 agents, one possible approach is to allocate approximately 2-3 items per agent, while trying to maximize each agent's utility from the items they receive.

Let's proceed with an allocation based on the highest valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most (97).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most (94).
3. **Item 2**: Agents 0 and 2 both value it equally (97). We can break the tie by giving it to Agent 0, as Agent 2 already received item 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most (62).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most (81).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most (55).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most (99).

Revisiting the allocation, we see Agent 0 is receiving too many items, so we need to adjust to ensure fairness:

- Let's give Item 5 to Agent 1 instead of Agent 0 (Agent 1 values it at 13). 

This adjustment helps distribute items more evenly among agents while considering their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items fairly among the agents, taking into account their individual valuations and ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the total value.
