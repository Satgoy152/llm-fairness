Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  37  74  38  90  77  36
1  60  40  70  14   0   7  30
2  54  61  49  93  84   9  23
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a way that is fair and envy-free, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, if possible. This often helps in achieving an envy-free allocation.

2. **Balancing the Allocation:**
   - After the initial allocation, check if any agent does not receive any items or if the allocation is imbalanced (i.e., one agent receiving too many items). Adjust the allocation by swapping items to ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share.

3. **Final Adjustments:**
   - Ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item if possible, while maintaining or improving the fairness of the allocation.

Let's implement this strategy:

- Agent 0's highest valuations are for items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 2.
- Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 3.

Assign the items based on these initial preferences:

- Give item 0 to Agent 0 (value: 95).
- Give item 2 to Agent 1 (value: 70).
- Give item 3 to Agent 2 (value: 93).

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 gets item 4 (value: 90), which they value significantly.
- Agent 2 can take item 1 (value: 61).
- Agent 0 can take item 5 (value: 77).
- Agent 1 gets item 6 (value: 30).

This allocation should be balanced and reasonably fair based on their valuations.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```
