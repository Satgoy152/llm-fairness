Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  14  18  75  68  30  62
1  16  92  77   2  67  42  55
2  14  17  42  90  55  80  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [16 92 77  2 67 42 55]
 [14 17 42 90 55 80 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent prefers their own allocation over any other agent's allocation, based on their individual valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0:  [89, 14, 18, 75, 68, 30, 62]
Agent 1:  [16, 92, 77, 2, 67, 42, 55]
Agent 2:  [14, 17, 42, 90, 55, 80, 86]
```

We can attempt to allocate the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share. One possible allocation strategy is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each receives a fair number of items. With 7 items to allocate among 3 agents, a balanced approach would be to give 2 items to each agent and 1 extra item to the agent with the lowest total valuation to maintain fairness.

Let's execute the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 89.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most at 92.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most at 77.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most at 90.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 68.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most at 80.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most at 86.

After assigning the items based on highest valuations, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2
- Agent 2: Items 3, 5, 6

This allocation is reasonably fair given the constraints, as each agent receives items they value highly, and the extra item is given to the agent who values it the most among the remaining items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
