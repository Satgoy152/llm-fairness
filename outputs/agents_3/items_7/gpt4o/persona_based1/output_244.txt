Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63   2  77  66  52   0  88
1  51  15  27  39  85  37  84
2  78  42  44  42  24  89  43
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items based on the given valuations, we'll aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items. While perfect envy-freeness can be challenging to achieve due to the discrete nature of the problem, we can aim for a distribution where no agent feels significantly disadvantaged compared to others.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Assign the items to the agent who values them the most, if possible**: This approach maximizes the satisfaction of individual agents for specific items.

2. **Ensure each agent gets an approximately equal number of items**: With 7 items and 3 agents, this means each agent should get about 2-3 items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most (78), so assign it to Agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 also values it the most (42), so assign it to Agent 2.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (77), so assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (66), so assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most (85), so assign it to Agent 1.
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most (89), so assign it to Agent 2.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most (88), so assign it to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 6
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 5

This allocation gives Agent 0 three items, Agent 1 one item, and Agent 2 three items. Although Agent 1 receives fewer items, they receive the item they value the most. This allocation is not perfectly envy-free but tries to balance high-value items among agents.

Finally, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
