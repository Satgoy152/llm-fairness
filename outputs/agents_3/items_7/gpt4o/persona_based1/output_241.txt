Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  98  65  83  42  43  76
1  43  40  19  90  72  67  91
2  61  90  60  58  28  70  44
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. This means that each agent should be as satisfied as possible with their allocation given their valuations of the items.

Here's a possible allocation that aims to balance the value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives items with high values for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Receives items that are highly valued by Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Receives items that have relatively good value for Agent 2.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate accordingly:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 1, and 3.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 3, 4, and 6.
- Agent 2 has a relatively balanced valuation with the highest for item 1.

Now, let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 6
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 4, 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their valuation given the constraints that each item is allocated once and all items are allocated.

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2, 4, 5]
}
```
