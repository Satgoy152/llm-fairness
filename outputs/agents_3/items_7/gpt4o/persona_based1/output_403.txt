Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  14  38  27  93  93  48
1  57  95  98  50   4  92  88
2  77  85  71  99  85  87  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 14 38 27 93 93 48]
 [57 95 98 50  4 92 88]
 [77 85 71 99 85 87 26]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim to minimize envy while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One possible approach is to use the maximin strategy, which seeks to maximize the minimum utility an agent receives, thereby preventing any agent from being significantly worse off than others.

Let's consider the valuations matrix:

```
Agent\Item  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0           42  14  38  27  93  93  48
1           57  95  98  50   4  92  88
2           77  85  71  99  85  87  26
```

We want to allocate these items to the agents while aiming for envy-freeness and balanced allocations. Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 4, 5 (both 93).
   - Allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items after 4 and 5 are allocated: 2 (98), 1 (95).
   - Allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items after 1, 2, 4, and 5 are allocated: 3 (99), 0 (77).
   - Allocate items 3 and 0 to Agent 2.

4. Remaining Item 6:
   - Check remaining agents' highest values:
     - Agent 0 values item 6 at 48.
     - Agent 1 values item 6 at 88.
     - Agent 2 values item 6 at 26.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in line with their preferences, attempting to avoid envy. Let's present this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
