Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  25  79  38  61  31  59
1  55   5  22   5  42  30  92
2  58  99  77   7  55  52  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 25 79 38 61 31 59]
 [55  5 22  5 42 30 92]
 [58 99 77  7 55 52 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division, ensuring that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the valuations provided, let's explore a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation of their allocated items.

### Valuations Table:
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  25  79  38  61  31  59
1  55   5  22   5  42  30  92
2  58  99  77   7  55  52  61
```

### Strategy:
1. **Identify High Value Preferences:** Start by identifying items that are highly valued by each agent.
2. **Assign Unique High Value Items:** Assign items to agents where they have a significantly higher valuation than others.
3. **Distribute Remaining Items:** Allocate the remaining items considering the next highest valuations to achieve an envy-free division.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initial High Value Assignments:**
   - Agent 2 highly values item 1 (99). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 6 (92). Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 highly values item 2 (79). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (55). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (38). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (61). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: While Agent 2 has a valuation of 52, it's the highest remaining for Agent 2. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their valuation while being fair and envy-free.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
