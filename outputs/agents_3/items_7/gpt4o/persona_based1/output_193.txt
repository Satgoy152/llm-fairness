Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  75  30  76  13  84  23
1  43  86  35  21   0  69  77
2  99  92  99  76  61  77  73
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, which means that each agent should not prefer another agent's allocation over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness with three agents and seven items might be challenging; thus, we aim for a fair allocation where each agent feels the distribution is equitable based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt a fair division:

### Agents' Valuations:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest valuations: Item 5 (84), Item 3 (76), Item 1 (75)
- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest valuations: Item 1 (86), Item 6 (77), Item 0 (43)
- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 2 (99), Item 1 (92)

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 2** highly values Item 0 and Item 2 equally (99 each) and Item 1 slightly less (92). Assign Item 0 and Item 2 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values Item 1, so assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** can be given Item 3 and Item 5, which are among their highest valuations.
4. Remaining Items (Item 4 and Item 6) need to be distributed considering remaining preferences:
   - **Agent 1** values Item 6 (77) highly, so assign Item 6 to Agent 1.
   - **Agent 0** can take Item 4, which has a non-zero value for them.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 5, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible given the constraints.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
