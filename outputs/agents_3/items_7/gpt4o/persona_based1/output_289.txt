Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99   5  57  64  45  31  71
1  23  66  12  60  33  88  23
2  50  59  38  82  31  54  56
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 59 38 82 31 54 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's preferences and valuations. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (99), so assigning it to them might help minimize envy as it's the most valuable item for them.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 5 (88), so assigning it to them might help minimize envy for the same reason.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3 (82), so assigning it to them might help minimize envy.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- For Agent 0, after considering item 0, we should try to maximize their overall value while considering the remaining items. Items 6 (71) and 3 (64) are also highly valued by Agent 0, but item 3 is already with Agent 2.
- For Agent 1, after item 5, they value item 1 (66) highly.
- For Agent 2, after item 3, they value item 1 (59) highly, but item 1 is better suited for Agent 1.

Here's a fair allocation that minimizes envy:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6 (valuations: 99, 71)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5, 4 (valuations: 66, 88, 33)
- Agent 2: Items 3, 2 (valuations: 82, 38)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly while keeping the total number of items distributed to exactly 7.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 5, 4],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```
