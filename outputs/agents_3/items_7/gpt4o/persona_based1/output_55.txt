Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  98  84  89  37   3  69
1  98  42  16   8  50  39  23
2  49  16  99  77   8  71   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[77 98 84 89 37  3 69]
 [98 42 16  8 50 39 23]
 [49 16 99 77  8 71  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their total valuation while maintaining as much fairness as possible. In this case, we will use the concept of maximizing each agent's happiness while also attempting to minimize envy.

First, let's assess the total value each agent has for all items to get an idea of their preferences:

- Agent 0: 77 + 98 + 84 + 89 + 37 + 3 + 69 = 457
- Agent 1: 98 + 42 + 16 + 8 + 50 + 39 + 23 = 276
- Agent 2: 49 + 16 + 99 + 77 + 8 + 71 + 6 = 326

Next, we will attempt to allocate items such that each agent's allocation is close to fair in terms of their valuations.

1. **Agent 0:** They highly value item 1 and item 3. Assign these to Agent 0.
   - Items assigned: [1, 3]

2. **Agent 1:** They highly value item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Items assigned: [0]

3. **Agent 2:** They highly value item 2 and item 5. Assign these to Agent 2.
   - Items assigned: [2, 5]

Now, let's allocate the remaining items 4 and 6:

- For item 4:
  - Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 at 50, Agent 2 at 8.
  - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 because it has the highest value from their perspective.

- For item 6:
  - Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 at 23, Agent 2 at 6.
  - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 because it has the highest value from their perspective.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: [1, 3, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [2, 5]

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
