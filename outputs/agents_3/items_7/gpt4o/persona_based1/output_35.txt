Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56   2  50  94  59  16  83
1  36  84  59  39  92  34  40
2  93   8   2  97  24  26  98
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[56  2 50 94 59 16 83]
 [36 84 59 39 92 34 40]
 [93  8  2 97 24 26 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should feel that they have received the best bundle according to their valuations.

First, let's summarize the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [56, 2, 50, 94, 59, 16, 83]
- Agent 1: [36, 84, 59, 39, 92, 34, 40]
- Agent 2: [93, 8, 2, 97, 24, 26, 98]

Now, let's focus on distributing the items in a way that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of high-value items according to their preferences.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values item 3 highly (94), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Values item 6 highly (83), so allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values item 1 highly (84), so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Values item 4 highly (92), so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values item 0 highly (93), so allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Values item 2 highly (2), but this is not a high value for them compared to others.
   - Values item 5 highly (26), but this is not a high value for them compared to others.
   - Values item 6 highly (98), but this is already allocated.

Reassign the remaining items to ensure all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Already has items 3 and 6.
- Agent 1: Already has items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2:
  - Allocate item 0, as it is the highest value for Agent 2.
  - Allocate items 2 and 5 to balance the allocation.

After re-evaluating the allocation for optimal valuation balance:

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of their top-valued items.
