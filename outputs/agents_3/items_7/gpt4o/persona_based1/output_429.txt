Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  34  61  73   4  99  16
1  97  40  18  67  45   3  45
2  31   7  26   3  96  57  79
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while focusing on minimizing envy, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations. A common approach is to allocate items one by one in descending order of valuation, ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items if possible.

Let's break down the allocation process:

1. **List items by highest valuation:**
   - Gather all the valuations in a list with their respective agent and item numbers.
   - Sort the list in descending order based on the valuation.

2. **Allocate items:**
   - Iterate through the sorted list and allocate the item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least two items (since there are 7 items and 3 agents).

3. **Ensure integer number of items for each agent:**
   - Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure that each agent receives a whole number of items.

Let's implement this:

1. **Valuations list:**  
   - Agent 0: (0, 86), (1, 34), (2, 61), (3, 73), (4, 4), (5, 99), (6, 16)
   - Agent 1: (0, 97), (1, 40), (2, 18), (3, 67), (4, 45), (5, 3), (6, 45)
   - Agent 2: (0, 31), (1, 7), (2, 26), (3, 3), (4, 96), (5, 57), (6, 79)

2. **Sorted list of valuations by highest value:**
   - (1, 0, 97), (0, 5, 99), (2, 4, 96), (0, 0, 86), (0, 3, 73), (2, 6, 79), (0, 2, 61), (1, 3, 67), (1, 4, 45), (1, 1, 40), (2, 5, 57), (2, 0, 31), (0, 1, 34), (2, 2, 26), (1, 2, 18), (0, 6, 16), (1, 6, 45), (2, 1, 7), (2, 3, 3), (1, 5, 3), (0, 4, 4)

3. **Allocate items:**
   - Agent 1 receives item 0 (valuation: 97)
   - Agent 0 receives item 5 (valuation: 99)
   - Agent 2 receives item 4 (valuation: 96)
   - Agent 0 receives item 3 (valuation: 73)
   - Agent 2 receives item 6 (valuation: 79)
   - Agent 0 receives item 2 (valuation: 61)
   - Agent 1 receives item 1 (valuation: 40)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least two items, which is necessary since we have 3 agents and 7 items.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers agents' valuations to minimize envy while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.
