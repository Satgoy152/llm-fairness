Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  84  85  92  61  67  26
1  71  39  39   2  29  43  53
2  24  71  60  59  30  58  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum value received by any agent, which is often a way to approach envy-freeness in discrete allocations. We aim to allocate the items such that each agent gets as fair a share as possible based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items:

- Agent 0: 95 + 84 + 85 + 92 + 61 + 67 + 26 = 510
- Agent 1: 71 + 39 + 39 + 2 + 29 + 43 + 53 = 276
- Agent 2: 24 + 71 + 60 + 59 + 30 + 58 + 19 = 321

To ensure a fair distribution, we will try to allocate items such that each agent gets a roughly equal share of their total valuation. We will start by allocating items with the highest valuation to each agent, trying to balance the overall valuation each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 highly values items 0 and 6, but since item 0 is more valuable to Agent 0, we consider other high-value items.
- Agent 2 highly values items 1 and 5.

Given these observations and aiming for fairness, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for Agent 0).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (second-highest valuation for Agent 2).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation for Agent 0).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (third-highest valuation for Agent 0).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (moderate valuation with less competition).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for Agent 2).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (highest available valuation for Agent 1).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 4, 6
- Agent 2: Items 1, 5

Let's verify the total valuations for each agent after this allocation:

- Agent 0: 95 (item 0) + 85 (item 2) + 92 (item 3) = 272
- Agent 1: 29 (item 4) + 53 (item 6) = 82
- Agent 2: 71 (item 1) + 58 (item 5) = 129

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of their total potential valuation based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
