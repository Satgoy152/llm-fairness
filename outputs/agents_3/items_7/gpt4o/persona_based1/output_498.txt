Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  43  88   8  10  64  72
1  44   3  91   1  73  64  12
2  43  76  31  38  19  63  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among agents and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, we will consider the valuations provided for each item by each agent. A common approach is to aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. Given this setup, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuation for items: 2 (88), 0 (76), 6 (72)
   - Allocate items: 2, 0

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuation for items: 2 (91), 4 (73), 5 (64)
   - Allocate items: 4, 5

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuation for items: 1 (76), 5 (63), 0 (43)
   - Allocate items: 1, 3, 6

After considering allocation based on highest valuations, rebalancing for fairness, and ensuring all items are allocated, the final fair allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least two items, and the distribution is balanced according to their preferences.
