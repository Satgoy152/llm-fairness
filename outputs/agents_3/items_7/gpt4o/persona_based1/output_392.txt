Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  15  84  77  61  81  37
1  98  60  93  86  92   7  50
2  59  90  35  44  77   0  68
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to consider each agent's valuations and aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation. The goal is to allocate all 7 items such that the distribution is as fair as possible.

Given the valuations of the items by each agent, we can use an approach that tries to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives items that they value highly. One common approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where each agent takes turns selecting their most preferred remaining item.

Let's analyze the given table:

```
Valuations:
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  15  84  77  61  81  37
1  98  60  93  86  92   7  50
2  59  90  35  44  77   0  68
```

Allocation Strategy:
1. Identify the highest-valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate items by rotating through agents to ensure each gets highly valued items.

Let's allocate the items step by step.

### Step 1: Initial Allocations
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (value 98). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (value 84). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (value 90). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

### Step 2: Remaining Items
- Remaining items: 3, 4, 5, 6.

### Step 3: Continue Allocation
- Agent 1's next highest valued item is 4 (value 92). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0's next highest valued item is 5 (value 81). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 2's next highest valued item is 6 (value 68). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

### Step 4: Final Allocation
- One item remains: 3.
- Agent 1 values item 3 next highest (value 86). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

Now each agent has been allocated items such that the allocation attempts to respect the individual valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed.

### Final Allocations
Given the allocations above, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value fairly highly based on their preferences.
