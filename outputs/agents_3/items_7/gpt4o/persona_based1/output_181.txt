Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  91  18  54  63  69  99
1  80  91  57  80  67  52  19
2  90  38  88  64  13  22  89
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21 91 18 54 63 69 99]
 [80 91 57 80 67 52 19]
 [90 38 88 64 13 22 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to minimize envy among the agents while ensuring each agent receives whole items.

First, let's examine the item valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [21, 91, 18, 54, 63, 69, 99]
- Agent 1: [80, 91, 57, 80, 67, 52, 19]
- Agent 2: [90, 38, 88, 64, 13, 22, 89]

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can start by assigning items based on the highest valuation of each agent, while ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent. 

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value: Item 6 (99)
   - Second highest: Item 1 (91)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 1 (91)
   - Second highest: Item 0 (80)
   - Third highest: Item 3 (80)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (90)
   - Second highest: Item 2 (88)
   - Third highest: Item 6 (89)

Following these preferences while ensuring no duplication:

- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1, since Item 6 is already taken)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2, since Item 6 and Item 1 are already taken)

For the remaining items, we continue to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Item 2: Assign to Agent 2 (second-highest value for Agent 2)
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 1 (third-highest value for Agent 1, next best available)
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 0 (next best available for Agent 0)
- Item 5: Assign to Agent 0 (next best available for Agent 0)

The final allocations are:

Agent 0: Items [4, 5, 6]  
Agent 1: Items [1, 3]  
Agent 2: Items [0, 2]  

In JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
