Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  35  69  61  45  72  88
1  66  82  13  86  12  79  68
2  33  99  55  21  27  23  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair allocation, we consider each agent's valuation for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation, if possible, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we aim for a distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high valuations on items 5 and 6. Allocating these items to agent 0 could maximize their satisfaction: 
   - Items: 5, 6

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 highly. Item 1 also has a high valuation for this agent:
   - Items: 3, 1

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1, which is already allocated, so the next best items are 2 and 0:
   - Items: 2, 0, 4

Let's check the allocations for the total number of items:
- Agent 0: 2 items (5, 6)
- Agent 1: 2 items (3, 1)
- Agent 2: 3 items (2, 0, 4)

Total: 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 items.

The allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly, which helps to maintain fairness and minimize envy among agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [2, 0, 4]
}
```
