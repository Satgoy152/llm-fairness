Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  22  67  52  88  60  67
1  35  82  57  56  68  69  50
2  94  51  20  76  86   4   8
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[62 22 67 52 88 60 67]
 [35 82 57 56 68 69 50]
 [94 51 20 76 86  4  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with the aim of achieving envy-freeness, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common method is to use the "maximum marginal utility" strategy, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [62, 22, 67, 52, 88, 60, 67]
- Agent 1's valuations: [35, 82, 57, 56, 68, 69, 50]
- Agent 2's valuations: [94, 51, 20, 76, 86, 4, 8]

For each item, we will allocate it to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 94, which is the highest.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 82, which is the highest.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 67, which is the highest (agent 0 and 2 both value it at 67, so we can choose either).
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 76, which is the highest.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 88, which is the highest.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 69, which is the highest.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 67, which is the highest.

Thus, the allocation can be represented as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 4, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 5
- Agent 2 receives items: 0, 3

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
