Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  95  96  27  25  59  64
1  93  42  21  30  60  25  60
2  26   2  42  24  12  21  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 42 21 30 60 25 60]
 [26  2 42 24 12 21 42]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we will aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent believes they have received the best bundle of items according to their own valuations. Given that there are 7 items and 3 agents, each agent will receive either 2 or 3 items.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [61, 95, 96, 27, 25, 59, 64]
- Agent 1: [93, 42, 21, 30, 60, 25, 60]
- Agent 2: [26, 2, 42, 24, 12, 21, 42]

We have to ensure that each agent gets an allocation that they value highly, while dividing the items fairly.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: Item 2 (96), Item 1 (95)
   - Allocate Item 2 and Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Available items: [0, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   - Highest valued remaining items: Item 0 (93), Item 4 (60)
   - Allocate Item 0 and Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining items: [3, 5, 6]
   - Highest valued items: Item 6 (42), Item 2 (42)
   - Allocate Item 6 and Item 2 to Agent 2.

Since Item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, Agent 2 can instead receive Item 3 (24) and Item 5 (21).

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 2]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [3, 5, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly while keeping the total number of items allocated equal to 7.

### JSON Format Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
