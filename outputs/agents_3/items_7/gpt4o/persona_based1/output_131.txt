Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  34  20  85  57   1  31
1  80  99  86  30  20  58  55
2  19  64  10   6  87  30  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to allocate the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. This is known as an envy-free allocation. Given the valuations provided in the table, we want to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:** Determine which items each agent values the most.
   
2. **Initial Allocation:** Start by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent if possible.

3. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness:** Check if any agent envies another's allocation. If so, adjust the allocation to reduce or eliminate the envy.

4. **Ensure Completeness:** Make sure all 7 items are allocated.

5. **Validate the Allocation:** Confirm that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of allocated items is 7.

Let's apply this process:

1. **Agent 0's Top Valuations:** Items 3 (85), 0 (61), 4 (57)
2. **Agent 1's Top Valuations:** Items 1 (99), 2 (86), 0 (80)
3. **Agent 2's Top Valuations:** Items 6 (90), 4 (87), 1 (64)

**Proposed Allocation:**
- **Agent 0:** Items 0 (61), 3 (85) – Total value = 146
- **Agent 1:** Items 1 (99), 2 (86), 5 (58) – Total value = 243
- **Agent 2:** Items 4 (87), 6 (90) – Total value = 177

This allocation ensures that:
- Each agent receives items based on their highest valuations.
- The total number of items allocated = 7.
- Each agent gets a non-zero allocation.

**Final Allocations:**
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation should reduce envy among agents given their preferences and the value they receive from their allocated items.
