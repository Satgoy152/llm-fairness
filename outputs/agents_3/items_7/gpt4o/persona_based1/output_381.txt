Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  73  31  73  37  87  23
1   8  94  94  35  28  49  31
2   5  96   8  31  63  66  67
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we can use a simple sequential allocation or the maximum marginal value method, which attempts to allocate items to agents based on their highest marginal value. Here, we try to balance the allocation process by ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of highly valued items.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 0 (75)
   - Next highest: Item 5 (87)
   - Remaining: Item 1 (73)
   - Total: [0, 5, 1]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (94)
   - Next highest: Item 1 (94)
   - Remaining: Item 3 (35)
   - Total: [2, 3]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 1 (96)
   - Next highest: Item 6 (67)
   - Remaining: Item 4 (63)
   - Total: [1, 6, 4]

Considering the allocations:

- Agent 0 will receive items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 will receive items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 will receive items 1, 4, and 6.

However, we see agent 2 has duplicate item 1, which is not allowed. Let's adjust it to ensure uniqueness and fairness:

### Final allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items: 0, 5
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 1, 2, 3
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 4, 6

This distribution ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
