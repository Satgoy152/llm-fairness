Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  47  60  62  93  90  83
1  29  10  74  66  55  23  35
2  43  82  50  96  86  32   8
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[77 47 60 62 93 90 83]
 [29 10 74 66 55 23 35]
 [43 82 50 96 86 32  8]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as any other agent's bundle. This is often challenging, especially with integer constraints, but we can attempt to approximate it.

### Valuations Table
- Agent 0: [77, 47, 60, 62, 93, 90, 83]
- Agent 1: [29, 10, 74, 66, 55, 23, 35]
- Agent 2: [43, 82, 50, 96, 86, 32, 8]

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Identify High-Valuation Items**: Assign items where agents have the highest relative value compared to others to reduce envy.
2. **Distribute Remaining Items**: Allocate remaining items to balance the total value perceived by each agent.

### Allocation Process
1. **Assigning High-Valuation Items**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest at 77. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest at 82. Assign to Agent 2.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 74. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest at 96. Assign to Agent 2.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it the highest at 93. Assign to Agent 0.

2. **Distributing Remaining Items**:
   - Item 5: Assign to Agent 0 who values it at 90, which is the highest.
   - Item 6: Distribute to Agent 1 to balance allocations, even though Agent 0 values it higher; this helps to mitigate envy and balance the total value across agents.

### Final Allocations
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the high value items among the agents and ensure that total values perceived by each agent are reasonably distributed.
