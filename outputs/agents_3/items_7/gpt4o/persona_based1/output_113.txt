Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  95  15  13  85  69  22
1  93  80  81  74  51  81  20
2  76  50  58  61  76  23  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to maximize each agent's satisfaction by ensuring that they receive a bundle of items that they value highly relative to what others receive. One method to achieve this is the "max-min envy-free" allocation, where we try to minimize the maximum envy.

Let's analyze the valuations first:

- Agent 0 values: [55, 95, 15, 13, 85, 69, 22]
- Agent 1 values: [93, 80, 81, 74, 51, 81, 20]
- Agent 2 values: [76, 50, 58, 61, 76, 23, 55]

We aim to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied based on their valuations, and no agent feels envious of another's allocation if possible.

One possible allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 5
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 2
- Agent 2 gets items: 3, 4, 6

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly compared to other agents, while also considering the total number of items allocated.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
