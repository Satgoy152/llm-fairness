Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  30  46   7  64  25   0
1  25  80  19  83  47  53  91
2  23  74  72  45  44  21  30
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution, ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Each agent has a unique set of valuations for the items. 
   - We will try to allocate items such that no agent feels they would be better off with the allocation of any other agent.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by assigning the highest-valued items for each agent if possible, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item they value highly.
   - Continue assigning items by balancing the total value of each agent's allocation.

3. **Assignments**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most, so initially, assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most, so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 highly, so assign item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Now, consider remaining items and the next highest values to balance allocations.

4. **Balancing Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 should get another item they value relatively high. Item 4 is a good candidate (value of 64).
   - Agent 1 should get item 3, which they value significantly (value of 83).
   - Agent 2 may receive item 6, which is the least valued item by others but adds to their allocation.

5. **Final Adjustment**:
   - With items 5 and 6 left, assign item 5 to Agent 1 as it contributes more to their total value than to others.
   - Ensure that all items are allocated with each agent getting a fair share based on their valuations.

After considering these points, the allocation can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that they should not envy another agent's allocation, given the provided valuations.
