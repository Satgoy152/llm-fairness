Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   5  87  61  67  32  79  57
1  21  53  19   2  29  86  38
2  76  46  27  80   0  26  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [21 53 19  2 29 86 38]
 [76 46 27 80  0 26 58]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among agents, we'll use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation while trying to maintain balance. We need to give each agent a set of items such that their valuations are as equal as possible, ensuring that no agent envies another.

Let's calculate an allocation using a simplistic approach, aiming for envy-freeness:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [5, 87, 61, 67, 32, 79, 57]
   - Highest value items: 1 (87), 5 (79), 3 (67)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [21, 53, 19, 2, 29, 86, 38]
   - Highest value items: 5 (86), 1 (53), 0 (21)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [76, 46, 27, 80, 0, 26, 58]
   - Highest value items: 3 (80), 0 (76), 6 (58)

Given these preferences, let's assign items to each agent while trying to maximize their satisfaction and ensuring all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items that are highest on their list and not allocated to others.
  - Items: 1, 5

- **Agent 1**: Assign items that maximize their satisfaction without duplicating high-value assignments.
  - Items: 0, 4

- **Agent 2**: Assign remaining items that maximize their valuation.
  - Items: 2, 3, 6

After this allocation, all items are distributed, and each agent receives a set that maximizes their value under the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
