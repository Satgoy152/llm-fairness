Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  10  48  27  61  98   3
1  14  95  85  24  72  28   2
2   2  68   2  98  48  28  47
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a method that aims to minimize envy and attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent. One common approach is to use the Envy-Free Allocation method, which tries to ensure that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**:  
   For each agent, sum up their valuations for all items to get their total valuation.

   - Agent 0: 66 + 10 + 48 + 27 + 61 + 98 + 3 = 313
   - Agent 1: 14 + 95 + 85 + 24 + 72 + 28 + 2 = 320
   - Agent 2: 2 + 68 + 2 + 98 + 48 + 28 + 47 = 293

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Values**:  
   Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations to approximate envy-freeness.

   - Item 5 (value 98 for agent 0, highest for any agent): Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3 (value 98 for agent 2, highest for any agent): Assign to Agent 2.
   - Item 1 (value 95 for agent 1, highest for agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:  
   Allocate the remaining items to balance the envy and ensure each agent gets a reasonable share of their total valuation.

   - Item 4 (value 72 for agent 1, second-highest): Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 2 (value 85 for agent 1, highest remaining): Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 0 (value 66 for agent 0, highest remaining): Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 6 (value 47 for agent 2, highest remaining): Assign to Agent 2.

The allocations attempt to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, and the distribution is done in a way that aims to minimize potential envy among the agents.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations, with Agent 0 receiving items 0 and 5, Agent 1 receiving items 1, 2, and 4, and Agent 2 receiving items 3 and 6.
