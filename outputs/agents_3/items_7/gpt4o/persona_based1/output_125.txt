Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94   3  39  26  75  18  21
1  65  10  57  66  45  86   1
2  82  34  26  66  65  47  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We'll use a method that maximizes the minimum satisfaction across agents. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 5.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 0 as well, but slightly less than Agent 0.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 because it maximizes their valuation significantly.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 as it is the highest valued item for them.
   - Allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 2, as these maximize their total valuation and it also balances the distribution of high-valued items.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items 1, 2, and 6 are of lower value and can be distributed to ensure each agent receives a fair number of items.

4. **Final Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 6
   - Agent 1: Items 5, 2, 1
   - Agent 2: Items 3, 4

This allocation maximizes individual satisfaction while maintaining overall fairness.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5, 2, 1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
