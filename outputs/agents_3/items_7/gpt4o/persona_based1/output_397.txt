Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  70   2  17  75  86  62
1  91  10  71   7  70  82   7
2  16  78  32  14  32  61  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that is envy-free as much as possible. Here, we will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair given their individual valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [84, 70, 2, 17, 75, 86, 62]
- Agent 1: [91, 10, 71, 7, 70, 82, 7]
- Agent 2: [16, 78, 32, 14, 32, 61, 61]

We will try to allocate items to minimize envy by considering agents' highest valued items and ensuring each agent gets a fair share of their valued items.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items: 5 (86), 0 (84), 4 (75)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (91), 5 (82), 2 (71)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued items: 1 (78), 5 (61), 6 (61)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Continue Allocating Remaining Items:**

   After ensuring each agent gets at least one of their top valued items, we allocate the remaining items:

   - Agent 0 has item 5. Next best for Agent 0: item 4 (75)
   - Agent 1 has item 0. Next best for Agent 1: item 2 (71)
   - Agent 2 has item 1. Next best for Agent 2: items 5 or 6 (both 61). However, item 5 is already taken. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

   Remaining items: 3, 4 (allocated to Agent 0), 2 (allocated to Agent 1).

5. **Final allocations:** 

   After allocation of the remaining items, we will have:

   - Agent 0: [5, 4]
   - Agent 1: [0, 2]
   - Agent 2: [1, 6, 3]

**Allocation in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 6, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their utility based on their valuations while distributing the items as fairly as possible given their preferences.
