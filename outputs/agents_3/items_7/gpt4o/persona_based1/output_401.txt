Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  59  86   4  34  36  40
1   3  18  70  51  47  21  17
2  79  92   1  35  35  60  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible and considers the preferences of each agent. We will follow a strategy to minimize envy and aim for fairness based on the given valuations.

Let's examine the valuations and distribute the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High preference for item 2 (value 86).
   - Medium preference for item 1 (value 59) and item 6 (value 40).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High preference for item 2 (value 70).
   - Medium preference for item 4 (value 47) and item 3 (value 51).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High preference for item 1 (value 92).
   - Medium preference for item 0 (value 79) and item 6 (value 86).

Given these preferences, let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0:** This is highly valued by Agent 0 (86) and Agent 1 (70). To minimize envy, give it to Agent 0 for its top preference.

2. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 values item 1 the most (92), so we assign it to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate item 6 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 also has a high valuation for item 6 (86). Assigning item 6 to Agent 2 maximizes their utility.

4. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 4 (47), and it is unallocated.

5. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 3 (51), which is a reasonable allocation for them.

6. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0 (79). Giving it to them maximizes their utility.

7. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 has a medium valuation for item 5 (36), so it is suitable for them.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the preferences and maintain fairness as much as possible, given the constraints.
