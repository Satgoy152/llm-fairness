Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  21  65  12  47  59  76
1  46  64  32   3  62  30  13
2  22  70  71  55  44  84  81
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering envy-freeness and integer allocation, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation, based on their own valuation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** Sum the value each agent assigns to all items to understand their total valuation perspective.

    - Agent 0: \(0 + 21 + 65 + 12 + 47 + 59 + 76 = 280\)
    - Agent 1: \(46 + 64 + 32 + 3 + 62 + 30 + 13 = 250\)
    - Agent 2: \(22 + 70 + 71 + 55 + 44 + 84 + 81 = 427\)

2. **Determine Fair Share for Each Agent:** Divide the total value by the number of agents to find what would be a fair share if fractional allocations were allowed.

    - Fair share for each agent: \( \frac{280 + 250 + 427}{3} \approx 319\)

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Preferences:** Start by allocating items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring no two agents get the same item.

4. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness:** Ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation, potentially requiring reassignment of items.

Here is one possible allocation that meets these requirements:

- Agent 0: Items 6 (value 76), 5 (value 59), and 1 (value 21) 
  - Total value for Agent 0 = 76 + 59 + 21 = 156

- Agent 1: Items 0 (value 46), 4 (value 62), and 3 (value 3)
  - Total value for Agent 1 = 46 + 62 + 3 = 111

- Agent 2: Items 2 (value 71)
  - Total value for Agent 2 = 71

Given this allocation, each agent has received items according to their preferences, and the total values reflect an attempt to minimize envy.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 1],
    "1": [0, 4, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their own valuations, aiming to reduce any potential envy. It also ensures all items are allocated, and the integer allocation condition is met.
