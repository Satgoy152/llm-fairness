Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4  82  12  24  58  86  81
1   4  39  27  69  22   7  51
2  29  50  78  30  30  82  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

We will start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 4 + 82 + 12 + 24 + 58 + 86 + 81 = 347
- Agent 1: 4 + 39 + 27 + 69 + 22 + 7 + 51 = 219
- Agent 2: 29 + 50 + 78 + 30 + 30 + 82 + 93 = 392

The goal is to allocate the items to minimize envy and distribute them fairly. One common approach is to use the "round-robin" or "sequential picking" method, where agents take turns selecting the most valuable remaining item according to their own preferences. However, in this specific scenario, since we're looking for a fair division, let's consider an allocation that balances the total value each agent receives:

Let's allocate items as follows:

1. Agent 2 highly values items 2, 5, and 6. We can allocate these items to Agent 2: 
   - Items: 2, 5, 6
   - Total value for Agent 2: 78 + 82 + 93 = 253

2. Agent 0 values item 1 the most, so we can allocate it to Agent 0:
   - Item: 1
   - Total value for Agent 0: 82

3. Agent 1 values item 3 the most, followed by item 0. We can allocate these items to Agent 1:
   - Items: 3, 0
   - Total value for Agent 1: 69 + 4 = 73

4. Finally, we need to allocate item 4, which is valued moderately by Agent 0 and Agent 2. We allocate it to Agent 0, balancing their total value received:
   - Item: 4
   - Total value for Agent 0: 82 + 58 = 140

Now, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4 (Total Value: 140)
- Agent 1: Items 3, 0 (Total Value: 73)
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5, 6 (Total Value: 253)

This allocation seeks to balance the total values among the agents, aiming to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
