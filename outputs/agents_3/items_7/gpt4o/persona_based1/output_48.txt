Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  10  44  58  52  77  87
1  67  75  25  37  57  43  67
2  56  65  59   0  20  71  87
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [67 75 25 37 57 43 67]
 [56 65 59  0 20 71 87]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim for an envy-free distribution, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own.

To achieve this, we can use a heuristic approach by considering each agent's preferences and trying to balance the total value each agent receives. Let's summarize the agents' total valuations for all items and their preferences:

1. Agent 0 values: [2, 10, 44, 58, 52, 77, 87]
2. Agent 1 values: [67, 75, 25, 37, 57, 43, 67]
3. Agent 2 values: [56, 65, 59, 0, 20, 71, 87]

Now, let's attempt a fair allocation by considering each agent's preferences and balancing their total received value:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 6 (87) and item 5 (77).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (75) and item 0 (67).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 6 (87) and item 5 (71).

We want to maximize the total value each agent receives while avoiding envy.

A fair allocation could be:
- Assign items 6 and 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 0, 1, and 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 3 and 5 to Agent 2.

Let's evaluate the total values:
- Agent 0: 87 (item 6) + 44 (item 2) = 131
- Agent 1: 67 (item 0) + 75 (item 1) + 57 (item 4) = 199
- Agent 2: 0 (item 3) + 71 (item 5) = 71

This allocation attempts to balance the values while respecting each agent's preferences.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
