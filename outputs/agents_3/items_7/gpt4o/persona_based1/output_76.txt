Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  14  62  48  87  86   2
1  35   9   6  65  69  20  48
2  36  27  13  55  69  83  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[13 14 62 48 87 86  2]
 [35  9  6 65 69 20 48]
 [36 27 13 55 69 83 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [13, 14, 62, 48, 87, 86, 2]
- Agent 1: [35, 9, 6, 65, 69, 20, 48]
- Agent 2: [36, 27, 13, 55, 69, 83, 86]

Based on these valuations, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent feels they receive a fair share according to their preferences.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 87. Let's allocate it to Agent 0.
2. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 83. Let's allocate it to Agent 2.
3. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 86. Let's allocate it to Agent 2.
4. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 35. Let's allocate it to Agent 1.
5. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 14. Let's allocate it to Agent 0.
6. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 62. Let's allocate it to Agent 0.
7. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 65. Let's allocate it to Agent 1.

This allocation respects the preferences and tries to minimize envy:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 6]

Now, presenting the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
