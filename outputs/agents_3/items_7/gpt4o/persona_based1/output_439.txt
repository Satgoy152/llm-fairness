Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  76   0  68  40  45  16
1  34  63  14  64  26  24   1
2  52  35  57  89   2   3  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 7 76  0 68 40 45 16]
 [34 63 14 64 26 24  1]
 [52 35 57 89  2  3 86]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent gets an allocation that maximizes their perceived value. We can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value for the items they receive, while also ensuring that every item is allocated exactly once.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0 valuations: [7, 76, 0, 68, 40, 45, 16]  
Agent 1 valuations: [34, 63, 14, 64, 26, 24, 1]  
Agent 2 valuations: [52, 35, 57, 89, 2, 3, 86]  

We'll follow these steps to allocate items:

1. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by agent 2 (89). Allocate to agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (76). Allocate to agent 0.
3. **Item 6**: Highest valuation by agent 2 (86). Allocate to agent 2.
4. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by agent 2 (52). Allocate to agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (40). Allocate to agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (45). Allocate to agent 0.
7. **Item 2**: Remaining item with highest valuation by agent 2 (57). Allocate to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, while minimizing the possibility of envy.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
