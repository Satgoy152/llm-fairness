Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  77  31  49  51  58  10
1  56  28  70   6  88  38  98
2  18  54  87  11  84  89  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[20 77 31 49 51 58 10]
 [56 28 70  6 88 38 98]
 [18 54 87 11 84 89 19]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item and aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, given their own valuations.

Here's the given valuation table for clarification:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 20 | 77 | 31 | 49 | 51 | 58 | 10 |
| 1          | 56 | 28 | 70 | 6  | 88 | 38 | 98 |
| 2          | 18 | 54 | 87 | 11 | 84 | 89 | 19 |

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we will attempt to give each agent a set of items that maximizes their own valuation while ensuring that the allocation is fair. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items such that high individual valuations are captured while considering overall envy-freeness.
   - Agent 0 highly values item 1 (77) and item 5 (58).

2. **Agent 1**: Assign items to maximize valuations.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 6 (98) and item 4 (88).

3. **Agent 2**: Assign items to maximize valuations.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 2 (87) and item 5 (89).

However, item 5 is valued highly by both Agent 0 and Agent 2. To ensure fairness, we will adjust allocations to achieve a balance:

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 2, 5]

This allocation aims to balance the distribution of values across agents given their preferences, ensuring that the total number of items allocated remains 7.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
