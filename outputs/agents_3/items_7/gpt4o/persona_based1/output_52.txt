Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  20  10  63  76  46  11
1  70  64  91  65  33  48  70
2  70  60  53  89  44  80  13
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and tries to maximize total utility. One possible approach to achieve this is to use the "Envy-Free up to one item" (EF1) criterion, which ensures that any envy between agents can be eliminated by removing at most one item from any allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0** values:  
   - Highest valued item: 0 (97)
   - Others: 4 (76), 3 (63), 5 (46), 1 (20), 6 (11), 2 (10)

2. **Agent 1** values:  
   - Highest valued item: 2 (91)
   - Others: 0 (70), 6 (70), 1 (64), 3 (65), 5 (48), 4 (33)

3. **Agent 2** values:  
   - Highest valued item: 3 (89)
   - Others: 5 (80), 0 (70), 1 (60), 2 (53), 4 (44), 6 (13)

We can try the following allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 4. These are among the highest valued items for Agent 0.

- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 2 and 6. Item 2 is the highest valued for Agent 1, and item 6 also has a high value.

- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 3, 5, and 1. Item 3 is the highest valued for Agent 2, and the other items also have significant value.

This allocation attempts to give each agent a portion of the items they value highly while trying to ensure that envy is minimized.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 5, 1]
}
```

This allocation uses all 7 items, and each agent receives items according to their preferences, given the constraint of distributing all items fairly.
