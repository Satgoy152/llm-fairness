Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  99  37  64  23  22  13
1  47  82  44  38   5  87   0
2   9  47  32  41  78  26  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as being at least as valuable as the allocations given to the other agents.

Using the valuations provided, let's consider a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (99) and item 3 moderately (64). These two items together provide significant value to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 5 (87) and item 0 (47).
- Agent 2 values item 4 (78), which is the highest single valuation they have for any item.

Let's allocate the items based on these observations:

1. Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 0, as they provide the highest total value (99 + 64 = 163).
2. Assign items 0 and 5 to Agent 1, which gives them a total value of 134.
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, the highest value item for Agent 2, along with items 2 and 6, which together provide a reasonable total valuation for Agent 2 (78 + 32 + 55 = 165).

This allocation aims to balance the perceived fairness of the distribution. Each agent receives an allocation of items they value significantly, helping to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
