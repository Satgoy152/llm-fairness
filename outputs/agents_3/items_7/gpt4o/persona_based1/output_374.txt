Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  95  37  55  16  77  34
1  42  74  21  97  16  59  40
2  81  79  44  21  84  40  82
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness (where each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation), we need to carefully examine the agents' valuations and decide on an allocation that balances these valuations as closely as possible.

Here's a breakdown of the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: 75, 95, 37, 55, 16, 77, 34
- Agent 1: 42, 74, 21, 97, 16, 59, 40
- Agent 2: 81, 79, 44, 21, 84, 40, 82

A potential allocation strategy is to assign items to agents where they have relatively high valuations compared to the other agents, while ensuring no agent feels envious of another's allocation. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items 1: Agent 0 values this highly at 95, which is the highest among all.
   - Item 5: Valued at 77, second highest for this item.
   - Total value for Agent 0: 172

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values this at 97, which is the highest among all.
   - Item 6: Valued at 40, which is adequate given the remaining options.
   - Total value for Agent 1: 137

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values this at 81, which is the highest for this item.
   - Item 2: Valued at 44, highest for this item.
   - Item 4: Valued at 84, the highest for this item.
   - Total value for Agent 2: 209

This allocation attempts to give each agent high-valued items according to their preferences, potentially minimizing envy.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
