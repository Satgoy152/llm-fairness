Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  35  53  93  17   8  58
1   6  40   2  87  36  89  66
2  98  46  25  12  88  37  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of utilities for each agent, ensuring no envy or minimal envy among them. The goal is to achieve a fair division where each agent feels they have received a fair portion based on their valuations.

We begin by examining the highest valuations for each item across the agents and attempt to allocate items to the agents who value them the most without leaving any agent with fewer items than others, where possible. We also try to balance the allocation to ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their total valuations across items.

### Valuation Matrix:
- Agent 0: [78, 35, 53, 93, 17, 8, 58]
- Agent 1: [6, 40, 2, 87, 36, 89, 66]
- Agent 2: [98, 46, 25, 12, 88, 37, 75]

### Approach:
1. Identify the highest value for each item and allocate the item to the respective agent.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item.
3. Adjust allocations to balance the total value received by each agent, if necessary.

### Allocation:
- Item 0: Highest value is by Agent 2 (98), allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 1: Highest value is by Agent 2 (46), allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 2: Highest value is by Agent 0 (53), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Highest value is by Agent 0 (93), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Highest value is by Agent 2 (88), allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 5: Highest value is by Agent 1 (89), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Highest value is by Agent 2 (75), allocate to Agent 2.

Now let's check the allocations and adjust if necessary to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0: [2, 3]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [0, 1, 4, 6]

Agent 0 has two items, Agent 1 has one item, and Agent 2 has four items. To ensure each agent gets a fair share, we need to adjust this allocation to balance the distribution while considering the agents' total valuations.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: [3, 2]
- Agent 1: [5, 6]
- Agent 2: [0, 1, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations, with an attempt to minimize envy among them.

{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
