Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  39  33   5   1  44  87
1  20  47  71  64   7  73  76
2  34  23  36  69  14  69  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [20 47 71 64  7 73 76]
 [34 23 36 69 14 69 37]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum envy. This involves ensuring that each agent views their allocation as acceptable or fair, given their valuations. We'll aim to distribute the items so that the perceived value by each agent is as balanced as possible, trying to minimize envy among agents.

Let's analyze the valuations and proceed with the allocation:

Agent 0's valuations: [55, 39, 33,  5,  1, 44, 87]  
Agent 1's valuations: [20, 47, 71, 64,  7, 73, 76]  
Agent 2's valuations: [34, 23, 36, 69, 14, 69, 37]  

To ensure a fair distribution, we will look to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is maximized given their preferences, while also considering the possibility of envy minimization.

Let's attempt an allocation:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 because it has the highest value for them (87).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because it has the highest value for them (71).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 because it has the highest value for them (69).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 1, 4, 5).

4. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 because it has the second-highest value for them (73).
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 because it has the second-highest value for them (55).
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 because it is still a reasonably high value (39) and fits well.

Now, only item 4 remains.

7. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 because none of the remaining unallocated items provide a high valuation to any agent, but Agent 2 has fewer items and this allocation balances the number of items across agents.

The allocations are:

Agent 0: Items [6, 0, 1]  
Agent 1: Items [2, 5]  
Agent 2: Items [3, 4]  

These allocations ensure that each agent gets at least a reasonable share of what they value highly, while also distributing the items as evenly as possible in terms of numbers.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
