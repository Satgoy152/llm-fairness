Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  96  94   6  64  46  21
1  32  71   1  30   3  38  29
2  59  26  51  48  89  89  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-freeness among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation to be at least as good as any other agent's allocation from their own perspective. One common approach to achieve this is using the concept of an "envy-free" allocation, which can be challenging to achieve perfectly with indivisible goods, but we can aim for a balanced allocation to minimize envy.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations for the items:

- Agent 0 values items highly at indices 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 values items moderately, with relatively higher values for items at indices 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 values items highly at indices 4 and 5.

Considering these valuations, we can try to allocate the items in such a way that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their perceived value while attempting to balance the overall distribution.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1]
  - Total value: 50 + 96 = 146
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 3, 6]
  - Total value: 1 + 30 + 29 = 60
- **Agent 2**: Items [4, 5]
  - Total value: 89 + 89 = 178

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations received by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives some of their higher-valued items. Although perfect envy-freeness might not be entirely achievable due to the indivisibility of items and differing valuations, this allocation tries to minimize dissatisfaction.

The allocations in the requested JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 6],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
