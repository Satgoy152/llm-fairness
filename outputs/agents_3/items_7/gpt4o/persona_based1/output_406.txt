Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  25  56  55  23  51  36
1  76  82  81  87  19  13  92
2   7  39  90  71  40  63  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim for a distribution where each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent values their own allocation. This can be challenging, especially with integer allocations and discrete items, but we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items and Preferences:** Start by identifying which items are highly valued by each agent and try to allocate those items to them, if it doesn't cause significant envy.

2. **Iterative Allocation:** Allocate items in rounds by giving each agent their most valued available item, ensuring we do not create a situation of significant envy.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** If some agents end up with significantly lower total value, adjust the allocation by swapping items to balance the perceived fairness.

We'll proceed with the allocation based on maximizing each agent's happiness while attempting to ensure fairness.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (56), followed by item 3 (55).
- Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (92), followed by item 3 (87), item 1 (82), and item 2 (81).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (90), followed by item 5 (63).

### Allocation Steps:
1. **Allocate High-Value Items:**
   - Give item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
   - Give item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
   - Give item 3 to Agent 1 (second-highest value for Agent 1).

2. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Give item 5 to Agent 2 (second-highest value for Agent 2).
   - Give item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest for Agent 1).
   - Give item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest for Agent 0).
   - Give item 4 to Agent 0 (remaining item).

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 6
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent a set of items that they value reasonably, while trying to minimize envy. Note that achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations is not always possible, but the above solution aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints.
