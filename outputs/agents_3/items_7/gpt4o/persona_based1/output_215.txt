Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  38  30  65  28  63  82
1  51  18  79  42  40  32  87
2  89  26  17  52  30   3  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we will use an envy-free allocation approach, ensuring that each agent receives items such that no agent envies another based on their respective valuations.

We start by considering the highest valuations for each item and try to distribute them in a manner that reduces envy and tries to balance the total value each agent receives. After reviewing the given valuations, here's a possible envy-free allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0, who has the highest valuation for it.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1, who values it the most.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0, who values it highly.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 to increase their total value.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0 to balance the allocation.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2, who has a high valuation for it.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives and minimizes envy. Below is the allocation in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 6]
}
```
