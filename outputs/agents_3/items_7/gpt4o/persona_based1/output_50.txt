Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  68  37  89  71   6  95
1   8   0  71  23  91  61  13
2  15   7  57  34  55  19  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We will use the following approach:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 6 highly (95).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 highly (91).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 highly (57).

2. **Assign the Highest Valued Items**: 
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0: After item 6, Agent 0 highly values items 3 (89), 1 (68), and 4 (71). Item 4 is already given to Agent 1. Assign item 3 and 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: After item 4, Agent 1's next highest valued items are 2 (71), 5 (61), and 6 (13). Item 2 is already given to Agent 2, and item 6 to Agent 0. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2: After item 2, Agent 2 values item 6 (42), 4 (55), and 3 (34). Item 6 is already given to Agent 0, item 4 to Agent 1, and item 3 to Agent 0. Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Final Check and Adjustments**:
   - Ensure all items are allocated and the allocation is envy-free or as close as possible.

Based on the above logic, the allocation of items is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on the agents' valuations, ensuring each agent gets items they highly value, thus minimizing envy.
