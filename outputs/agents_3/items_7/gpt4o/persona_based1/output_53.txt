Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73   7  30  42  52  29  29
1   2  79   6  32  11  85  13
2  89  90  87  95  29  57  29
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[73  7 30 42 52 29 29]
 [ 2 79  6 32 11 85 13]
 [89 90 87 95 29 57 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that seeks to minimize envy, we will use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation of their assigned items. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly while aiming to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible.

The valuation matrix is as follows:
- Agent 0: [73, 7, 30, 42, 52, 29, 29]
- Agent 1: [2, 79, 6, 32, 11, 85, 13]
- Agent 2: [89, 90, 87, 95, 29, 57, 29]

First, let's calculate the total value each agent would get if they chose their most valued items:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (73), followed by item 4 (52), then item 3 (42).
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the most (85), followed by item 1 (79), then item 3 (32).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (95), followed by item 1 (90), then item 2 (87).

Using a greedy approach, let's allocate items based on the highest values:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (next highest for Agent 2).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (next highest for Agent 2).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (next highest for Agent 0).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for Agent 1).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (next highest for Agent 1).

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 2, 3]

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
