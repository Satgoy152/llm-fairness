Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  60  94  11  29  67  59
1  21  79  88  58   1  34  59
2  65  16  15  38  72  25  15
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the three agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation while attempting to achieve envy-freeness. Given the valuations, we aim to allocate the items in a way that each agent feels they received a fair share.

Let's first consider the total valuations for each agent and look for potential allocations:

Agent 0's valuations: [0, 60, 94, 11, 29, 67, 59]
Agent 1's valuations: [21, 79, 88, 58, 1, 34, 59]
Agent 2's valuations: [65, 16, 15, 38, 72, 25, 15]

One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, aiming to maximize each agent's satisfaction. Let's apply this heuristic:

1. Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 2 (65).
2. Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 0 (60).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 0 (94).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 1 (58).
5. Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 2 (72).
6. Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 0 (67).
7. Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 1 (59).

Now, let's allocate the items based on this approach:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 6.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4.

This allocation is based on maximizing each agent's valuation per item, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
