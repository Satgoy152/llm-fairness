Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  84  85  48  65  22  26
1  39  33  15   8  81   2  45
2   5   5  75  91  51  11  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. To maximize their satisfaction, let's assign these items to Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 highly. Let's assign this item to Agent 1. Additionally, item 6 has a relatively high value for Agent 1 compared to Agent 2. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 as well.

3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 3 and 2. Since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can assign item 3 to Agent 2. Additionally, item 5 is of relatively low value to both Agents 0 and 1, so it can be allocated to Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to maximize the total perceived value for each agent while minimizing envy. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

In this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 4, 6.
- Agent 2 receives items 3, 5. 

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated and tries to respect the preferences of each agent as much as possible.
