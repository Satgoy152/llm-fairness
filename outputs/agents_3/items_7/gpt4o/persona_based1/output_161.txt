Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  87  70  93  41  51  95
1  90  93  65  25  52  16  77
2  26  50  87  72   1   2  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent prefers their own allocation over any other agent's allocation based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 49     | 87     | 70     | 93     | 41     | 51     | 95     |
| 1     | 90     | 93     | 65     | 25     | 52     | 16     | 77     |
| 2     | 26     | 50     | 87     | 72     | 1      | 2      | 34     |

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 0 and 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2.

Following these observations, we can allocate the items as follows, aiming to balance the total value for each agent:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 1 (Value: 87)
  - Item 3 (Value: 93)
  
- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0 (Value: 90)
  - Item 6 (Value: 77)
  - Item 5 (Value: 16)
  
- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 2 (Value: 87)
  - Item 4 (Value: 1)

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 6, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This ensures all 7 items are allocated among the 3 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
