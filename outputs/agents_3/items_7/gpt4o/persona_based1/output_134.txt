Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  53   0  18  97  63  21
1  90  60  61  21  54   8  65
2  38  83  49   5  45  52   9
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[75 53  0 18 97 63 21]
 [90 60 61 21 54  8 65]
 [38 83 49  5 45 52  9]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items such that they do not feel envious of others. We can approach this problem by attempting to maximize the total valuation for each agent while considering the envy-freeness condition.

First, let's summarize the agent's valuations for each item:

- Agent 0 values: [75, 53, 0, 18, 97, 63, 21]
- Agent 1 values: [90, 60, 61, 21, 54, 8, 65]
- Agent 2 values: [38, 83, 49, 5, 45, 52, 9]

Now, we can try to assign items in a manner that maximizes each agent's happiness while ensuring that everyone gets at least one item and no one feels envious.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 5] (Values: 75, 63)
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 6] (Values: 60, 61, 65)
- Agent 2: [3, 4] (Values: 5, 45)

This allocation is designed to maximize the total valuation for each agent while aiming for fair division.

Now, presenting this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
