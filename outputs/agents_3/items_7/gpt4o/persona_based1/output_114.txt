Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  71  98  65  80  93  61
1  37  78  60  89  45  32  45
2  85  60  84  83  21  61  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [85 60 84 83 21 61 61]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we will aim to achieve an envy-free division, if possible, by considering the valuations provided by each agent. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent based on their own valuations.

### Steps to ensure fair allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent values items differently, with some items being more valuable to certain agents.
   - The total number of items is 7, which must be divided among 3 agents, so some agents may receive more items than others.

2. **Valuation Analysis:**
   - **Agent 0:** Has the highest valuations for items 0, 2, and 5.
   - **Agent 1:** Has the highest valuation for item 3.
   - **Agent 2:** Has relatively balanced valuations but the highest for item 4.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - We will start by allocating items that have the highest unique valuation to a single agent, to minimize envy.
   - Remaining items will be distributed to balance the total value as much as possible across agents.

4. **Initial Allocation:**
   - **Agent 0:** Items 0, 2 (highest valuation for these items).
   - **Agent 1:** Item 3 (highest valuation for this item).
   - **Agent 2:** Item 4 (relatively highest valuation by Agent 2).

5. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items: 1, 5, 6 need to be allocated.
   - Given Agent 0 already has two items with high valuations, we aim to balance the overall value.

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0, as it gives them high value and balances their overall allocation.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 has high valuation for it, and it balances their total value.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2, which provides value and balances their allocation.

7. **Check for envy-freeness:** 
   - Each agent should not prefer the allocations of others based on their valuations.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items in a manner that reflects each agent's preferences, aiming to achieve a fair division by minimizing potential envy among agents.
