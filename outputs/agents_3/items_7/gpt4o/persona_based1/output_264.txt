Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  34  44   4  21  25  56
1  99  90  19  48  78  39  51
2  86  77  35  22  83  85  39
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the three agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel they received as much value as they could expect compared to any other agent's allocation. We'll use a simple algorithm to distribute items to balance the perceived fairness among the agents, aiming for each agent to get an approximately equal share of the total value.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 80 + 34 + 44 + 4 + 21 + 25 + 56 = 264
- Agent 1: 99 + 90 + 19 + 48 + 78 + 39 + 51 = 424
- Agent 2: 86 + 77 + 35 + 22 + 83 + 85 + 39 = 427

The total value of all items is 264 + 424 + 427 = 1115, and ideally, each agent should receive approximately 1115/3 = 371.67 in value.

Now, let's allocate the items by selecting them to maximize each agent's perceived value, while trying to keep their total close to 371.67.

1. **Agent 1**: Given the high total valuation, let's allocate high-value items to Agent 1 first to reach their fair value:
   - Item 0: 99 (highest value for Agent 1)
   - Item 1: 90
   - Item 4: 78
   - Total for Agent 1: 99 + 90 + 78 = 267

2. **Agent 2**: Allocate items to Agent 2:
   - Item 5: 85
   - Item 6: 39
   - Item 2: 35
   - Item 4: 83 (already assigned to Agent 1, so we skip it)
   - Total for Agent 2: 85 + 39 + 35 = 159

3. **Agent 0**: Allocate remaining items to Agent 0:
   - Item 3: 4 (least valued but still needs to be allocated)
   - Item 4: 21 (already assigned to Agent 1, so we skip it)

Adjusting allocations for balance:

- Move Item 4 to Agent 2 to increase their total:
  - Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
  - Agent 2: Items [4, 5, 6]
  - Agent 0: Items [2, 3]

Recalculate totals:
- Agent 1: 99 + 90 = 189
- Agent 2: 83 + 85 + 39 = 207
- Agent 0: 44 + 4 = 48

To ensure allocations adhere to the requirement of assigning all items, let's redistribute:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 5, 6]

Final allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total perceived value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.
