Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  37  14  57  76  72  65
1  50  45  44  49  81  89  94
2  36  45  85  15  48  99  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair compared to others. One way to achieve this is by maximizing the minimum satisfaction of each agent, which can be measured by minimizing envy or maximizing utility given the constraints.

Let's consider the preference and value each agent has for the items:

1. **Agent 0** has highest valuations for items 4, 5, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** has highest valuations for items 5, 6, and 4.
3. **Agent 2** has highest valuations for items 5, 2, and 6.

Based on the valuation table provided:

1. **Agent 0** values items 4 (76), 5 (72), and 6 (65) highly.
2. **Agent 1** values items 6 (94), 5 (89), and 4 (81) highly.
3. **Agent 2** values items 5 (99), 2 (85), and 6 (55) highly.

To achieve fairness, we should try to allocate high-value items to agents who value them the most, while also ensuring each agent receives at least two items, given the total of 7 items.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0, 3
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 4, 6
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 1, 2, 5

This allocation ensures that:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (22) and item 3 (57), totaling 79 in value.
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (81) and item 6 (94), totaling 175 in value.
- Agent 2 gets item 1 (45), item 2 (85), and item 5 (99), totaling 229 in value.

This distribution attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives, given their preferences.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation results in each agent receiving a fair share of items based on their valuations, satisfying the fairness criterion as much as possible given the constraints.
