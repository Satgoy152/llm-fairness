Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  78  47   0   3  78  54
1  61   3  44  83  33  67  17
2   6  76   8  47  46  53  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the three agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we will consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that minimizes envy and distributes the total value as evenly as possible among the agents.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**:  
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 61.

2. **Item 1**:  
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 78.

3. **Item 2**:  
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 47.

4. **Item 3**:  
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 83.

5. **Item 4**:  
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 46.

6. **Item 5**:  
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 78.

7. **Item 6**:  
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 54.

Next, we will consider the distribution of items to balance the allocations:

- Agent 0 has received items 1, 2, 5, and 6.
- Agent 1 has received items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 has received item 4.

To balance the allocation more fairly, we may need to adjust it by reallocating some items:

- Transfer item 6 from Agent 0 to Agent 2, since Agent 2 values it at 51, which is relatively high for them.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 6]

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives, considering each agent's valuation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
