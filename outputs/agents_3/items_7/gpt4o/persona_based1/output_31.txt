Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  92   5  28  99  31  41
1  41  92  16   6  38  76   4
2  14  22  71  21  62  77  89
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we'll aim to allocate the 7 items among the 3 agents such that the allocation is as fair as possible. One common fairness criterion is envy-freeness, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

Here's one way to approach the problem:

1. **Total Value Calculation**: First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their preferences.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Start by giving each agent their most valued item, ensuring no two agents get the same item.

3. **Iterative Allocation**: Continue allocating items one by one to the agent who values the remaining unallocated items the most, trying to maintain a balanced allocation.

Let's calculate and allocate:

### Total Valuations

- Agent 0: 33 + 92 + 5 + 28 + 99 + 31 + 41 = 329
- Agent 1: 41 + 92 + 16 + 6 + 38 + 76 + 4 = 273
- Agent 2: 14 + 22 + 71 + 21 + 62 + 77 + 89 = 356

### Allocation Process

1. **Initial Allocation**: Assign the highest valued unallocated item to each agent one by one:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 4 (99).
   - Agent 1 gets Item 1 (92).
   - Agent 2 gets Item 6 (89).

2. **Second Allocation**: Assign the next highest valued unallocated item to maintain balance:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 0 (33).
   - Agent 1 gets Item 5 (76).
   - Agent 2 gets Item 2 (71).

3. **Final Allocation**: Allocate the remaining items:
   - Item 3 (28) is least valued by Agent 1 but better for balance.
   
Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 0]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [6, 2]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some of their higher-valued items, and the total number of items is correctly distributed.

### Final Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [1, 5, 3],
    "2": [6, 2]
}
```
