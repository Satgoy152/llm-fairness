Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  89  24  56  55  87  37
1  62  79  33  31  65  88  35
2  26  61  80  60  44  50  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute them in a way that minimizes envy. A common approach is to use the "envy-free up to one item" (EF1) criterion, which may not completely eliminate envy but ensures that any envy can be eliminated by removing a single item from another agent's allocation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to find a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** 
   Identify which items are valued highly by each agent. This will help in minimizing potential envy.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   Start by allocating items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent initially gets at least one item.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   Balance the allocations to ensure no agent feels significantly disadvantaged. This may involve reallocating items to achieve better balance.

Let's consider the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (89).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (88).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (90).

Starting allocations based on highest valuations:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

Now, distribute the remaining items:

- Agent 0: Assign item 3 (second highest value for Agent 0).
- Agent 1: Assign item 0 (second highest value for Agent 1).
- Agent 2: Assign item 2 (second highest value for Agent 2).

Now, distribute the remaining items 4 and 7:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (third highest value).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (third highest value).

Final allocation with each agent getting at least two items:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [6, 2, 0]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while attempting to minimize envy.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [6, 2, 0]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the agents fairly based on their valuations.
