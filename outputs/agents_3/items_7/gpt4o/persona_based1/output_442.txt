Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  39  48   1  83  47  18
1  52  44  19  60  48  42  52
2  25  64  34  29  21  60  16
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to ensure that the distribution is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations. Here, we will attempt to allocate items to minimize envy and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations and the distribution process:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** Agent 0 values item 4 the most at 83, followed by item 0 at 76. The other items have significantly lower valuations.

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 60, followed by a tie between items 0 and 6, both valued at 52.

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:** Agent 2 values item 1 the most at 64, followed by item 5 at 60.

Given these valuations, a possible envy-free allocation strategy is to assign each agent items based on their highest valuations while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation. Here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:** To maximize their satisfaction, assign them item 4 (value 83) and item 0 (value 76). This allocation uses Agent 0's top two valued items.

- **Agent 1:** Assign them item 3 (value 60) and item 6 (value 52). These are among the highest valued items for Agent 1.

- **Agent 2:** Assign them item 1 (value 64), item 2 (value 34), and item 5 (value 60). This takes advantage of their highest valued items.

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, reducing the likelihood of envy. Each agent receives a different number of items, but the allocation aims to maximize individual satisfaction based on their unique valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the requirement of allocating all 7 items while attempting to maintain fairness and minimize envy.
