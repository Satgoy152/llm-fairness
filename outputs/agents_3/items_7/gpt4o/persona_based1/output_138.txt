Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54   9  60  80  96  20  54
1  28  76  94  11  72  57  36
2  17  61  32  62  38  67  97
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[54  9 60 80 96 20 54]
 [28 76 94 11 72 57 36]
 [17 61 32 62 38 67 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim for a distribution that is envy-free or at least minimizes envy as much as possible. Given that there are 3 agents and 7 items, each agent should ideally receive 2-3 items. We will try to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring everyone gets items they value.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [54, 9, 60, 80, 96, 20, 54]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [28, 76, 94, 11, 72, 57, 36]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [17, 61, 32, 62, 38, 67, 97]

To minimize envy, we will focus on giving each agent some of their highest-valued items while ensuring everyone receives a fair share.

### Allocation Plan:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: Item 4 (96), Item 3 (80)
   - Additional allocation: Item 0 (54) to balance distribution

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: Item 2 (94), Item 1 (76)
   - Additional allocation: Item 5 (57) to balance distribution

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: Item 6 (97), Item 5 (67)
   - Additional allocation: None needed as items are already distributed

Therefore, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items [4, 3, 0]
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 1]
- Agent 2 receives items [6, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share of their most valued items, thereby minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3, 0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [6, 5]
}
```
