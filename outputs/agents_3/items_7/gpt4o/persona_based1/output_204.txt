Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  20  60  58  89  61  37
1  77  30  34  73  77  72  90
2  58  14  38  21  84  18   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the three agents, we aim to ensure envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations. Given the valuation table, we will analyze potential allocations that maximize each agent's total value while maintaining fairness.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 90 + 20 + 60 + 58 + 89 + 61 + 37 = 415
- Agent 1: 77 + 30 + 34 + 73 + 77 + 72 + 90 = 453
- Agent 2: 58 + 14 + 38 + 21 + 84 + 18 + 6 = 239

Given these valuations, we aim to assign items to agents such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible, while ensuring envy-freeness.

One possible allocation strategy is to assign each agent items that give them the highest values while maintaining a balanced distribution. Let's start by assigning items as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 0: 90 (highest value for Agent 0)
   - Item 4: 89 (second highest value for Agent 0)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 6: 90 (highest value for Agent 1)
   - Item 3: 73 (second highest value for Agent 1)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4: 84 (highest value for Agent 2, but already allocated to Agent 0, so skip)
   - Item 5: 18 (next highest value for Agent 2)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Already has items 0 and 4

- **Agent 1**:
  - Already has items 6 and 3

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Needs more items; let's assign:
  - Item 2: 38 (highest remaining value for Agent 2)

Finally, allocate the remaining items to balance the number of items:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 1: 20 (next highest remaining value for Agent 0)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 4 was re-allocated, so assign:
  - Item 5: 18 (already allocated to Agent 2, skip)
  - Item 6: 6 (already allocated to Agent 1, skip)
  - Assign remaining item 3 to Agent 0 to balance the allocation

This gives us a final allocation:

Agent 0: Items 0, 1
Agent 1: Items 3, 6
Agent 2: Items 2, 5

Re-evaluate and adjust to ensure all items are allocated and agents are fairly treated:

Let's re-evaluate based on the re-allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0, 1
   - Total Value: 90 + 20 = 110

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 3, 6
   - Total Value: 73 + 90 = 163

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 2, 5
   - Total Value: 38 + 18 = 56

To balance, let's use:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 2 (values: 90, 20, 60)
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 6 (values: 73, 90)
- **Agent 2**: Items 4, 5 (values: 84, 18)

Re-calculated total values:

- Agent 0: 90 + 20 + 60 = 170
- Agent 1: 73 + 90 = 163
- Agent 2: 84 + 18 = 102

This allocation provides a more balanced approach with respect to the values and number of items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
