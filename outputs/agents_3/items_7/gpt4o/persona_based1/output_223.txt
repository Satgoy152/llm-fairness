Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  30  82  51   1   6  76
1  86  55  60  30  32  94   8
2  92  75  28  41  51   6  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [92 75 28 41 51  6 28]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible given the valuations. A common method for achieving this is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, where no agent should envy another agent after possibly removing one item from the other agent's allocation.

Given the valuations, let's proceed to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations**: Item 2 (82) and Item 6 (76).
2. **Agent 1's highest valuations**: Item 5 (94) and Item 0 (86).
3. **Agent 2's highest valuations**: Item 0 (92) and Item 1 (75).

We need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value as per their valuations:

- Total value for each agent:  
  - Agent 0: 39 + 30 + 82 + 51 + 1 + 6 + 76 = 285
  - Agent 1: 86 + 55 + 60 + 30 + 32 + 94 + 8 = 365
  - Agent 2: 92 + 75 + 28 + 41 + 51 + 6 + 28 = 321

- Total value of all items: 285 + 365 + 321 = 971
- Fair share for each agent: 971 / 3 â‰ˆ 324

Allocating items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2 (82) and 6 (76) = 158
- **Agent 1**: Items 5 (94) and 0 (86) = 180
- **Agent 2**: Item 1 (75), Item 3 (41), and Item 4 (51) = 167

Now, let's ensure the allocations sum to all 7 items:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 0]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 3, 4]

This allocation provides a relatively balanced distribution of high-valued items according to each agent's preference, and it respects the total allocation constraint.

The allocations in the requested JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
