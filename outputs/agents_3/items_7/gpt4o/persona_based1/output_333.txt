Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  91   7  87  90  65  95
1  61  18  55  35  97  63  69
2  63  30  23  66  38  74  16
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a fair manner, we will try to ensure that each agent feels they have a fair share of the total valuation. We aim for an envy-free distribution where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. 

Here’s a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair division:

1. **Total Valuation Calculation**: Calculate each agent's total valuation of all items.
   - Agent 0: 79 + 91 + 7 + 87 + 90 + 65 + 95 = 514
   - Agent 1: 61 + 18 + 55 + 35 + 97 + 63 + 69 = 398
   - Agent 2: 63 + 30 + 23 + 66 + 38 + 74 + 16 = 310

2. **Fair Share Calculation**: Divide the total valuation by the number of items to determine the fair share for each item.
   - Total sum of valuations for all items by all agents: 514 + 398 + 310 = 1222
   - Fair share per item = 1222 / 7 ≈ 174.57

3. **Initial Allocation Strategy**: Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation first, ensuring no agent receives more than their fair share.

4. **Iterative Adjustment**: Adjust allocations to balance the total value each agent receives, aiming for envy-freeness.

Based on this approach, here is one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 3, 4]
  - Valuation: 79 + 87 + 90 = 256

- **Agent 1**: Items [5, 6]
  - Valuation: 63 + 69 = 132

- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 2]
  - Valuation: 30 + 23 = 53

This allocation gives each agent their fair share, or as close as possible, without exceeding the total valuation each agent can expect from a fair distribution. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
