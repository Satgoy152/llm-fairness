Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60   7  52  40  24  13  12
1  28   1  21  15  51  85  83
2  83  80  21  67  54  80  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [28  1 21 15 51 85 83]
 [83 80 21 67 54 80 75]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels that their allocation is as good as any other agent's allocation, based on their own valuation. Given the constraints, a possible allocation strategy is to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

### Valuation Table

```
         0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agent 0: 60   7  52  40  24  13  12
Agent 1: 28   1  21  15  51  85  83
Agent 2: 83  80  21  67  54  80  75
```

### Steps for Allocation
1. **Identify Items with Highest Valuation for Each Agent:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most, but since item 0 provides higher relative value to Agent 0, the next highest is item 1.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: [2, 3, 4, 6]
   - Allocate items to maximize individual agent valuations and ensure envy-freeness.

4. **Allocation Strategy for Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 2 is the best fit for item 6 (value 75).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 1 has a high preference for item 4 (value 51).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3, which are still relatively high in their valuation.

### Final Allocation:
The allocation strategy should ensure all 7 items are distributed among the agents with consideration to maximizing each agent's valuation based on their preferences.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share of items while considering their individual valuations, aiming to minimize envy among agents.
