Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  71  91  38  57  29  37
1  96  26  76  58   2  45  50
2  64   2  40  19  82  46  40
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[10 71 91 38 57 29 37]
 [96 26 76 58  2 45 50]
 [64  2 40 19 82 46 40]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation among the three agents (0, 1, and 2) for the seven items, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which means no agent should prefer the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations, a common approach is to find a way to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is as balanced as possible. Let's try to assign items to minimize envy:

Let's begin by analyzing preferences:

- **Agent 0** values: 10, 71, 91, 38, 57, 29, 37
- **Agent 1** values: 96, 26, 76, 58, 2, 45, 50
- **Agent 2** values: 64, 2, 40, 19, 82, 46, 40

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize high value items 2 (91), 1 (71), and 4 (57).
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize high value items 0 (96), 2 (76).
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize high value items 4 (82), 5 (46).

### Allocate Items

- **Agent 0** gets items: 2, 1, 6
  - Total Value for Agent 0: 91 + 71 + 37 = 199
- **Agent 1** gets items: 0, 3
  - Total Value for Agent 1: 96 + 58 = 154
- **Agent 2** gets items: 4, 5
  - Total Value for Agent 2: 82 + 46 = 128

This allocation aims to provide each agent with a high total valuation while ensuring that envy is minimized. The total number of items allocated is 7, which satisfies the requirement.

### Final JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
