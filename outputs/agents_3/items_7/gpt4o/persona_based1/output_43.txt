Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  62  15  84  97  50  58
1  99  41  40  44  10  14  41
2  14  59  67   3  25  43  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55 62 15 84 97 50 58]
 [99 41 40 44 10 14 41]
 [14 59 67  3 25 43 11]]
Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we aim to find an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations table:

```
Agent 0: [55, 62, 15, 84, 97, 50, 58]
Agent 1: [99, 41, 40, 44, 10, 14, 41]
Agent 2: [14, 59, 67, 3, 25, 43, 11]
```

We'll proceed by trying to balance the total value each agent receives from their allocated items:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 3 and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 0, and moderate valuations for items 2 and 6.
3. **Agent 2**: Seems to value item 2 the most and has moderate interest in item 1 and 5.

A possible fair allocation approach might be:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items with high valuations, such as [3, 4].
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items such as [0, 6].
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items such as [1, 2, 5].

Now, let's verify:

- **Agent 0's** total value: 84 (item 3) + 97 (item 4) = 181
- **Agent 1's** total value: 99 (item 0) + 41 (item 6) = 140
- **Agent 2's** total value: 59 (item 1) + 67 (item 2) + 43 (item 5) = 169

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations and is not envious of each other as each agent ends up with a set of items they highly value.

The allocation is as follows in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
