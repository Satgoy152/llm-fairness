Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22   2  27  33  19  73   5
1  42  19   4  21  10  35   2
2  13   3   0  62  90  67  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what they would get by swapping with another agent, based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's highest valuations are for items 5 (73), 3 (33), and 2 (27).
- Agent 1's highest valuations are for items 0 (42), 5 (35), and 3 (21).
- Agent 2's highest valuations are for items 4 (90), 3 (62), and 5 (67).

A potential allocation strategy could involve assigning each agent some of their highest-valued items while ensuring all items are allocated. We will try to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 5 (73) (highest value) and item 2 (27).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 0 (42) and item 1 (19).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 4 (90), item 3 (62), and item 6 (11).

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent gets a substantial part of their highest-valued items, and all items are distributed:

- Agent 0 receives items [5, 2], total valuation: 73 + 27 = 100.
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 1], total valuation: 42 + 19 = 61.
- Agent 2 receives items [4, 3, 6], total valuation: 90 + 62 + 11 = 163.

Despite the distribution differences, this allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, making it a fair division under these constraints.
