Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  10  70  38  30   0  64
1  71  94  41  14  37  95  42
2  74  14   2  64  54  52  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or ensuring envy-freeness. Given the valuation matrix, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent envies the allocation of another agent.

Here's a step-by-step approach to fairly allocate the items:

1. **Calculate the Total Valuation for Each Agent:**  
   Each agent's total valuation can be calculated by summing up their valuations for all items. However, since we want each agent to feel they have a fair share, we'll focus on maximizing the minimum valuation received by each agent from the items they get.

2. **Determine a Fair Allocation:**
   We'll try to allocate the items so that the least satisfied agent has the highest possible satisfaction. This can be achieved through manual inspection or by using an algorithmic approach to attempt maximizing the minimum valuation.

3. **Assign Items to Agents:**
   By checking the valuations, assign each item to the agent that values it most while ensuring that the overall allocation remains fair.

### Allocation Steps:

- **Agent 0:**  
  Highest values are for items 2 and 6. Assign these items to Agent 0.
  
- **Agent 1:**  
  Highest values are for items 1 and 5. Assign these items to Agent 1.
  
- **Agent 2:**  
  Highest values are for items 0, 3, and 4. Assign these items to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation is done with the intention to balance the valuations among agents and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items.
