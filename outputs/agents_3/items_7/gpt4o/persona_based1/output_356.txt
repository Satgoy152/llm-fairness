Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  94  64  50   4  22  68
1  98  33   1  75  99   5  47
2  10  86  66  36  83  63  54
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute them such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

One possible approach is to use a well-known fair division algorithm, such as the adjusted winner procedure, but due to the small number of agents and items, a heuristic approach can also be effectively used.

Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for items 0, 1, and 6. 
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 0, 3, and 4.
3. **Agent 2** places high value on items 1, 4, 5, and 6.

Considering these preferences, one possible way to allocate the items is:

- **Agent 0** receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring other agents can also receive items they value. Items 0 and 6 are highly valued by Agent 0.

- **Agent 1** should get items that are valuable to them but not as much to others. Items 3 and 4 are not highly valued by the other agents.

- **Agent 2** can be given items that they value more compared to the others. Items 1, 2, and 5 can be allocated to Agent 2 as they have relatively high valuations for them.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

In this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 6, which they value the most.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4, which are among the highest valued by them compared to others.
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 2, and 5, ensuring they get items of significant value to them.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7, as required.
