Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  66  84  47  81  73  68
1  76  40  52  67  62  79  64
2  70  35  97  96  19  32  97
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[49 66 84 47 81 73 68]
 [76 40 52 67 62 79 64]
 [70 35 97 96 19 32 97]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. One popular method for achieving a fair allocation is the "Envy-Free" method. This involves allocating the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

1. Agent 0 values the items as follows: [49, 66, 84, 47, 81, 73, 68]
2. Agent 1 values the items as follows: [76, 40, 52, 67, 62, 79, 64]
3. Agent 2 values the items as follows: [70, 35, 97, 96, 19, 32, 97]

We will try to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Items with the highest values are 2 (84), 4 (81), and 5 (73).
- **Agent 1**: Items with the highest values are 0 (76), 5 (79), and 3 (67).
- **Agent 2**: Items with the highest values are 2 (97), 3 (96), and 6 (97).

To distribute the items fairly while considering envy-freeness:

- **Agent 0**: Give items 0 and 1. This gives them a combined value of 49 + 66 = 115.
- **Agent 1**: Give item 4 and 5. This gives them a combined value of 62 + 79 = 141.
- **Agent 2**: Give items 2, 3, and 6. This gives them a combined value of 97 + 96 + 97 = 290.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that respects their valuation preferences as closely as possible, aiming for an envy-free distribution. Each agent receives a non-zero number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.
