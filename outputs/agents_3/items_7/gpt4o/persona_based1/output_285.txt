Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  21  92  77  82  12  80
1  10  94  98  27  29  13  24
2  20  38  11  89  27  75  97
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[58 21 92 77 82 12 80]

 [20 38 11 89 27 75 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Seeking an envy-free allocation can be challenging, but we will aim to minimize envy.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \( 58 + 21 + 92 + 77 + 82 + 12 + 80 = 422 \)
- Agent 1: \( 10 + 94 + 98 + 27 + 29 + 13 + 24 = 295 \)
- Agent 2: \( 20 + 38 + 11 + 89 + 27 + 75 + 97 = 357 \)

We will try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's share of their total valuation.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with the highest valuation for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with the highest valuation for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items with the highest valuation for Agent 2.

### Allocation Process
- **Agent 0**'s highest valued items: 2 (92), 4 (82), 3 (77), 6 (80)
- **Agent 1**'s highest valued items: 2 (98), 1 (94)
- **Agent 2**'s highest valued items: 6 (97), 5 (75), 3 (89)

We'll aim to distribute the items to minimize envy:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
2. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation).
5. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation).
6. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest for Agent 0).
7. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest for Agent 0).

### Final Allocation
- **Agent 0**: Items 4, 0, 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 1
- **Agent 2**: Items 6, 5

This distribution aims to maximize overall satisfaction per agent based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 3],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [6, 5]
}
```
