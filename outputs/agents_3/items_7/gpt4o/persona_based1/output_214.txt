Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  87  59  82  65  56  53
1  40  59  99  87   6  91   8
2  37  64  83  96   9  63  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve the fair division problem and ensure envy-freeness, we aim to allocate the items to the agents such that each agent receives a set of items with a total valuation that is as close as possible to each other, according to their own valuations. We need to ensure that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [50, 87, 59, 82, 65, 56, 53]
- Agent 1 values: [40, 59, 99, 87, 6, 91, 8]
- Agent 2 values: [37, 64, 83, 96, 9, 63, 93]

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 452
- Agent 1 total valuation: 390
- Agent 2 total valuation: 445

To ensure fairness, we can attempt to distribute items so that the value each agent receives is as close to each other as possible, according to the agents' own valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2: 
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (96).

2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (99).

3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (87).

4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 5 highly (91).

5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 (65) higher than the others.

6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2:
   - Agent 2 values item 6 highly (93).

7. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 (50).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share and that no agent has a higher valuation than another for the items allocated to them.

Now, the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with a set of items that respects their preferences as closely as possible given the constraints.
