Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  51  43  77   8  76   1
1  54  22  13   3  74  99  40
2  66  79  54   4  23   9  97
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy, ensuring that each agent receives a subset of items that they value highly. The goal is to allocate all 7 items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and ideally, each agent feels satisfied with their bundle relative to what others receive.

To achieve this, we can use the following strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and try to balance the total value each agent receives.
2. Allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction and minimizes envy by considering individual item valuations.

Here's one possible allocation that attempts to balance the total value received by each agent and minimize envy:

- Agent 0 seems to value item 3 and item 1 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 5 and item 4 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 6 and item 1 highly.

Assigning items based on high valuations and attempting to balance total values:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 5 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 6, 1, and 2.

Let's check the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0: 77 (item 3) + 22 (item 0) = 99
- Agent 1: 99 (item 5) + 74 (item 4) = 173
- Agent 2: 97 (item 6) + 79 (item 1) + 54 (item 2) = 230

The allocation tries to balance the values and uses each agent's high-value items. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [6, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
