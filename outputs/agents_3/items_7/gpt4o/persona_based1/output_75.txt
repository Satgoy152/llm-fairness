Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  75  98  99  98  91   3
1  37  39  96  63  70  94  44
2  93  93  37  69  94  80  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents (0, 1, and 2), we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness, which means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**:
    - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 99. 
    - Additionally, item 2 and item 4 have high values of 98 for agent 0.
    
2. **Agent 1**:
    - Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 94.
    - We also observe that item 2 is highly valued at 96, but it is already allocated to agent 0.
    
3. **Agent 2**:
    - Agent 2 values item 0 and item 1 the highest at 93 each.
    - Agent 2 also values item 4 highly, but item 4 is already allocated to agent 0.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 3, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 5, 6
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 1

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items that are valued relatively high by them, and no agent feels strongly envious of another agent's allocation based on the given valuations. 

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
