Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  88  12   3  28   0  36
1  72  43  79  91  39  30  80
2   2  61  79  14  24  96  84
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as those of the others. Given the valuations provided, we can use a heuristic approach to assign items to agents.

Let's examine the agents' valuations and allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: Has a high valuation for item 1 (88) and moderate for item 0 (41). 
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 3 (91) and 2 (79).
3. **Agent 2**: Has a high valuation for item 5 (96) and item 6 (84).

Based on these observations, we can make the following allocations:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued by them.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it is their most valued item.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as it is their most valued item.

Next, we consider the remaining items and their valuations:

- For item 0:
  - Agent 0 values it at 41.
  - Agent 1 values it at 72.
  - Agent 2 values it at 2.

Item 0 should go to Agent 1 because they value it more than others.

- For item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 12.
  - Agent 1 values it at 79.
  - Agent 2 values it at 79.

Item 2 can be allocated to Agent 2, who values it equally as Agent 1.

- For item 4:
  - Agent 0 values it at 28.
  - Agent 1 values it at 39.
  - Agent 2 values it at 24.

Item 4 should go to Agent 1, as they value it the most.

- For item 6:
  - Agent 0 values it at 36.
  - Agent 1 values it at 80.
  - Agent 2 values it at 84.

Item 6 should go to Agent 2, as it is their second most valued item.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is relatively balanced based on the agents' preferences.
