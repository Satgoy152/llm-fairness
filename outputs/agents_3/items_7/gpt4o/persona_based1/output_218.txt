Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  52  38  81  66  48  14
1   5  28  40  32  82  86  82
2  52  97  12  20  41  79  81
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[39 52 38 81 66 48 14]
 [ 5 28 40 32 82 86 82]
 [52 97 12 20 41 79 81]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value received by each agent while ensuring that the allocations are envy-free, if possible. An envy-free allocation implies that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

The valuations are given as follows:

- Agent 0: [39, 52, 38, 81, 66, 48, 14]
- Agent 1: [5, 28, 40, 32, 82, 86, 82]
- Agent 2: [52, 97, 12, 20, 41, 79, 81]

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (97). Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (81). Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (86). Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (82). Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (82). Assign Item 6 to Agent 1.
6. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (52). Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
7. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (40). Since Agent 1 already has a significant allocation, we can consider another agent to balance the allocations better. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

After this allocation, let's check the total value for each agent:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 2] → Values [81, 38] → Total Value = 119
- Agent 1: Items [5, 4, 6] → Values [86, 82, 82] → Total Value = 250
- Agent 2: Items [1, 0] → Values [97, 52] → Total Value = 149

This allocation attempts to balance the total values and distribute items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives a fair share.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [5, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```
