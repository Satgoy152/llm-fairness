Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  34  62  45  13   0  28
1  88  82  37  93  75  95  39
2  81  61  86  32  70  95  53
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 34 62 45 13  0 28]
 [88 82 37 93 75 95 39]
 [81 61 86 32 70 95 53]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy, if possible. One approach to achieve this is to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, ensuring a balanced distribution.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [65, 34, 62, 45, 13, 0, 28]
- Agent 1: [88, 82, 37, 93, 75, 95, 39]
- Agent 2: [81, 61, 86, 32, 70, 95, 53]

Let's attempt to allocate these items to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring no agent is unduly envious of another, given the constraints.

A possible allocation could be:

1. **Agent 0** prefers item 0 (value 65), item 2 (value 62), and item 3 (value 45).
2. **Agent 1** prefers item 5 (value 95), item 3 (value 93), and item 1 (value 82).
3. **Agent 2** prefers item 5 (value 95), item 2 (value 86), and item 0 (value 81).

To resolve conflicts and ensure each item is only allocated once, we assign as follows:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 65), item 2 to Agent 2 (value 86), and item 5 to Agent 1 (value 95).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 82), item 3 to Agent 1 (value 93), and item 4 to Agent 2 (value 70).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 28).

This allocation ensures each agent receives a reasonable total valuation and attempts to minimize envy:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 6] with a total value of 65 + 28 = 93.
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 3, 5] with a total value of 82 + 93 + 95 = 270.
- Agent 2 receives items [2, 4] with a total value of 86 + 70 = 156.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
