Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  77  49  63  25   1  55
1  33  19  79  86  28   2  16
2  11  34  58  48  54  49  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use a method that aims to balance the perceived value of the items each agent receives. One common approach is to try to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, also known as the "maximin" strategy. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 1 highly (77), item 3 (63), and item 6 (55).
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 2 (79) and item 3 (86).
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 6 (83) and item 4 (54).

Given these preferences, we can attempt to allocate the items to maximize the total value each agent perceives, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items [0, 1, 6]
  - Value: 39 (item 0) + 77 (item 1) + 55 (item 6) = 171
- **Agent 1**: Assign items [2, 3]
  - Value: 79 (item 2) + 86 (item 3) = 165
- **Agent 2**: Assign items [4, 5]
  - Value: 54 (item 4) + 49 (item 5) = 103

This allocation attempts to balance the value each agent receives based on their individual preferences for the items. The total number of items allocated is 7, which is correct.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
