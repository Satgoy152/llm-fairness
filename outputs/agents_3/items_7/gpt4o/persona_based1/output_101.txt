Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31   2  83  26  63  61  89
1  64  53  40  77  70  62  14
2  89   2  86  10  62   5   9
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[31  2 83 26 63 61 89]
 [64 53 40 77 70 62 14]
 [89  2 86 10 62  5  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible, or at least ensure that the allocations are fair in terms of maximizing total perceived value for each agent.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 31 + 2 + 83 + 26 + 63 + 61 + 89 = 355
   - Agent 1: 64 + 53 + 40 + 77 + 70 + 62 + 14 = 380
   - Agent 2: 89 + 2 + 86 + 10 + 62 + 5 + 9 = 263

2. **Determine Highest Valuation per Item:**
   - Item 0: Max value is 89 (Agent 2)
   - Item 1: Max value is 53 (Agent 1)
   - Item 2: Max value is 86 (Agent 2)
   - Item 3: Max value is 77 (Agent 1)
   - Item 4: Max value is 70 (Agent 1)
   - Item 5: Max value is 62 (Agent 1)
   - Item 6: Max value is 89 (Agent 0)

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign items to agents based on who values them the most:
     - Agent 0: Item 6
     - Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 4, 5
     - Agent 2: Items 0, 2

4. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   - Agent 0 has only 1 item, Agent 1 has 4 items, and Agent 2 has 2 items.
   - Reallocate to ensure each agent gets at least 2 items.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 6
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 5
   - Agent 2: Items 2, 4

This allocation gives each agent at least 2 items and attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation based on the initial highest valuation approach.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
