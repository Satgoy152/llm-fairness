Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27   5  79  51  74   4  78
1  83  85  24  55  83   6  74
2  64  15  34  97  75  74  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use a method like the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or similar fair division algorithms. However, for simplicity and given the data, we will attempt to manually balance the allocation based on the agents' valuations to minimize envy.

Let's first summarize the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 27 + 5 + 79 + 51 + 74 + 4 + 78 = 318
- Agent 1: 83 + 85 + 24 + 55 + 83 + 6 + 74 = 410
- Agent 2: 64 + 15 + 34 + 97 + 75 + 74 + 31 = 390

The goal is to allocate the items such that the perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's proceed with the allocation by starting with the highest valued items for each agent, attempting to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for items 2 (79), 6 (78), 4 (74)
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for items 1 (85), 0 (83), 4 (83)
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for items 3 (97), 5 (74), 4 (75)

We will try to allocate based on these preferences, ensuring all items are distributed and each agent gets a reasonable share of their high-value items:

- Allocate item 3 (value 97 for Agent 2) to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 1 (value 85 for Agent 1) to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 2 (value 79 for Agent 0) to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 0 (value 83 for Agent 1) to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 6 (value 78 for Agent 0) to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 (value 75 for Agent 2) to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 5 (value 74 for Agent 2) to Agent 2.

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 6
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4, and 5

This allocation aims to balance the perceived total value among the agents. Let's present it in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valued items, minimizing potential envy.
