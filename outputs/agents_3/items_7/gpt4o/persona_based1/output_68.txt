Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  43  51  39  88  69  23
1  28  76  51  85  79  18  74
2  95   8  97  70   1  41  27
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute them in a way that minimizes potential envy.

The table of valuations is as follows:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 47 | 43 | 51 | 39 | 88 | 69 | 23 |
| 1          | 28 | 76 | 51 | 85 | 79 | 18 | 74 |
| 2          | 95 | 8  | 97 | 70 | 1  | 41 | 27 |

One approach to achieve a fair division is to maximize the total value each agent receives, considering their specific valuations. This can be done by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

### Steps for Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest value is for agent 2 (95). Assign to agent 2.
   
2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest value is for agent 1 (76). Assign to agent 1.
   
3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest value is for agent 2 (97). Assign to agent 2.
   
4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest value is for agent 1 (85). Assign to agent 1.
   
5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest value is for agent 0 (88). Assign to agent 0.
   
6. **Item 5**:
   - Highest value is for agent 0 (69). Assign to agent 0.
   
7. **Item 6**:
   - Highest value is for agent 1 (74). Assign to agent 1.

### Resulting Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 2]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that they have relatively high valuations for, which helps in maintaining envy-freeness.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
