Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60   1  29  24  20  46  43
1   9  91  11  59  41  28  96
2  14  39  49  76  10  81  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we aim for envy-freeness, meaning that each agent should feel they received an allocation as valuable as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations. Given the constraints and the valuations, we can attempt to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 0, so it makes sense to allocate item 0 to Agent 0. Additionally, Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 5 and 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 1 and item 6, so we should allocate those to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 3 and item 5, so these should be allocated to Agent 2.

Now, let's perform the allocation with these considerations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (as Agent 2 values it highly, and Agent 0 already has item 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 values it more compared to other items).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it reasonably compared to others).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (as Agent 1 values it the highest).

This allocation should ensure that each agent's total valuation feels balanced according to their preferences. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2 with a total valuation of 89.
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, and 6 with a total valuation of 228.
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 5 with a total valuation of 157.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
