Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  52  97  18  76  83  42
1  34  38  20  89  50  10  16
2  95  48  10  60  64  60  45
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, given the constraints. The idea is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as any other agent, considering their own preferences.

Here's a possible allocation using the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has a strong preference for items 0, 2, and 5, with high values.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most, followed by item 4.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 highly, but since Agent 0 values it slightly more, Agent 2 will instead prioritize other items like 3, 4, and 6.

Let's distribute the items:

- **Agent 0**: We allocate items 0, 5, and 2 to Agent 0 because they have high valuations for these items.
- **Agent 1**: We'll assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 1, as these items have the highest valuations for them.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 1 and 6 to Agent 2, as these are reasonably valued, and Agent 2 is left with these after considering Agent 0 and Agent 1's stronger preferences for their allocated items.

This allocation tries to balance the valuations such that each agent receives items they value relatively higher, reducing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 6]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.
