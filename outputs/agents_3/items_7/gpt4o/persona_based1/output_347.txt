Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  13  18   5  73  66  56
1  82  84  86   9  34  57  36
2   4   1  58  31  60  39  92
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is a challenging task, especially with integer allocations, but we will try to make the distribution as fair as possible given the constraints. 

Let's proceed by examining the valuations of each agent for the items:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 18
  - Item 3: 5
  - Item 4: 73
  - Item 5: 66
  - Item 6: 56

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 82
  - Item 1: 84
  - Item 2: 86
  - Item 3: 9
  - Item 4: 34
  - Item 5: 57
  - Item 6: 36

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 4
  - Item 1: 1
  - Item 2: 58
  - Item 3: 31
  - Item 4: 60
  - Item 5: 39
  - Item 6: 92

A possible allocation strategy could be to assign each agent the items for which they have the highest relative valuation compared to the others. We also ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

After analyzing the valuations, a feasible allocation is:

- Agent 0 could receive items they value highly compared to the others, like item 4 and item 5.
- Agent 1 could receive items they value most, such as item 0 and item 1.
- Agent 2 could receive items they value most, such as item 2, item 3, and item 6.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation tries to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items.
