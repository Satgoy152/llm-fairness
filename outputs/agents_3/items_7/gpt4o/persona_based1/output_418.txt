Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  43  95  47  26  38  51
1  28  52  98   5  63  72  35
2  38  25   1  71  42  20  10
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, one approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that no agent envies another agent’s allocation. This can be challenging due to the differing valuations for each item. However, we can aim for a balanced allocation that maximizes the minimum satisfaction.

First, let’s calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 47 + 43 + 95 + 47 + 26 + 38 + 51 = 347
- Agent 1: 28 + 52 + 98 + 5 + 63 + 72 + 35 = 353
- Agent 2: 38 + 25 + 1 + 71 + 42 + 20 + 10 = 207

Now, we need to distribute the items such that the total valuations received by each agent are as balanced as possible.

A potential allocation strategy could be as follows:

1. Allocate items based on the highest individual valuations while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of their total valuation.
2. Adjust the allocations to minimize envy by swapping items if necessary.

Let's proceed with an allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 2 (95), which is also highly valued by Agent 1. Agent 1's second-highest valuation is for item 5 (72).
- Agent 1 highly values item 2 (98) and item 5 (72). The next highest is item 4 (63) which is not highly valued by others.
- Agent 2 highly values item 3 (71), which can be allocated without overlap.

Based on these observations, a possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 5]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value, balancing the total valuation each agent receives.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
