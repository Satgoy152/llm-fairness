Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  16  67  39  68  43   2
1   6  98  75  63  44   2  72
2  47  31  38  98  66  66  43
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 16 67 39 68 43  2]
 [ 6 98 75 63 44  2 72]
 [47 31 38 98 66 66 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we will aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy, meaning each agent should prefer their own allocation over anyone else's or at least not prefer another agent's allocation more than their own. 

Given the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  16  67  39  68  43   2
1   6  98  75  63  44   2  72
2  47  31  38  98  66  66  43
```

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and then allocate them in a way that minimizes envy.

1. **Agent 0**: Total value = 91 + 16 + 67 + 39 + 68 + 43 + 2 = 326
2. **Agent 1**: Total value = 6 + 98 + 75 + 63 + 44 + 2 + 72 = 360
3. **Agent 2**: Total value = 47 + 31 + 38 + 98 + 66 + 66 + 43 = 389

We will consider the highest valued items for each agent and allocate them accordingly, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, as well as aiming to balance the total value across agents.

### Allocating Items:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0 (Value 91)
  - Item 2 (Value 67)
  
- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 1 (Value 98)
  - Item 3 (Value 63)
  
- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 4 (Value 66)
  - Item 5 (Value 66)
  - Item 6 (Value 43)

### Explanation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, which are relatively high in their valuation.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3, which are the highest and third-highest in their valuation.
- Agent 2 receives items 4, 5, and 6, which are their two mid-high and one lowest valued item, yet they align well with the remaining items after considering Agent 0 and Agent 1's allocations.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items that align with their preferences as much as possible while distributing the total number of items fairly. 

### Final Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```
