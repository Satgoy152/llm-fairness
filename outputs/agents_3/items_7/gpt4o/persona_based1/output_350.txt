Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  37  55  68  48  31  86
1  78  20  84  14  99  23  43
2  68  42  27  99  41  51  54
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item while ensuring that no agent feels envious of another's allocation. Since there are 7 items and 3 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but we aim to balance their satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 86.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 99.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 99.

With these high-value items in mind, we can start by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent. This method often helps in creating a sense of fairness:

1. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 3 out of 7 items. Next, we consider the remaining valuations and continue the allocation:

- The remaining items are 0, 1, 2, 5.
- Agent 0 values item 3 second highest at 68 (already allocated), so the next highest is item 2 at 55.
- Agent 1 values item 2 second highest at 84.
- Agent 2 values item 0 second highest at 68.

Continuing with the allocation:

4. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (to balance item count and because they have a high valuation for it).
5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (since item 0 is their second-highest valuation).
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest available for Agent 0).
7. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (completing the allocation).

Now, each agent has been fairly considered based on their highest valuations, and all items are allocated. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [3, 0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, aiming to minimize envy among them.
