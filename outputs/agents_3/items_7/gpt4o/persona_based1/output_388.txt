Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  23  76  65  24  88  12
1  12  50  82  76   6  32   2
2  64  41  62  51  97  50  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[50 23 76 65 24 88 12]
 [12 50 82 76  6 32  2]
 [64 41 62 51 97 50 85]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, if possible, or at least an allocation that minimizes envy. Let's analyze the valuations and try to distribute the items to achieve fairness.

### Valuations Table:
```
          0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agent 0: 50  23  76  65  24  88  12
Agent 1: 12  50  82  76   6  32   2
Agent 2: 64  41  62  51  97  50  85
```

### Approach:
1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 5 very high (88).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 very high (82).
   - Agent 2 values item 4 very high (97).

2. **Assign High-Value Items**:
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - Based on remaining high values and to balance the total value each agent gets, assign the remaining items.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 5
  - Total value for Agent 0: 50 (item 0) + 88 (item 5) = 138
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 3
  - Total value for Agent 1: 82 (item 2) + 76 (item 3) = 158
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 4, 6
  - Total value for Agent 2: 41 (item 1) + 97 (item 4) + 85 (item 6) = 223

This allocation considers the high-value items and attempts to balance the overall value each agent receives.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their preferences, aiming to minimize envy among them.
