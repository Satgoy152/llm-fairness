Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  81  57  40  17  29  28
1  85   0  97  22  24  26  77
2  97  70  54  49  19  16  23
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use an approach that balances the distribution based on the agents' valuations, aiming for an envy-free or approximately envy-free solution. Let's go through the valuations and try to allocate the items considering the preferences of each agent.

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Highest valued items: 1 (81), 2 (57), 3 (40)
   - Initial allocation: Let's consider giving item 1 and 2 to Agent 0 due to higher valuations.

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (85), 2 (97), 6 (77)
   - Since item 2 is already considered for Agent 0, let's allocate item 0 and 6 to Agent 1 for high valuation.

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (97), 1 (70), 3 (49)
   - Since item 0 is already allocated to Agent 1, and item 1 is allocated to Agent 0, let's allocate item 3 and potentially another lower valued item to Agent 2.

4. **Review Remaining Items:**
   - Items 4, 5 are still unallocated. 
   - Consider Agent 2, as they received items with relatively lower individual valuations compared to their preferences. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 to balance item count.

### Final Allocation:
This distribution considers each agent's highest valuations while trying to balance the number of items each receives.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated, each agent has a reasonable share, and the allocations attempt to minimize envy based on the valuations provided.
