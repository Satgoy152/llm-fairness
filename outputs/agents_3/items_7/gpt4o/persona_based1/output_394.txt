Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16   8  63  47  31  50  64
1   4  30  40  63  58  31  45
2  90  87   5  17  99  78  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[16  8 63 47 31 50 64]
 [ 4 30 40 63 58 31 45]
 [90 87  5 17 99 78 48]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle.

To achieve this, we can use the following approach:
1. We calculate each agent's total valuation for each possible allocation.
2. We try to find an allocation where each agent values their bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle.

Given the valuations, let's attempt a fair allocation:

### Valuation Table
```
Agent 0: [16, 8, 63, 47, 31, 50, 64]
Agent 1: [4, 30, 40, 63, 58, 31, 45]
Agent 2: [90, 87, 5, 17, 99, 78, 48]
```

### Allocation Strategy
- Assign items in such a way that the total value for each agent's bundle is balanced as much as possible.
- Consider the highest valuations for each agent and try to give each agent the items they value the most.

### Allocation
- **Agent 0**: Items [2, 6]
  - Total valuation = 63 + 64 = 127
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 4]
  - Total valuation = 63 + 58 = 121
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 1, 5]
  - Total valuation = 90 + 87 + 78 = 255

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they highly value while trying to balance the distribution of total valuations as much as possible.

### Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation is envy-free to the extent possible given the valuations, as each agent receives items they value significantly.
