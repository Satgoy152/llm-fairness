Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  13  57  48  18  93  14
1  41  83  67  90  32  39  95
2  45  94  65  52  71  26   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness is a challenging criterion to achieve fully, especially with an odd number of items, but we can strive to minimize the differences in perceived value between what each agent receives and what they could have received.

Let's assess the valuations first:

- Agent 0: [28, 13, 57, 48, 18, 93, 14]
- Agent 1: [41, 83, 67, 90, 32, 39, 95]
- Agent 2: [45, 94, 65, 52, 71, 26, 0]

We want to distribute 7 items among 3 agents, considering their preferences.

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 5 (93), which is also valued by Agent 1 but not as much as Agent 1 values item 6.
2. **Agent 1** seems to have a preference for item 6 (95) and item 3 (90).
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 (94) highly, which is the highest value across all agents for any item.

Based on these observations, a potential allocation can be:

- **Agent 0**: Items [5] (value: 93)
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 6] (values: 90, 95)
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 2, 4, 0] (values: 94, 65, 71, 45)

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one of their highly valued items. Now let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 4, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation considers the highest preferences to minimize envy.
