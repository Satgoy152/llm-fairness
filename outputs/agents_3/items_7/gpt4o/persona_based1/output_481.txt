Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  47  63  25  89  46  45
1  16  30  92  30  60  87  72
2  64  81  62  42  39  91  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 81 62 42 39 91 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that envy-freeness is achieved as much as possible, we can consider each agent's valuation of the items. One common approach is to use the "maximum envy-free" allocation, which aims to allocate items so that no agent feels another agent's allocation is strictly better than their own.

Here's the table of valuations for convenience:

```
       0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agent 0: 63  47  63  25  89  46  45
Agent 1: 16  30  92  30  60  87  72
Agent 2: 64  81  62  42  39  91  94
```

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Identify High-Value Items:** First, identify the items that are highly valued by each agent.
2. **Greedy Allocation:** Assign items to agents based on maximizing their individual valuation while considering fairness.
3. **Check Envy:** Adjust allocations if there is significant envy.

### Allocation Process
- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest values are for items: 4 (89), 2 (63), and 0 (63).
  - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest values are for items: 2 (92), 5 (87), and 6 (72).
  - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

- **Agent 2:**
  - Highest values are for items: 6 (94), 5 (91), and 1 (81).
  - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

### Continue Allocation
- **Agent 0:** 
  - Remaining high-value item is 0 (63).
  - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

- **Agent 1:**
  - Next high-value item is item 5 (87).
  - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

- **Agent 2:**
  - Next high-value item is item 1 (81).
  - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

### Final Adjustments
- Two remaining items: 3 and 7.
- Allocate based on remaining highest values for each agent.
  - **Agent 1:** Allocate item 3 (30).
  - **Agent 2:** Allocate item 7 (39).

### Final Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 3],
    "2": [6, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, aiming to minimize envy between agents.
