Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  52  86  33  81  60  35
1  20  71  56  82  25  45  99
2  17  19  42  55  10  60  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, while also ensuring that the allocation is envy-free, if possible. This means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. 

First, let's analyze the valuations of each agent for the items:

- Agent 0 values items most highly: 2, 4, and 1.
- Agent 1 values items most highly: 6, 3, and 1.
- Agent 2 values items most highly: 6, 5, and 3.

With these preferences in mind, we can make an initial assignment of items by trying to give each agent some of their top choices without causing envy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 2 (86) is the highest value for Agent 0.
   - Item 4 (81) is the second highest value for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 6 (99) is the highest value for Agent 1.
   - Item 3 (82) is the second highest value for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 5 (60) is valued equally by Agent 2 and Agent 0, but Agent 2 values it relatively high compared to other items.
   - Item 0 (17) and Item 1 (19) have lower values for Agent 2, but since the higher valued items (6 and 3) are already assigned, we assign these to minimize envy.

This distribution aims to balance the values received by each agent:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 6 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 5, 0, and 1.

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [5, 0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.
