Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4  75   8  43  84  11  79
1  12   7  25  79  44  36  69
2  82  61  43  75  75  31   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to find an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness with indivisible goods, we'll strive for a reasonable division that considers each agent's preferences.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step, considering each agent's highest-valued items:

1. **Agent 0's preferences**: Highest to lowest are item 4 (84), item 6 (79), item 1 (75).
2. **Agent 1's preferences**: Highest to lowest are item 3 (79), item 6 (69), item 4 (44).
3. **Agent 2's preferences**: Highest to lowest are item 0 (82), item 3 (75), item 4 (75).

Considering these preferences, let's proceed with an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate the highest value item for Agent 0, which is item 4 (84).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate the highest available value item for Agent 1, which is item 3 (79).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate the highest available value item for Agent 2, which is item 0 (82).

Continuing with the next highest available preferences for each:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 6 (79), the next highest preference for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1 (7), as items 6 and 3 are already taken, next highest available for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2 (43), as items 0 and 3 are taken, next highest available for Agent 2.

With items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 allocated, we have item 5 left to allocate:

- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 5 (36) as it's the next available item for Agent 1.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences as much as possible given indivisibility:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
