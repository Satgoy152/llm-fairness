Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  11  29   3  33  86  49
1   6  10  62  98  51  90  82
2  20  39  57  33  41  18  59
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the round-robin or the adjusted winner procedure. However, since the number of items (7) doesn't match the number of agents (3) perfectly, some compromises might need to be made. Let's aim to distribute the items so that each agent values their own allocation as highly as possible while minimizing envy.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 5 (86) and 0 (49).
- Agent 1 values item 3 (98) very highly, followed by items 5 (90) and 6 (82).
- Agent 2 has a relatively even distribution but values item 6 (59) and item 2 (57) the most.

To ensure a fair division, we can aim for envy-freeness by initially allocating the highest valued items to each agent and then adjust based on remaining options.

### Initial High-Value Allocations:
1. **Agent 0:**
   - Choose item 5 (value 86) as it is the highest valued item for Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Choose item 3 (value 98) as it is the highest valued item for Agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Choose item 6 (value 59) as it is the highest valued item for Agent 2.

### Remaining Items:
- Items left: 0, 1, 2, 4

### Subsequent Allocations:
- Agent 0 also values item 0 (49), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 5 highly, but it's already taken, so the next best option is item 2 (62).
- Agent 2 values item 4 (41) next after item 6, so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

### Remaining Item:
- Item 1 is left, which has relatively low valuations from all agents. As a neutral pick, give it to Agent 1 to balance the number of items each agent has.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 5, 0
- Agent 1: Items 3, 2, 1
- Agent 2: Items 6, 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one of their highly-valued items, and the remaining items are distributed in a way that minimizes overall envy.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [3, 2, 1],
    "2": [6, 4]
}
```
