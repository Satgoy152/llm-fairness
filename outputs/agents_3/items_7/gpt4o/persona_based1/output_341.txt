Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4  33  35  13  38  64  33
1  55  66  81  90  64  11  64
2  96  12  92  36  25  75  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96 12 92 36 25 75 37]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to allocate the items such that no agent envies another's allocation. One common approach to achieve this is to use the concept of "envy-freeness," which ensures that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [4, 33, 35, 13, 38, 64, 33]
Agent 1: [55, 66, 81, 90, 64, 11, 64]
Agent 2: [96, 12, 92, 36, 25, 75, 37]
```

We'll strive to allocate items while considering these valuations, aiming for each agent to get a collection of items they consider valuable.

One potential allocation strategy that respects these valuations is as follows:

1. Assign each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring no item is allocated more than once.
2. Ensure each agent is satisfied with their allocation by comparing the total value they receive with the value they perceive in other agents' allocations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highly values items 5 and 2.
- Agent 1 highly values item 3.
- Agent 2 highly values item 0 and 5 (but 5 is already taken), so item 2 is also valuable.

With this consideration:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 3, 4
- Agent 2 receives items: 0, 2, 6

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly and minimizes potential envy.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2, 6]
}
```
