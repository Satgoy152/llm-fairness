Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  23  49  73   6  37  23
1  97  84  53  23  38  26  28
2  43  46  30  93  61  35  88
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 84 53 23 38 26 28]
 [43 46 30 93 61 35 88]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents with consideration for fair division and envy-freeness, let's start by analyzing the total valuations each agent has for all items and then proceed with an allocation strategy that aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

### Total Valuations for Each Agent:

- **Agent 0:** 31 + 23 + 49 + 73 + 6 + 37 + 23 = 242
- **Agent 1:** 97 + 84 + 53 + 23 + 38 + 26 + 28 = 349
- **Agent 2:** 43 + 46 + 30 + 93 + 61 + 35 + 88 = 396

### Greedy Strategy for Fair Allocation:

1. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item for Agent 1 is item 0 (97).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Next highest is item 1 (84).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value item for Agent 2 is item 3 (93).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Next highest is item 6 (88).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

3. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 will now choose from the remaining items: [2, 4, 5].
   - Highest value item for Agent 0 is item 3 (73), but it's already taken, so next is item 2 (49).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Remaining items [4, 5]:** 
   - For Agent 0, item 5 (37) is more valuable than item 4 (6).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   - The last item, item 4, goes to Agent 2 since it's the least valuable for Agent 0 and has decent value for Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation is devised to ensure that each agent receives items that are relatively valuable to them, while also attempting to minimize envy by considering the distribution of high-value items.
