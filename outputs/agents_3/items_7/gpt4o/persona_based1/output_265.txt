Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  88  95  70  89  75  60
1  74  20  90  93  44   6  30
2  66   5  73  89  81  26  16
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a way that is fair and envy-free, we should consider each agent's valuation for each item. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation. For this scenario, we'll use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent and ensures each agent has an integer number of items.

Here is one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Items 2 (95), 4 (89), 1 (88)
   - Allocate: Items 2, 4, 1
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Items 3 (93), 0 (74)
   - Allocate: Items 3, 0

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Items 5 (26), 6 (16)
   - Allocate: Items 5, 6

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's total valuation of their assigned items while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 1],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that considers their preferences and that all items are distributed.
