Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  12  56  74  11  26  77
1  18  41  24  78  38  27  43
2  56  12  54  50  65  85  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a method like the adjusted winner procedure or any other fair division algorithm. However, given the simplicity of the problem and the integer constraints, we can try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent has for all items combined:

- Agent 0: \(33 + 12 + 56 + 74 + 11 + 26 + 77 = 289\)
- Agent 1: \(18 + 41 + 24 + 78 + 38 + 27 + 43 = 269\)
- Agent 2: \(56 + 12 + 54 + 50 + 65 + 85 + 32 = 354\)

The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that each agent's total value from their allocated items is as balanced as possible.

A strategy to achieve this is to start by allocating the highest valued items for each agent, and then adjust to ensure all items are allocated:

1. **Agent 0**'s highest values are for items 6, 3, and 2.
2. **Agent 1**'s highest values are for items 3, 4, and 1.
3. **Agent 2**'s highest values are for items 5, 4, and 0.

We need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. One possible allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 6]
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 1]
- **Agent 2**: Items [4, 5, 2]

Now, let's verify the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives: \(33 + 77 = 110\)
- Agent 1 receives: \(78 + 41 = 119\)
- Agent 2 receives: \(65 + 85 + 54 = 204\)

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [4, 5, 2]
}
```
