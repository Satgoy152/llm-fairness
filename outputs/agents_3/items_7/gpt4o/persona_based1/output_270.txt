Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  53  49  53   5  75  25
1  43  35  96  36  95  96  76
2  18  30  86  64   0  87  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims for envy-freeness and efficiency, we should consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute the items fairly:

- Agent 0 has relatively high valuations on items 0, 1, 3, and 5.
- Agent 1 has very high valuations on items 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- Agent 2 has high valuations on items 2, 3, and 5.

A strategy is to try to allocate items where each agent has high valuation, while keeping in mind the total value each agent receives.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Let's assign item 5 to agent 0, as agent 0 highly values it and it prevents agent 1 or 2 from gaining an overwhelming advantage from it.
- Assign item 2 to agent 1 as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 as they value it highly.
- Assign item 6 to agent 1, as they also value it highly.
- Assign item 3 to agent 2, as they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 1 to agent 0, as they value it second highest after item 5.
- Assign item 0 to agent 0, giving them another item they value reasonably.

With this allocation, each agent receives items they value highly, attempting to balance the overall satisfaction and minimize envy among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [3]
}
```
