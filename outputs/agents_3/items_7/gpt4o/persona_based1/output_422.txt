Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  75   6  90   0  14  28
1  26  91  61  86  91  94  85
2  18   2  98  68  82  72  12
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate items in a way that could minimize envy among agents, adhering to the principle of envy-freeness as much as possible given the discrete nature of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, considering their own valuations.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [40, 75, 6, 90, 0, 14, 28]
- Agent 1 values: [26, 91, 61, 86, 91, 94, 85]
- Agent 2 values: [18, 2, 98, 68, 82, 72, 12]

The sum of valuations for each agent is as follows:
- Agent 0 total: 253
- Agent 1 total: 534
- Agent 2 total: 352

Now, we'll aim to allocate items to each agent while considering their preferences to ensure a fair distribution.

A potential allocation strategy is to give each item to the agent who values it the most, as long as this results in a balanced distribution of items. If a direct allocation leads to imbalance (e.g., one agent receiving too many items), adjustments can be made to achieve a fairer distribution.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 40.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 98.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 90.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 94.
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 85.

Now, let's adjust this allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item:

- Give Item 5 to Agent 2 instead of Agent 1.
- Give Item 6 to Agent 0 instead of Agent 1.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5

This distribution aims to be fair given the constraints and preferences, with each agent receiving a share of items they value.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
