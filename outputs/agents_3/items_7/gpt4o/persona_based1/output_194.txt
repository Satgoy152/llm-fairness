Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  60  30  66  92  15  48
1  17  51  29  82  65   5   5
2  99   0   3  77   4  95  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their individual valuations, we should aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent believes their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation according to their own valuations.

Given the valuations, let's analyze the best possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High valuation for items: 4 (92), 3 (66), 1 (60)
   - Medium valuation for items: 0 (45), 6 (48)
   - Low valuation for items: 2 (30), 5 (15)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuation for items: 3 (82), 4 (65), 1 (51)
   - Medium valuation for items: 2 (29), 0 (17)
   - Low valuation for items: 5 (5), 6 (5)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuation for items: 0 (99), 5 (95), 6 (93)
   - Medium valuation for items: 3 (77)
   - Low valuation for items: 2 (3), 4 (4), 1 (0)

To find a fair allocation, a potential strategy is to assign items based on the highest value-to-each-agent for each item in a way that tries to balance the total perceived value.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Items 1 and 3, giving them a total valuation of 60 + 66 = 126
- **Agent 1**: 
  - Items 2 and 4, giving them a total valuation of 29 + 65 = 94
- **Agent 2**: 
  - Items 0, 5, and 6, giving them a total valuation of 99 + 95 + 93 = 287

This allocation is structured to balance the total perceived value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives the items they value highly relative to others.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5, 6]
}
```
