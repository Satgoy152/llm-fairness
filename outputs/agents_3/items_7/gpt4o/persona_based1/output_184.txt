Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  65  18  65  39  97  79
1  49  33   6  30  16  19  98
2  45  22  94  13  61  81  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair. One approach is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion, which strives to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [62, 65, 18, 65, 39, 97, 79]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [49, 33, 6, 30, 16, 19, 98]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [45, 22, 94, 13, 61, 81, 90]

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can use a strategy that assigns items to agents based on their highest valuations while trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 5 (value 97)
   - Item 3 (value 65)
  
   Total value for Agent 0: 97 + 65 = 162

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 6 (value 98)
   - Item 0 (value 49)

   Total value for Agent 1: 98 + 49 = 147

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 2 (value 94)
   - Item 4 (value 61)
   - Item 1 (value 22)

   Total value for Agent 2: 94 + 61 + 22 = 177

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences, and the distribution attempts to keep the values relatively balanced to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [2, 4, 1]
}
```
