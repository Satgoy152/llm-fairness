Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  29  13  32   1  55  40
1  40  55  95  42  41  95  84
2  20  65  42  79  26  72  71
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find a fair allocation of items to agents, we aim to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy, taking into account the valuations provided. We will employ a simple method to try to achieve envy-freeness, recognizing that perfect envy-freeness is not always possible with indivisible goods.

Given the valuations:

```
        Items
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agents
0      30  29  13  32   1  55  40
1      40  55  95  42  41  95  84
2      20  65  42  79  26  72  71
```

We will allocate items to agents in a way that attempts to maximize their satisfaction.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Allocate the items that each agent values the most, provided it does not cause significant envy.

2. **Iterative Assignment**: Assign items iteratively and check if the allocation results in minimal possible envy.

3. **Adjustment**: Adjust allocations if necessary to try to reduce envy.

### Allocation

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items 5 (value 55) and 0 (value 30).

2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items 2 (value 95) and 6 (value 84).

3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items 3 (value 79) and 1 (value 65).

After considering these preferences and ensuring all items are allocated, the allocations can be as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items [5, 0]
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 6, 4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [3, 1]

This allocation attempts to satisfy each agent's preferences to the best extent possible with a minimal number of items being redistributed to reduce envy.

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 6, 4],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with items of their higher preferences, ensuring all items are distributed and attempting to keep envy minimal.
