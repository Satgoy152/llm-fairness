Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  27  63  26  39  58  34
1  61  64  60  87  27  70  75
2  30   9  24  85  95  88  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 27 63 26 39 58 34]
 [61 64 60 87 27 70 75]
 [30  9 24 85 95 88 34]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the three agents, we will aim for an envy-free distribution as much as possible. Envy-freeness implies that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent given their own preferences.

Given the valuations:

Agent 0: [95, 27, 63, 26, 39, 58, 34]  
Agent 1: [61, 64, 60, 87, 27, 70, 75]  
Agent 2: [30, 9, 24, 85, 95, 88, 34]  

We will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their own utility while considering the overall envy-free condition.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent Preferences**: Consider each agent's top-valued items and allocate these in a way that maximizes their own satisfaction first.
2. **Balance**: Ensure each agent gets at least two items (since there are three agents and seven items, we can have one agent with three items).
3. **Envy-free**: Prioritize allocations that minimize envy between agents based on their valuations.

### Proposed Allocation

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 3 and item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 4 and item 5, but will prioritize item 4 and item 6.

With these considerations, here is a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2]  
  - Item 0 (95) and Item 2 (63) are highly valued.
  
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 3, 5]  
  - Item 3 (87) and Item 5 (70) are highly valued.
  
- **Agent 2**: Items [4, 6]  
  - Item 4 (95) and Item 6 (34) are highly valued.

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest values for each agent and attempts to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy and maximizes individual satisfaction.
