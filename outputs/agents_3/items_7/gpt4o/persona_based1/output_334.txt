Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  26  49  94  24  92  21
1  75  97  20  81  50  95  59
2  34  16  57  64  47  11  24
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they would value another agent's allocation. Given the valuations, we can use an algorithmic approach to assign items to maximize fairness and minimize envy.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Choose items that are highly valued by Agent 0. Item 3 is the highest valued by Agent 0, followed by items 0 and 5.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 5, so we can assign these items to Agent 1, followed by item 4.

3. **Agent 2**: For Agent 2, items 2 and 4 are relatively high in value, and then item 6.

By this approach, each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, aiming to maintain fairness.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to balance the perceived value for each agent based on their valuations.
