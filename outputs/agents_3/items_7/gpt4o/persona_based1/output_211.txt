Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  92  67  64  36   5  77
1   0  15  52  55  76   2  83
2  83  89  87  32  71  44  72
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy among agents, we can consider maximizing the value each agent receives from their allocated items. One common approach is to ensure each agent receives items that collectively have a high value according to their individual valuation. Let's try to allocate the items by considering the highest-valued items for each agent.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (92), followed by item 6 (77), and item 0 (58).
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most (83), followed by item 4 (76), and item 3 (55).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (83), followed by item 2 (87), and item 1 (89).

An allocation strategy could be to prioritize assigning each agent items they value highly, while ensuring all items are distributed.

### Proposed Allocation:
1. **Agent 0:**
   - Allocate items 1 and 6 based on their high valuation (92 and 77) and items 3 and 0 (4 items total).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Allocate items 4 and 2 based on their valuation (76 and 52).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Allocate item 5 based on their remaining value (44) since it was not strongly contested and item 3 is already allocated to agent 0.

### Check:
- Each agent receives items they value highly.
- Total items allocated: 7 (Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 3, 0],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items in a way that respects each agent's preferences as much as possible, thus aiming to minimize envy.
