Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  57  87   3   9  46   2
1  83  63  28  97  13  64  61
2  56  52  89  67  49  93  18
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we can apply a method that aims to distribute the items in a way that each agent receives a bundle of items they value highly relative to the others. 

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (value 87).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (value 97).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (value 93).

2. **Assign the highest valued items:**  
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

3. **Consider remaining items and their values:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 4, 6.
   - Check the next highest values for each agent:
     - Agent 0: item 1 (value 57), item 0 (value 29), item 5 (value 46), item 4 (value 9), item 6 (value 2).
     - Agent 1: item 0 (value 83), item 1 (value 63), item 5 (value 64), item 6 (value 61), item 4 (value 13).
     - Agent 2: item 2 (value 89), item 1 (value 52), item 0 (value 56), item 3 (value 67), item 4 (value 49), item 6 (value 18).

4. **Allocate remaining items based on maximizing individual agent's satisfaction with overall allocation:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it second highest and it's not yet allocated).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it after item 2 and it's not yet allocated).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values it reasonably high and it's not yet allocated).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it more than the others, and it balances the allocation).

5. **Final allocation:**
   - Agent 0: items [1, 2]
   - Agent 1: items [0, 3, 6]
   - Agent 2: items [4, 5]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items that closely matches their preferences, optimizing for fairness and reducing potential envy.
