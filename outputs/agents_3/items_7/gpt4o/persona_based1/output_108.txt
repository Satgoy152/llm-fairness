Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  76  89  27  60  16  31
1  90  46  49  98  83  80  53
2   6  28  16  89  51   1  71
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness implies that each agent perceives their own allocation to be at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation according to their own valuation.

Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most, followed by items 1, 0, and so on. Their top three items are 2, 1, and 0.

2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most, followed by items 0, 4, and so on. Their top three items are 3, 0, and 4.

3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most, followed by items 6, 4, and so on. Their top three items are 3, 6, and 4.

We should aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while ensuring a fair distribution.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

- **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1:** This item is highly valued by both Agent 1 and Agent 2, but Agent 1 values it the most (98). Thus, item 3 goes to Agent 1.

- **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0:** This is the highest-valued item for Agent 0 (89), so it goes to Agent 0.

- **Allocate item 6 to Agent 2:** The highest-valued remaining item for Agent 2 is item 6 (71).

- **Allocate item 0 to Agent 1:** After item 3, item 0 is the next highest-valued item for Agent 1 (90).

- **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0:** The next highest-valued item for Agent 0 is item 1 (76).

- **Allocate item 4 to Agent 2:** The next highest-valued item for Agent 2 is item 4 (51).

- **Allocate item 5 to Agent 1:** Lastly, Agent 1 receives item 5, which they value at 80.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 0, 5],
    "2": [6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives their most valued items as much as possible given the constraints, and all items are distributed.
