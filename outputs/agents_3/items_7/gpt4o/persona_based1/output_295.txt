Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  10  10  72  22  24  71
1  21  71  18   5  77  60  35
2  40  93  88  65  66  80  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[36 10 10 72 22 24 71]
 [21 71 18  5 77 60 35]
 [40 93 88 65 66 80 91]]
Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly, we need to consider the agents' valuations of the items and try to achieve an envy-free and fair division. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. However, achieving complete envy-freeness with discrete items and integer allocations can be challenging. We'll aim to provide a balanced allocation based on the given valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [36, 10, 10, 72, 22, 24, 71]
- Agent 1: [21, 71, 18, 5, 77, 60, 35]
- Agent 2: [40, 93, 88, 65, 66, 80, 91]

We'll allocate the items by considering the highest value each agent places on the remaining items during the allocation process.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Assign item 1** to Agent 2, as they value it the highest at 93.
2. **Assign item 4** to Agent 1, as they value it the highest at 77.
3. **Assign item 3** to Agent 0, as they value it the highest at 72.
4. **Assign item 6** to Agent 2, as they value it the highest at 91.
5. **Assign item 5** to Agent 1, as they value it the highest at 60.
6. **Assign item 0** to Agent 0, as they value it the highest at 36.
7. **Assign item 2** to Agent 2, as they value it second highest at 88.

This ensures each agent receives items they highly value, working towards a fair division.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the valuations and provide a division that minimizes envy to the extent possible with integer allocations.
