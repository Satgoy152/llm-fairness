Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  16  86  94  56   9  50
1  46  86  97  84  56  47  69
2  20   9  36  12  73  53  53
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the method of maximizing each agent's total valuation of their allocated items. Let's proceed with a step-by-step allocation:

1. **List the total valuations for each item by each agent:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 = 47, Agent 1 = 46, Agent 2 = 20
   - Item 1: Agent 0 = 16, Agent 1 = 86, Agent 2 = 9
   - Item 2: Agent 0 = 86, Agent 1 = 97, Agent 2 = 36
   - Item 3: Agent 0 = 94, Agent 1 = 84, Agent 2 = 12
   - Item 4: Agent 0 = 56, Agent 1 = 56, Agent 2 = 73
   - Item 5: Agent 0 = 9, Agent 1 = 47, Agent 2 = 53
   - Item 6: Agent 0 = 50, Agent 1 = 69, Agent 2 = 53

2. **Allocate items based on highest individual valuations:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 (47 > 46 > 20)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (86 > 16 > 9)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (97 > 86 > 36)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (94 > 84 > 12)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (73 > 56 = 56)
   - Item 5: Agent 2 (53 > 47 > 9)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (69 > 53 > 50)

3. **Verify the total number of items allocated:**

   - Agent 0: 2 items (0, 3)
   - Agent 1: 3 items (1, 2, 6)
   - Agent 2: 2 items (4, 5)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items valued as highly as possible according to their preferences, helping to minimize envy.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
