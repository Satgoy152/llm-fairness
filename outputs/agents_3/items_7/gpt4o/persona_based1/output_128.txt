Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  44  50  64  24  76  91
1  14  15  91  30  48  53  98
2  72  83  18  61  93  90  69
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. Given the valuations provided, let's attempt to distribute the items to minimize envy and ensure fairness.

First, let's summarize the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \(59 + 44 + 50 + 64 + 24 + 76 + 91 = 408\)
- Agent 1: \(14 + 15 + 91 + 30 + 48 + 53 + 98 = 349\)
- Agent 2: \(72 + 83 + 18 + 61 + 93 + 90 + 69 = 486\)

Now, we will aim to allocate items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is roughly balanced, considering their total valuation capabilities.

To allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are: Item 6 (91), Item 5 (76).
   - Assign items: 6, 5.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 1 are: Item 6 (98), Item 2 (91). Item 6 has already been taken.
   - Next highest for Agent 1 are: Item 2 (91), Item 5 (53).
   - Assign items: 2, 4.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 2 are: Item 4 (93), Item 5 (90). Item 5 has already been taken.
   - Next highest for Agent 2 are: Item 4 (93), Item 1 (83).
   - Assign items: 0, 1, 3.

Re-evaluating the allocations:

- Agent 0 has items: 6, 5 (value: 91 + 76 = 167)
- Agent 1 has items: 2, 4 (value: 91 + 48 = 139)
- Agent 2 has items: 0, 1, 3 (value: 72 + 83 + 61 = 216)

These allocations attempt to balance between everyone's preferred items and ensure that no agent is particularly envious of another's allocation. Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
