Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  99  92  90  43  27  55
1   9  93  40   9  82  52  91
2  28  71  45  98  75  44  33
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and aim for envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy among the agents. We'll consider the valuations provided and try to distribute the items efficiently.

Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest (99), so we can start by giving them item 1.
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 the highest (91), so we can assign them item 6.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest (98), so we can allocate item 3 to them.

Next, we will continue to assign remaining items to balance the allocation based on the remaining values:

4. **Agent 0** should get item 2 (valued at 92) since it's their second highest value.
5. **Agent 1** can be given item 4 (valued at 82) as it's their second highest value.
6. **Agent 2** can take item 5 (valued at 44) since it provides a decent value.

Lastly, we have item 0 left:

7. **Agent 0** can take item 0 (valued at 47) because it adds to their total value.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation is done to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuation of the items, and the total count of items allocated is exactly 7.
