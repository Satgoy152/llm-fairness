Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  16  80  97  84  12  45
1  89  44  45  14  72  34  30
2  33  58  65  14  37  97  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[72 16 80 97 84 12 45]
 [89 44 45 14 72 34 30]
 [33 58 65 14 37 97 26]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items that is envy-free as much as possible, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them such that no agent prefers someone else's allocation to their own. We also need to ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [72, 16, 80, 97, 84, 12, 45]
- Agent 1: [89, 44, 45, 14, 72, 34, 30]
- Agent 2: [33, 58, 65, 14, 37, 97, 26]

A reasonable approach is to allocate items in a manner that maximizes each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while attempting to maintain envy-freeness. We can use a heuristic approach to achieve this.

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [3, 4]
   - Total valuation: 97 (item 3) + 84 (item 4) = 181

2. **Agent 1**: Items [0, 6]
   - Total valuation: 89 (item 0) + 30 (item 6) = 119

3. **Agent 2**: Items [1, 2, 5]
   - Total valuation: 58 (item 1) + 65 (item 2) + 97 (item 5) = 220

The allocation ensures that:

- Each agent gets a different subset of items.
- The total allocation is exactly 7 items.
- Maximizes the valuation sum for each agent given the constraint of integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
