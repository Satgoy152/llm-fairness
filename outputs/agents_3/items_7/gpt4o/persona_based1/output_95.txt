Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  33  11  47  91   7  34
1   2   2  87  16  95  80  21
2  78  86  70  16  53  53  33
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and attempts to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the valuations, let's analyze and attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Highest valued items: 4 (91), 3 (47), 6 (34)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Highest valued items: 4 (95), 5 (80), 2 (87)

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:**
   - Highest valued items: 1 (86), 0 (78), 2 (70)

To minimize envy, a common approach is to first try to give each agent their most valued item, if possible, and then distribute the remaining items considering the next highest valuations and the overall fairness.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Assign item 3 (47) and item 6 (34)
  - Total valuation: 47 + 34 = 81

- **Agent 1:**
  - Assign item 4 (95) and item 5 (80)
  - Total valuation: 95 + 80 = 175

- **Agent 2:**
  - Assign item 0 (78), item 1 (86), and item 2 (70)
  - Total valuation: 78 + 86 + 70 = 234

This allocation attempts to respect the high valuations each agent places on specific items, while also ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value. Note that achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible, but this allocation minimizes potential envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
