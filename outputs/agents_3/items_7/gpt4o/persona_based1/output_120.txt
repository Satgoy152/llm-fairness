Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  52   6  45  78  21  29
1  10  39  67  46  43  87  70
2  56  86  47  55  86  18  38
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 39 67 46 43 87 70]
 [56 86 47 55 86 18 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair relative to their own valuations. This is a complex problem, but a simple approach is to use a method like the "round-robin" or "auction" method to distribute items while considering each agent's preferences.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  52   6  45  78  21  29
1  10  39  67  46  43  87  70
2  56  86  47  55  86  18  38
```

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritizes item 4 (value 78), then item 1 (value 52), then item 3 (value 45).
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritizes item 5 (value 87), then item 2 (value 67), then item 6 (value 70).
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritizes item 1 (value 86), then item 4 (value 86), then item 0 (value 56).

Now, let's allocate the items in a way that tries to balance their preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Item 4 (78), item 1 (52)
- **Agent 1**: Item 5 (87), item 2 (67)
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 (56), item 3 (55), item 6 (38)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one of their highly valued items, while also attempting to maintain balance across the total valuation each agent receives.

The allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [0, 3, 6]
}
```
