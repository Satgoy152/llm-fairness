Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  24  74  69  37  26  37
1   6  79  50   1  37  25  97
2  90  13  76  67  66   9  71
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[88 24 74 69 37 26 37]
 [ 6 79 50  1 37 25 97]
 [90 13 76 67 66  9 71]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the three agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their valuation while ensuring that no agent envies another agent's bundle. We'll try to balance the total value each agent receives as closely as possible.

Let's examine the valuations and consider an allocation:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items** are 0 (88), 2 (74), and 3 (69).
2. **Agent 1's highest valued items** are 6 (97), 1 (79), and 2 (50).
3. **Agent 2's highest valued items** are 0 (90), 2 (76), and 4 (66).

Now, let's propose an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1]
  - Valuation: 88 (item 0) + 24 (item 1) = 112

- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 6]
  - Valuation: 50 (item 2) + 97 (item 6) = 147

- **Agent 2**: Items [3, 4, 5]
  - Valuation: 67 (item 3) + 66 (item 4) + 9 (item 5) = 142

This allocation provides each agent with a set of items that they highly value, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to reduce envy by giving each agent a bundle of items with a high total valuation according to their preferences.
