Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  25  13   3  65  96   4
1  45  65  54  93  55  69  70
2  76  14  96  28  47   0  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents such that envy-freeness is maintained as much as possible, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. This may not always achieve perfect envy-freeness, but it aims to distribute items in a way that minimizes envy.

Here's how we can consider the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Prefers items with high values: 0 (67), 4 (65), 5 (96).
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Prefers items with high values: 3 (93), 5 (69), 6 (70).
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Prefers items with high values: 2 (96), 0 (76), 4 (47).

Based on these preferences, let's try to allocate the items:

- **Allocate item 5** to Agent 0, since they value it the most (96), and it's among the highest values.
- **Allocate item 3** to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it (93).
- **Allocate item 2** to Agent 2, since they value it the most (96).
- **Allocate item 0** to Agent 0, as they have the second-highest valuation for it (67).
- **Allocate item 6** to Agent 1, as they have a high valuation for it (70).
- **Allocate item 4** to Agent 2, since Agent 0 also values it but has already received two high-value items.
- **Allocate item 1** to Agent 1, as it is not highly valued by either Agent 0 or Agent 2, and Agent 1 already has the highest total value.

Thus, the allocation of items can be represented as:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their received items while distributing the total items fairly among all agents.
