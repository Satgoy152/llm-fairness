Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  54  68  10  84   2  52
1  74  72  30   5  15  42  72
2  90  93  16  10  93  32  59
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [90 93 16 10 93 32 59]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation if possible, or at least minimize envy. One approach to achieve this is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share relative to their valuations. 

Firstly, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(78 + 54 + 68 + 10 + 84 + 2 + 52 = 348\)
- Agent 1: \(74 + 72 + 30 + 5 + 15 + 42 + 72 = 310\)
- Agent 2: \(90 + 93 + 16 + 10 + 93 + 32 + 59 = 393\)

Next, we can consider an allocation that attempts to balance these totals and ensure each agent receives a proportionate share of their total valuation.

Let's try to allocate the items such that each agent's allocated items maximize their utility while minimizing envy:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest total valuation and places high values on items 1, 4, and 0.
2. **Agent 0** values item 4 highly, but Agent 2 gives it the same value. Agent 0 also values item 0 highly.
3. **Agent 1** has a more distributed valuation but values items 1 and 6 relatively highly.

A potential allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2]
  - Total value: \(78 + 68 = 146\)
- **Agent 1**: Items [6, 5, 3]
  - Total value: \(72 + 42 + 5 = 119\)
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 4]
  - Total value: \(93 + 93 = 186\)

This allocation attempts to distribute items based on the highest values each agent has for certain items, keeping in mind the total value each agent assigns to all items combined.

Therefore, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6, 5, 3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
