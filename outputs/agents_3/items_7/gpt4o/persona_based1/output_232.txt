Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  58  15  99  77  71  56
1  89  97  39  14   5  55   1
2  82  86  52  35  27  34  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 9 58 15 99 77 71 56]
 [89 97 39 14  5 55  1]
 [82 86 52 35 27 34 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we must aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation is one where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, based on their own valuations.

Let's analyze the situation:

### Agent Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: 
  - Values: [9, 58, 15, 99, 77, 71, 56]
- **Agent 1**:
  - Values: [89, 97, 39, 14, 5, 55, 1]
- **Agent 2**:
  - Values: [82, 86, 52, 35, 27, 34, 85]

### Strategy:
1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent** and try to allocate those items to minimize envy.
2. **Balance the number of items** allocated to each agent as evenly as possible.

### Allocation:
Based on the valuations, we can make the following allocations:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (99), item 4 (77), and item 5 (71).
- **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (97), item 0 (89), and item 5 (55).
- **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (86), item 0 (82), and item 6 (85).

### Fair Allocation:
1. Assign items based on highest valuation per agent while ensuring no overlaps:
   - **Agent 0** gets items: 3, 4
   - **Agent 1** gets items: 0, 1
   - **Agent 2** gets items: 2, 5, 6

This allocation attempts to balance the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, no overlaps occur, and it aims to minimize envy by allocating high-value items to the agents that value them most.
