Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  75  23  51  83  91  68
1  53  21  39  82  69  78  45
2  79  23   9  77  69  81  47
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with respect to their valuations, we aim for an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation. This means each agent should feel they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

One approach is to use a round-robin or "greedy" method, where agents take turns picking the item they value the most until all items are distributed. Since there are 3 agents and 7 items, each agent should end up with at least 2 items, with one agent receiving an additional item.

Let's use this approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 5 the most (91), so they pick item 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the most (82), so they pick item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the most (79), so they pick item 0.

Round 2:

4. **Agent 0**: Next highest value is for item 4 (83), so they pick item 4.
5. **Agent 1**: Next highest value is for item 5 (78), but it's taken. Next is item 4 (69), also taken. Next is item 6 (45), so they pick item 6.
6. **Agent 2**: Next highest value is for item 5 (81), but it's taken. Next is item 3 (77), but it's taken. Next is item 4 (69), but it's taken. Next is item 6 (47), but it's taken. Next is item 0 (79), but it's taken. Next is item 1 (23), so they pick item 1.

Round 3 (remaining item):

7. **Agent 0**: Remaining items are 2, their next highest value is for item 2 (23), so they pick item 2.

By following this method, we aim to achieve a fair distribution based on the agent's preferences.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items in a way that respects the agents' preferences as much as possible.
