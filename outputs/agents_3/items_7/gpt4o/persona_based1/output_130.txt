Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48   4  40  77  70  71  86
1   7  52  64  87  48   7  40
2  29   7  92  79  41  71  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 52 64 87 48  7 40]
 [29  7 92 79 41 71 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, which implies that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. One approach to achieve this is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which maximizes the product of the agents' utilities. This approach tends to produce allocations that are efficient and envy-free.

Let's consider the valuations of each agent for the items:

- Agent 0: [48, 4, 40, 77, 70, 71, 86]
- Agent 1: [7, 52, 64, 87, 48, 7, 40]
- Agent 2: [29, 7, 92, 79, 41, 71, 63]

To achieve a fair allocation, we need to balance between the agents' preferences and the total number of items allocated.

Upon analyzing the items and valuations, a possible allocation can be:

- Agent 0 receives items: [3, 4]
- Agent 1 receives items: [2, 6]
- Agent 2 receives items: [0, 1, 5]

This allocation is made considering:
- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 4, which are among the higher valuations for this agent.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 6, which are valued relatively well by this agent.
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 1, and 5, which include some of the higher valuations for this agent.

This division of items attempts to balance the total valuation received by each agent while considering the constraints of integer allocations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
