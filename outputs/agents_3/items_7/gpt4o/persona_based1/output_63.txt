Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  30  34  34  93  55  76
1   9  15  28  82  22  81  22
2  64  17  77  84  22  43  68
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can consider each agent's preferences and distribute the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction, ensuring that no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 4, 6, and 5.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most, followed by items 5 and 2.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most, followed by items 2 and 0.

A potential allocation strategy is to assign the items with the highest valuation to each agent, ensuring that each agent gets approximately equal total value and minimizing potential envy.

**Proposed Allocation:**

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 4, 6
  - Total Value: 93 (item 4) + 76 (item 6) = 169

- **Agent 1**: Assign items 3, 5, 1
  - Total Value: 82 (item 3) + 81 (item 5) + 15 (item 1) = 178

- **Agent 2**: Assign items 2, 0
  - Total Value: 77 (item 2) + 64 (item 0) = 141

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items that together provide a balanced value based on their preferences. This distribution tries to minimize envy, as each agent receives items they value highly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [3, 5, 1],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```
