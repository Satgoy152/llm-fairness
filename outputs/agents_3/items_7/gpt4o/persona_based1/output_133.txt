Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  26   8  25  71  95   6
1  86   4  95  70  26   4  48
2  55  88  24  95  88  51  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86  4 95 70 26  4 48]
 [55 88 24 95 88 51 60]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim for a distribution that minimizes envy and attempts to maximize each agent's valuation of their bundle. A common approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to one item" (EF1) criterion, where no agent will envy another agent's allocation if they can remove one item from the other's allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations and come up with a fair allocation:

1. **Agent Valuations:**

   - Agent 0: [60, 26, 8, 25, 71, 95, 6]
   - Agent 1: [86, 4, 95, 70, 26, 4, 48]
   - Agent 2: [55, 88, 24, 95, 88, 51, 60]

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - Allocate high-value items to the agents who value them the most.
   - Try to balance the overall valuation for each agent.

3. **Allocation Steps:**
   - **Item 5 (value 95 for Agent 0):** Allocate to Agent 0. This is the highest value item for them.
   - **Item 3 (value 95 for Agent 2):** Allocate to Agent 2. This is the highest value item for them.
   - **Item 2 (value 95 for Agent 1):** Allocate to Agent 1. This is the highest value item for them.
   - **Item 4 (value 88 for Agent 2):** Allocate to Agent 2. This is a high-value item for them.
   - **Item 0 (value 86 for Agent 1):** Allocate to Agent 1. This is a high-value item for them.
   - **Item 1 (value 88 for Agent 2):** Allocate to Agent 2. This complements their existing allocations.
   - **Item 6 (value 48 for Agent 1):** Allocate to Agent 1. This balances their bundle value.

Let's check the allocations to ensure each agent's bundle is valuable and that we have distributed all 7 items:

- Agent 0 has items: [5]
- Agent 1 has items: [2, 0, 6]
- Agent 2 has items: [3, 4, 1]

4. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 0, 6],
    "2": [3, 4, 1]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the high-value items among the agents while ensuring that the total number of allocated items is 7.
