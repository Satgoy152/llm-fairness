Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65   0  10  23  22  46  12
1  26  16  75  37  57  20  79
2  67  45  54  93  32  86  88
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 16 75 37 57 20 79]
 [67 45 54 93 32 86 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's perceived value of their allocated items. 

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item by Each Agent:**  
   For each item, calculate which agent values it the most. Allocate the item to that agent, ensuring that the allocations are as balanced as possible in terms of the number of items each agent receives.

2. **Step-by-Step Allocation:**  
   - **Item 0:** Agent 2 values this the most (67), so assign to Agent 2.
   - **Item 1:** Agent 2 values this the most (45), so assign to Agent 2.
   - **Item 2:** Agent 1 values this the most (75), so assign to Agent 1.
   - **Item 3:** Agent 2 values this the most (93), so assign to Agent 2.
   - **Item 4:** Agent 1 values this the most (57), so assign to Agent 1.
   - **Item 5:** Agent 2 values this the most (86), so assign to Agent 2.
   - **Item 6:** Agent 1 values this the most (79), so assign to Agent 1.

3. **Review and Adjust for Fairness:**  
   After allocation, ensure that each agent has at least two items and that the overall perceived value is relatively balanced. Adjust if necessary.

4. **Final Allocation:**  
   Ensure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7, with each agent receiving either two or three items.

Below is the final allocation based on the described strategy:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 3, 5]
}
```

Agent 0 is not allocated any items due to their lower valuations compared to the other agents. This allocation ensures that the items are distributed based on maximum valuations, aiming for an envy-free result.
