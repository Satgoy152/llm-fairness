Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  11  53   7  32  57  16
1  63  79  64  17  86  49  22
2  29  35  88  91  69  95  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items that minimizes envy among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own when considering their valuations. Given the valuations in the table, we aim to allocate the 7 items among the 3 agents in a way that each gets an integer number of items, and no one envies another based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 4 and 1.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3, 5, and 6.

A possible allocation strategy is to prioritize giving each agent the items they value the most while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate fairly:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items they value highly, such as item 0 and item 2.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items they value highly, such as item 4 and item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items they value highly, such as item 3, item 5, and item 6.

Now, let's check if this allocation is envy-free:

- **Agent 0** has items [0, 2] with total value = 91 + 53 = 144.
- **Agent 1** has items [1, 4] with total value = 79 + 86 = 165.
- **Agent 2** has items [3, 5, 6] with total value = 91 + 95 + 91 = 277.

Each agent has received some of their highly valued items, and the allocation attempts to minimize envy based on the highest valuations of each agent.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items and reflects the agents' preferences as closely as possible given their valuations.
