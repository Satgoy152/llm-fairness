Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  17  63  99  63  30  85
1  66  92   3  24  75  90  87
2  35  55  82  85  28  19  38
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[29 17 63 99 63 30 85]
 [66 92  3 24 75 90 87]
 [35 55 82 85 28 19 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what any other agent received, based on their own valuations.

Here are the valuations of each agent for all items:
- Agent 0: [29, 17, 63, 99, 63, 30, 85]
- Agent 1: [66, 92, 3, 24, 75, 90, 87]
- Agent 2: [35, 55, 82, 85, 28, 19, 38]

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 (99)
   - Second highest valued item: Item 6 (85)
   - Third highest valued item: Item 2 (63)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (92)
   - Second highest valued item: Item 5 (90)
   - Third highest valued item: Item 4 (75)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 (85)
   - Second highest valued item: Item 2 (82)
   - Third highest valued item: Item 1 (55)

### Allocating Items:
- Agent 0 gets Item 3 (highest value for any item across all agents) and Item 6 (second highest for agent 0)
- Agent 1 gets Item 1 (highest valued by agent 1) and Item 5
- Agent 2 gets Item 2 (highly valued by agent 2) and Item 4
- Leftover Item 0, which is most valued by Agent 1, will be given to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 5, 0],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their personal valuations, and all items are distributed among the agents.
