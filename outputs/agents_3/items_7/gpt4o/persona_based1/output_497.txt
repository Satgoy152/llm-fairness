Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  22  91  11  61  80  90
1   0  92  56  88  39  26  44
2  11  73  67  78  53  53  82
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 92 56 88 39 26 44]
 [11 73 67 78 53 53 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations table, we will attempt to distribute the items considering the preferences and the values each agent assigns to the items.

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can use a method similar to the "adjusted winner" procedure or simply distribute by maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's analyze and distribute:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items:** 2 (91), 6 (90), 5 (80)
2. **Agent 1's highest valued items:** 1 (92), 3 (88), 2 (56)
3. **Agent 2's highest valued items:** 3 (78), 6 (82), 2 (67)

To start, we can assign each agent one of their top-valued items and adjust from there, aiming to avoid envy.

- **Agent 0 could start with item 2 (91)**
- **Agent 1 could start with item 1 (92)**
- **Agent 2 could start with item 6 (82)**

Now let's fill in the rest:

- **Agent 0**: Item 5 (80), as it is their next high priority.
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (88), their next high priority.
- **Agent 2**: Item 4 (53), and item 0 (11), covering their remaining needs.

Now, let's ensure that all items are allocated and each agent has a satisfactory allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [2, 5]
- **Agent 1**: [1, 3]
- **Agent 2**: [6, 4, 0]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their high valuations, aiming to minimize envy.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [6, 4, 0]
}
```
