Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  70   2  49  19  71  53
1  72   1  42  88  38  21  40
2  13  31  43  47  88  98   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free or equitable distribution, where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations of the items.

Let's start by considering the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: \(81 + 70 + 2 + 49 + 19 + 71 + 53 = 345\)
- Agent 1's total value: \(72 + 1 + 42 + 88 + 38 + 21 + 40 = 302\)
- Agent 2's total value: \(13 + 31 + 43 + 47 + 88 + 98 + 4 = 324\)

We will distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total perceived value while maintaining envy-freeness. We also ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's attempt the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 5. We can assign:
   - Item 0 (81) and Item 5 (71)

2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most. Let's assign:
   - Item 3 (88) and Item 4 (38)

3. **Agent 2** highly values items 4 and 5, but since they are already allocated, we consider the next highest available:
   - Item 1 (31), Item 2 (43), and Item 6 (4)

Now, let's check if this allocation maximizes the fairness for each agent and if it is envy-free:

- **Agent 0** values their allocation at \(81 + 71 = 152\).
- **Agent 1** values their allocation at \(88 + 38 = 126\).
- **Agent 2** values their allocation at \(31 + 43 + 4 = 78\).

This distribution is not perfect in terms of envy-freeness as we have some imbalance. Let's make a slight adjustment to improve it:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items 3 and 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items 1, 4, and 6.

This allocation gives us:

- **Agent 0** values their allocation at \(81 + 71 = 152\).
- **Agent 1** values their allocation at \(88 + 42 = 130\).
- **Agent 2** values their allocation at \(31 + 88 + 4 = 123\).

This distribution seems more balanced and less envy-inducing. Below is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```
