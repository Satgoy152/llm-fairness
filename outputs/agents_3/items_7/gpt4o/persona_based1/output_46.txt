Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  29  76  12  64  19   7
1  25  28  81  89  43  17  52
2  14  15  42  21  43  91  84
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to maximize each agent's total perceived value from their allocated items. Since there are three agents and seven items, each agent should ideally receive at least two items, with one agent potentially receiving an extra item.

Let's examine the agents' preferences and try to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0's valuations**: 56, 29, 76, 12, 64, 19, 7
2. **Agent 1's valuations**: 25, 28, 81, 89, 43, 17, 52
3. **Agent 2's valuations**: 14, 15, 42, 21, 43, 91, 84

To ensure fairness and reduce envy:
- Agent 0 highly values item 2 (76) and item 4 (64).
- Agent 1 highly values item 3 (89) and item 2 (81).
- Agent 2 highly values item 5 (91) and item 6 (84).

A potential allocation could be:
- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 3
- **Agent 2**: Items 5, 6, 1

Let's check this allocation to ensure each agent's perceived value is balanced:
- Agent 0's total value: 56 (item 0) + 64 (item 4) = 120
- Agent 1's total value: 81 (item 2) + 89 (item 3) = 170
- Agent 2's total value: 91 (item 5) + 84 (item 6) + 15 (item 1) = 190

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value among the agents, considering each agent's highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 6, 1]
}
```
