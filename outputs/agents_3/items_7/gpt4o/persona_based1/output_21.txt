Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  83  46  33  43  82  58
1  89  79  94  86  80  49  65
2  80  50  82  32  34  28  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the items among the agents in a way that is as fair as possible. There are several methods for fair division, but given the constraint of integer allocations and looking for envy-freeness, we can use a heuristic approach to minimize envy and optimize for fairness.

One approach is to use the "maximum envy-free allocation" method, where we aim to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This can be challenging with integer allocations, but we can try to minimize envy by selecting allocations that maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that no agent is envious of another.

Let's analyze the valuations given:

```
Agent 0: [65, 83, 46, 33, 43, 82, 58]
Agent 1: [89, 79, 94, 86, 80, 49, 65]
Agent 2: [80, 50, 82, 32, 34, 28, 94]
```

We will try to allocate items such that:

1. Each agent gets at least one item.
2. The allocation is envy-free or minimizes envy as much as possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Assign item 1 (83) and item 5 (82) to Agent 0, as these are high-value items for them.
- Assign item 2 (94) and item 4 (80) to Agent 1, as these are high-value items for them.
- Assign item 0 (80), item 3 (32), and item 6 (94) to Agent 2, as these are high-value or relatively high-value items for them.

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives and minimizes the potential for envy.

The final allocation presented in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and attempts to minimize envy by considering individual valuations.
