Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  79  19  90  92  95  84
1  52  39  16  24  88  56  85
2  62  89   5  90   4  81  73
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[15 79 19 90 92 95 84]
 [52 39 16 24 88 56 85]
 [62 89  5 90  4 81 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we'll consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Envy-freeness means no agent should feel that another agent has received a better allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate items step by step:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** [15, 79, 19, 90, 92, 95, 84]
2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** [52, 39, 16, 24, 88, 56, 85]
3. **Agent 2's Valuations:** [62, 89, 5, 90, 4, 81, 73]

### Allocation Process

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest value items: 5 (95), 4 (92), 3 (90)
  - Allocate item 5 and item 4 to Agent 0. These are among the highest for Agent 0 and other agents have relatively lower valuations for these.

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest value items: 4 (88), 6 (85), 0 (52)
  - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1. Item 6 is highly valued by Agent 1 compared to others.

- **Agent 2:**
  - Highest value items: 1 (89), 3 (90), 5 (81)
  - Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 2. These are highly valued by Agent 2.

Now we re-evaluate the remaining items:

- Items left: 0, 2
- **Agent 0** values item 0 at 15 and item 2 at 19.
- **Agent 1** values item 0 at 52 and item 2 at 16.
- **Agent 2** values item 0 at 62 and item 2 at 5.

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value) and item 2 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest valuations and tries to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of their most valued items, aiming for envy-freeness.
