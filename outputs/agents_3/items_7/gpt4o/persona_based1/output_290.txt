Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  77  36  48   8  93  58
1  69  75  51  48  43   6  59
2  17  48  44  75  12  64  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 77 36 48  8 93 58]
 [69 75 51 48 43  6 59]
 [17 48 44 75 12 64 28]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we'll aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations while also ensuring that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. Given the valuations table, we can use the following approach to allocate the items:

1. **List the valuations for each agent and item:**
   - Agent 0: [27, 77, 36, 48, 8, 93, 58]
   - Agent 1: [69, 75, 51, 48, 43, 6, 59]
   - Agent 2: [17, 48, 44, 75, 12, 64, 28]

2. **Assign items based on highest valuations while trying to ensure envy-freeness:**
   - Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, but try to balance the total value each agent receives.

3. **Allocate items:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (69).
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (77).
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (51).
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (75).
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (43).
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (93).
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (58).

4. **Check allocations and adjust if necessary to ensure fairness:**
   - Agent 0 gets items [1, 5, 6].
   - Agent 1 gets items [0, 2, 4].
   - Agent 2 gets item [3].

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items that they highly value, while also ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The total value each agent receives is balanced as much as possible.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
