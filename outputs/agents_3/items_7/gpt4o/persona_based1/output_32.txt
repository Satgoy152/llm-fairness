Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  93  98  35  54  30  37
1  18   8  33  88  15  83  41
2  14  79  35  45  85  74  35
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate the items to the agents in such a way that the allocation is fair and envy-free, if possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the nature of the problem, it might not be possible to achieve perfect envy-freeness, but we will aim for an allocation that is as fair as possible given the agents' valuations.

Let's consider the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [30, 93, 98, 35, 54, 30, 37]
- Agent 1: [18, 8, 33, 88, 15, 83, 41]
- Agent 2: [14, 79, 35, 45, 85, 74, 35]

A common approach is to attempt to maximize each agent's total valuation while considering fairness. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2 and item 1.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3 and item 5.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 and a relatively high value for item 6.

Now, let's allocate the items based on these observations:

- Assign item 2 and item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 and item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

After this, we have the items 0 and 6 remaining unallocated. To complete the allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (since it has a higher valuation compared to other agents for this item).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 has a slightly higher valuation for item 6 compared to Agent 0 and is left with fewer items.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2
- Agent 1: Items 3, 5, 6
- Agent 2: Item 4

This allocation tries to balance the distribution of items while considering the agents' preferences.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [4]
}
```
