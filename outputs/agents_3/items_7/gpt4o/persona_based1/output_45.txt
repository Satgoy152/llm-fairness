Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  32  31  75  63  71  11
1  49  54  16  65  63  83  32
2  63  31  22   7   9  83  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use an approach that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how we could approach this:

1. **Identify the total value each agent places on all items**:
   - Agent 0: \( 58 + 32 + 31 + 75 + 63 + 71 + 11 = 341 \)
   - Agent 1: \( 49 + 54 + 16 + 65 + 63 + 83 + 32 = 362 \)
   - Agent 2: \( 63 + 31 + 22 + 7 + 9 + 83 + 95 = 310 \)

2. **Assign the items while considering the highest value each agent places on individual items**:
   - Prioritize allocations by giving each agent their most valued items first, ensuring no agent receives less than others in terms of perceived value.

3. **Perform the allocation**:
   - Agent 0:
     - Highest value items: 3 (75), 5 (71)
   - Agent 1:
     - Highest value items: 5 (83), 3 (65)
   - Agent 2:
     - Highest value items: 6 (95), 5 (83)

   Based on the above, we need to ensure that each agent gets a balanced allocation. After resolving conflicts where multiple agents highly value the same item, the optimal allocation would look like this:

   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (75) and item 5 to Agent 1 (83).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (95).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (63), as it's their second-highest value after item 6.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (54).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (63).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (31).

With these considerations, the fair allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 2],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [6, 0]
}
```

This allocation should aim to minimize envy and maximize overall satisfaction based on the valuations provided.
