Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  13  12  34  72  19  52
1  63  96  13   9  68  85  71
2  82  90  46  53  84  39  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute them such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own preferences.

Here's one potential allocation that attempts to achieve this, considering the valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 0 the highest (89), followed by item 4 (72). To maximize agent 0's satisfaction, we can give them item 0 and item 4.
2. **Agent 1:** Has the highest valuation for item 1 (96), followed by item 5 (85). Allocating these items to agent 1 maximizes their satisfaction.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 2 the highest (46), followed by item 3 (53). Assigning these items to agent 2 will be beneficial.

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

- Assign item 0 and item 4 to agent 0.
- Assign item 1 and item 5 to agent 1.
- Assign item 2 and item 3 to agent 2.
- Assign the remaining item 6 to agent 2 to balance the number of items.

This allocation respects each agent's preferences to a reasonable extent and distributes all the items.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
