Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  15  53  49  49  57  26
1  73  77   0  65  21   5  44
2  91  77  58   4  23  26  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to find a distribution that attempts to minimize envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the matrix of valuations, let's proceed to allocate the items.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

```
Agent\Item |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6
----------------------------------------------
Agent 0    |  9 | 15 | 53 | 49 | 49 | 57 | 26
Agent 1    | 73 | 77 |  0 | 65 | 21 |  5 | 44
Agent 2    | 91 | 77 | 58 |  4 | 23 | 26 | 99
```

To create an allocation that is as fair as possible with respect to these valuations, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Individual Preferences**: Try to allocate each agent at least one item they highly value.

2. **Ensure Envy-Freeness as much as possible**: Make sure no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation by trying to balance out the perceived value.

Let's start by making allocations:

- **Agent 2** highly values items 0 and 6 (91 and 99, respectively). Allocating these items to Agent 2 can maximize their utility.
- **Agent 1** highly values items 1 and 3 (77 and 65, respectively). Allocating these items to Agent 1 can maximize their utility.
- **Agent 0** can be allocated items 2, 4, and 5. Although Agent 0 values these items less than other items, they are the best remaining options for a fair distribution.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 2, 4, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 6.

This allocation considers the highest priorities for each agent, attempting to maximize fairness and minimize envy.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 6]
}
```
