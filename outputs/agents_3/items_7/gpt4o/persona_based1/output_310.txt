Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  70  95  68  82  78  97
1  34  88  55  57  63  42   9
2  97   2  68  11  98  65  68
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 70 95 68 82 78 97]
 [34 88 55 57 63 42  9]
 [97  2 68 11 98 65 68]]
Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation among the three agents, we aim to distribute items such that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as any other agent. A common approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items, ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation based on their own valuation.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most.
3. **Agent 2** values items 0 and 4 highly.

Considering these preferences, we can propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2, 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 3
- **Agent 2**: Items 4, 5

This allocation is done such that:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 6, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives item 1, which is their highest-valued item, and item 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 4 and 5, with item 4 being their highest-valued item.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maintain fairness by considering each agent's preferences.
