Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  89  96  35  96  24  53
1  66  86  58  67  26  76   2
2  28  44  43  45  70  93  72
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and try to distribute them in a way that minimizes envy. One approach is to use the "adjusted winner" procedure or a similar heuristic that considers the agents' preferences.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [12, 89, 96, 35, 96, 24, 53]
Agent 1: [66, 86, 58, 67, 26, 76, 2]
Agent 2: [28, 44, 43, 45, 70, 93, 72]
```

A straightforward heuristic approach is to allocate the highest valued item to each agent one by one, ensuring that all items are distributed.

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 and item 4 the most (96 each), but item 2 is slightly more valuable to Agent 1 (58).
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most (66).
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the most (93).

Following these observations, we can start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent and then distribute the remaining items by considering the next highest values while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (to cover the value of 96).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value of 86, which is second highest after 0).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value of 72, which is second highest after 5).

Now we are left with item 3. Agent 1 values it the most, so we assign item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation should be balanced, considering the valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated without leaving any unassigned.
