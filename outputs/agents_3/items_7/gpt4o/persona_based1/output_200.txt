Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61   3  80  79  78  81  14
1  68  98  79  26  70  36  69
2   2  11   4  90  77  71  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[61  3 80 79 78 81 14]
 [68 98 79 26 70 36 69]
 [ 2 11  4 90 77 71 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible, where each agent feels they received a bundle of items at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle according to their own valuation. Given the input table, let's analyze the valuations and work towards a fair distribution.

Here's how the agents value the items:

- **Agent 0**: 61, 3, 80, 79, 78, 81, 14
- **Agent 1**: 68, 98, 79, 26, 70, 36, 69
- **Agent 2**: 2, 11, 4, 90, 77, 71, 14

First, let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items to understand their overall valuation perspectives:

- **Total valuation for Agent 0**: 61 + 3 + 80 + 79 + 78 + 81 + 14 = 396
- **Total valuation for Agent 1**: 68 + 98 + 79 + 26 + 70 + 36 + 69 = 446
- **Total valuation for Agent 2**: 2 + 11 + 4 + 90 + 77 + 71 + 14 = 269

Now, let's try to allocate the items to maximize fairness, considering that each agent should ideally receive a similar share of value based on their own valuations.

A possible allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 4 (Values: 80, 78)
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 5, 6 (Values: 98, 36, 69)
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 3 (Values: 2, 90)

Checking the allocations:

- **Agent 0**'s bundle value: 80 + 78 = 158
- **Agent 1**'s bundle value: 98 + 36 + 69 = 203
- **Agent 2**'s bundle value: 2 + 90 = 92

Even though absolute fairness (envy-freeness) is challenging to achieve due to the disparity in total valuations, this allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives according to their own valuations. Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
