Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  32  31  21  58  50  97
1  56  72  54  43  89  86   2
2  63  30  56  78  92  71  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 30 56 78 92 71 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that ensures envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate the Total Valuation for Each Agent:**  
   - Agent 0: 55 + 32 + 31 + 21 + 58 + 50 + 97 = 344
   - Agent 1: 56 + 72 + 54 + 43 + 89 + 86 + 2 = 402
   - Agent 2: 63 + 30 + 56 + 78 + 92 + 71 + 76 = 466

2. **Identify the High-Value Items for Each Agent:**  
   - Agent 0: Items with the highest values are 6, 4, 0
   - Agent 1: Items with the highest values are 4, 5, 1
   - Agent 2: Items with the highest values are 4, 3, 0

3. **Assign Items to Agents to Maximize Fairness:**  
   We need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's aim for a balanced allocation:

   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0, which is their most valued item.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1, which is their most valued item.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2, which is highly valued by Agent 2.

   These initial allocations ensure each agent gets one of their top-valued items:
   - Agent 0: [6]
   - Agent 1: [4]
   - Agent 2: [3]

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**  
   - Items left: 0, 1, 2, 5
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (second-highest valued for Agent 2, and highly valued by Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (second-highest valued for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (third-highest valued for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (this balances the allocation count).

5. **Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [4, 5, 1],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value items among the agents while ensuring that all items are distributed.
