Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  76  35  98   5  40   1
1  39  26  21  60   2  16   9
2  78  37  55  71  75  50  79
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that aims to minimize envy. One approach is to use the Envy-Free Allocation method, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. While strict envy-freeness may not always be possible, we aim to minimize envy as much as possible.

Given the valuation matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 95     | 76     | 35     | 98     | 5      | 40     | 1      |
| 1     | 39     | 26     | 21     | 60     | 2      | 16     | 9      |
| 2     | 78     | 37     | 55     | 71     | 75     | 50     | 79     |

We'll aim to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring a fair distribution. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has very high values for items 0, 1, and 3. Allocating items 0 and 3 to Agent 0 gives them significant value.
2. Agent 1 has relatively low values across the board, but they value item 3 the most. However, since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, we aim for other items that provide reasonable value.
3. Agent 2 values items 4, 6, and 0 highly. Since item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can allocate items 4 and 6 to Agent 2.

After considering these priorities, the allocation can be as follows:

- Allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 0.
- Allocate items 5 and 2 to Agent 1.
- Allocate items 1, 4, and 6 to Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to satisfy the preferences of each agent as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, with each item assigned to one agent.
