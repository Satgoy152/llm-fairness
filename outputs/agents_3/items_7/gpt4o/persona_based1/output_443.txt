Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  21  85  69  87  47  75
1  82  49  40  18  43   1  54
2  51  24  20  73  30   5  27
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to consider each agent's valuations and try to achieve an envy-free distribution where possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations. Given the constraints, we also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **List the total valuation each agent has for all items:**

   - Agent 0: \(13 + 21 + 85 + 69 + 87 + 47 + 75 = 397\)
   - Agent 1: \(82 + 49 + 40 + 18 + 43 + 1 + 54 = 287\)
   - Agent 2: \(51 + 24 + 20 + 73 + 30 + 5 + 27 = 230\)

2. **Attempt to distribute items so that each agent has the highest possible total valuation of their allocations, while keeping the allocation envy-free:**

   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest, and item 2 second highest.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest, and item 6 second highest.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest.

3. **Allocate items based on the highest valuations and attempt to balance:**

   - Allocate item 4 to agent 0 (value 87) and item 2 (value 85).
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 1 (value 82) and item 6 (value 54).
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 2 (value 73).

4. **Allocate remaining items by considering second preferences:**

   - Remaining items to allocate: 1, 5.
   - Agent 0's next highest value item is 6, but it’s already allocated. The next is item 1.
   - Agent 1's next highest is 1, but it’s also the next highest unallocated for agent 0.
   - Agent 2's next highest is item 0, which is already allocated.
   - Give item 1 to agent 0 because it’s the next best for both agent 0 and agent 1, but agent 0 has more total value.
   - Give item 5 to agent 2 as it’s not strongly preferred by others.

Thus, the allocation can be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 1],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance valuation and ensure each agent has a fair share based on their preferences.
