Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  84   2  17  17  69  74
1  65  37   7  22  27   3  93
2   9  17  93  12  93  13  35
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims for envy-freeness among the agents, we can use the Maximum Marginal Return (MMR) approach to allocate items. This involves assigning items to agents based on maximizing their marginal utility incrementally.

Let's analyze the given valuations and allocate items one by one:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 1 (84), 6 (74), 5 (69).
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 6 (93), 0 (65), 4 (27).
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: 2 (93), 4 (93), 6 (35).

We'll allocate items one by one, aiming to maximize the marginal gain for each agent:

1. **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value 93).
2. **Item 6**: Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value 93).
3. **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 0 (highest value 84).
4. **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value 93).
5. **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 1 (next highest value 65).
6. **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 0 (next highest value 69).
7. **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 0 (remaining item).

Now, let's check the allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 5, 3
- Agent 1: Items 6, 0
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4

This allocation gives each agent a fairly balanced share based on their valuations, reducing overall envy as much as possible.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 3],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
