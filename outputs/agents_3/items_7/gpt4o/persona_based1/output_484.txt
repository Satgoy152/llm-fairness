Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66   8  56  28  64  40  81
1  76  32  49  17  72  86  23
2  56  76  62  61  89   3  40
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which is known for achieving a balance between efficiency and fairness.

Here's a step-by-step approach to find an allocation:

1. **Calculate each agent's total valuation for all items**:
   - Agent 0: 66 + 8 + 56 + 28 + 64 + 40 + 81 = 343
   - Agent 1: 76 + 32 + 49 + 17 + 72 + 86 + 23 = 355
   - Agent 2: 56 + 76 + 62 + 61 + 89 + 3 + 40 = 387

2. **Assign items to maximize fairness and efficiency**:
   - We aim to allocate items so that each agent receives a set that maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring no agent envies another. This is a complex problem that often requires iterative methods or heuristics.

3. **Initial allocation strategy**:
   - Start by assigning high-value items to agents who value them most, and then try to balance the total value each agent receives.

4. **Iterate to adjust allocations for fairness**:
   - Adjust allocations to avoid envy by ensuring each agent's allocation is as valuable as possible relative to others.

Applying this approach, here is one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 5] 
  - Total value: 66 (for item 0) + 40 (for item 5) = 106

- **Agent 1**: [1, 6] 
  - Total value: 32 (for item 1) + 23 (for item 6) = 55

- **Agent 2**: [2, 3, 4] 
  - Total value: 62 (for item 2) + 61 (for item 3) + 89 (for item 4) = 212

This allocation considers the highest values each agent places on items and attempts to ensure no agent envies another based on the allocation they received.

Now, presenting the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, attempting to balance the total value each agent receives to promote fairness.
