Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95   8  65  10  89  19   0
1  54  99  61  77  40  66  62
2   8  58  45  66  52  10  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to balance the distribution of items according to each agent's valuations. We aim to minimize envy by ensuring each agent gets a reasonable value based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 (95) most.
- Agent 1 values item 1 (99) most.
- Agent 2 values item 3 (66) most.

To achieve a fair allocation, we can start by assigning each agent their highest-valued available item, if possible, and then distribute the remaining items to balance the value received by each agent.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it is their highest-valued item.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it is their highest-valued item.
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it provides them with the next highest value (89).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, increasing their total value.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it provides additional value.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as it is the only item remaining and provides some value.

Final allocation based on fair distribution:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets some of their higher-valued items, aiming to minimize envy among them.

The JSON representation of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```
