Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  53  94  75  82   9  19
1  66  75  56  77   7  22  64
2  95  11   4   6  51  67  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. One common approach is to use the concept of the "envy-free" allocation if possible, or at least a fair division where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

To achieve this, we can use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Valuations**: Determine the total valuation each agent has for all items combined.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Assign items by matching each agent with the item they value the most, while ensuring each item is only allocated once. 

3. **Iterate to Improve**: Adjust the allocation to attempt to achieve envy-freeness, if possible. This often means swapping items between agents to balance their perceived values.

4. **Check for Completeness**: Ensure all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item.

Let's go through these steps:

### Total Valuations

- **Agent 0**: 82 + 53 + 94 + 75 + 82 + 9 + 19 = 414
- **Agent 1**: 66 + 75 + 56 + 77 + 7 + 22 + 64 = 367
- **Agent 2**: 95 + 11 + 4 + 6 + 51 + 67 + 94 = 328

### Initial Allocation

- **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (94).
- **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (77).
- **Agent 2** values item 0 the most (95).

### Improving Allocation
- Assign the remaining items based on the next highest valuations for each agent while considering the total value each agent will have.

Let's allocate the remaining items:

1. **Agent 0**: Already has item 2 (value 94). Next highest are items 0 (82) and 4 (82).
2. **Agent 1**: Already has item 3 (value 77). Next highest are items 1 (75) and 6 (64).
3. **Agent 2**: Already has item 0 (value 95). Next highest are items 6 (94) and 5 (67).

Assign items to balance the perceived total values:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2 (94), 4 (82)
- **Agent 1**: Items 3 (77), 1 (75), 5 (22)
- **Agent 2**: Items 0 (95), 6 (94)

### Final Allocation
After the allocation, let's represent this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3, 1, 5],
    "2": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and the agents receive a fair share based on their preferences.
