Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  36  41  28  10  53  87
1  53  17  98  36  68  66  70
2  12  68  15  26  40  99  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

One common approach to ensure fairness is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum envy or ensuring Pareto efficiency. We will aim to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is maximized according to their preferences, while ensuring no agent feels that another agent received a significantly better allocation given their own valuation.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent would receive under possible allocations and choose one that attempts to balance these values.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for item 6 (87), item 5 (53), and item 0 (41).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for item 2 (98), item 6 (70), and item 5 (66).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for item 5 (99), item 6 (70), and item 1 (68).

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 3
  - Total value: 41 + 36 + 28 = 105
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 4
  - Total value: 98 + 68 = 166
- **Agent 2**: Items 5, 6
  - Total value: 99 + 70 = 169

This allocation aims to distribute the items such that each agent receives a set that provides them with a fair share based on their individual valuations.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a portion of the items that reflects their highest preferences within the constraints of the problem.
