Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  20  81  37   8  34  68
1  33   5  95  79  95  93   2
2  63  50  73  59  92  28  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33  5 95 79 95 93  2]
 [63 50 73 59 92 28 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations and to ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and assign the items in a way that minimizes envy. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations, we can start by considering the highest valued items for each agent and allocate them accordingly. The goal is to ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 0 (94), 2 (81), 6 (68) highly.
- Agent 1 values items: 2 (95), 4 (95), 5 (93) highly.
- Agent 2 values items: 4 (92), 2 (73), 0 (63) highly.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Item 2:** Highest value for Agent 1 (95). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 0:** Highest value for Agent 0 (94). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 4:** Highest value for Agent 1 (95), but let's consider Agent 2 who also values item 4 highly. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 5:** Next highest for Agent 1 (93). Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 6:** Next highest for Agent 0 (68). Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
6. **Item 3:** Consider remaining allocations. Agent 1 values item 3 (79) highly. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
7. **Item 1:** Remaining item. Allocate to Agent 2, who values it (50), more than Agent 1 (5).

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences while ensuring that all items are distributed and minimizing envy.
