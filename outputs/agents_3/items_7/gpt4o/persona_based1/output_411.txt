Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  30  82  62  34  36  46
1  80  26  16  96   0  16  84
2  56  95  57  64   0  57  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 30 82 62 34 36 46]
 [80 26 16 96  0 16 84]
 [56 95 57 64  0 57 85]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate all 7 items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to others, minimizing envy.

Here are the valuations for quick reference:

- Agent 0: [91, 30, 82, 62, 34, 36, 46]
- Agent 1: [80, 26, 16, 96, 0, 16, 84]
- Agent 2: [56, 95, 57, 64, 0, 57, 85]

One approach to ensure a fair division is the "Greedy Envy-Free" method. This method involves assigning items to agents in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation of their assigned items, while guaranteeing that no agent envies another based on their own valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify the highest-valued item for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the most.

2. **Assign these highest-valued items to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 0.
   - Agent 1 gets item 3.
   - Agent 2 gets item 1.

3. **Allocate the remaining items by iteratively assigning the next highest-valued item to the agent who values it the most and hasn't already received it:**
   - Remaining items: 2, 4, 5, 6.

4. **Allocate item 6** (valued highest by Agent 1 after item 3):
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

5. **Allocate item 2** (valued highest by Agent 0 after item 0):
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

6. **Allocate item 5** (valued highest by Agent 2 after item 1):
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

7. **Allocate item 4** (valued highest by Agent 0):
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

The allocation ensures that each agent receives items such that their total value is as high as possible given the constraints, minimizing envy.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
