Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  95  35  69   3  85  60
1  52  48  23  67  23  78  35
2  18  63  97  88  76  88  97
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation of the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is a step-by-step approach to reach a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:** This will help us understand which agent values each item the most.
2. **Assign items based on highest valuation:** We will start by assigning each item to the agent who values it most, provided it does not lead to an unfair distribution of total value (or number of items).

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- **Item 0:** Valuations are 72, 52, 18. Agent 0 values it the most.
- **Item 1:** Valuations are 95, 48, 63. Agent 0 values it the most.
- **Item 2:** Valuations are 35, 23, 97. Agent 2 values it the most.
- **Item 3:** Valuations are 69, 67, 88. Agent 2 values it the most.
- **Item 4:** Valuations are 3, 23, 76. Agent 2 values it the most.
- **Item 5:** Valuations are 85, 78, 88. Agent 2 values it the most.
- **Item 6:** Valuations are 60, 35, 97. Agent 2 values it the most.

Now, let's allocate items:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for items 0 and 1.
2. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for items 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

However, if Agent 2 takes all items they value most, it would lead to an uneven distribution. We need to balance the allocation:

- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation after Agent 2).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation after Agent 2).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation after Agent 2).

This distribution attempts to balance the number of items and values received by each agent.

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items, ensuring that all 7 items are distributed.
