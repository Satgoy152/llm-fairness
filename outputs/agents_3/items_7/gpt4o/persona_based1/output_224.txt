Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  67  35  91  22  64   2
1   0  64  67  44  70  15  86
2  31  72  57  38  83  68  84
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 64 67 44 70 15 86]
 [31 72 57 38 83 68 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum envy or ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly relative to the others. Given the valuations matrix, let's try to allocate items such that the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

### Valuation Matrix
- Agent 0: [88, 67, 35, 91, 22, 64, 2]
- Agent 1: [0, 64, 67, 44, 70, 15, 86]
- Agent 2: [31, 72, 57, 38, 83, 68, 84]

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 the highest.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest and has relatively high valuations for items 1 and 5.

### Allocation Process
- Assign items based on the highest value each agent places on them, ensuring that no item is assigned to more than one agent.

### Proposed Allocation
- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 3]
  - Item 0 is valued the highest by Agent 0 (88).
  - Item 3 is also highly valued by Agent 0 (91).

- **Agent 1**: Items [6]
  - Item 6 is valued the highest by Agent 1 (86).

- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 2, 4, 5]
  - Item 4 is valued the highest by Agent 2 (83).
  - Item 1 is also highly valued by Agent 2 (72).
  - Item 2 is valued reasonably by Agent 2 (57).
  - Item 5 is valued reasonably by Agent 2 (68).

This allocation attempts to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, thereby aiming for minimal envy.

### Allocations (in JSON format)
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
