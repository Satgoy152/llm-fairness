Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  28  20  58  68  19  82
1  55  34  21  23  53  90  76
2   5  57  23  21  45  95  16
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming to minimize envy, we can use a strategy that considers the agents' valuations for each item. One common approach is to use a round-robin allocation method based on the agents' valuations. We will try to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly while maintaining a balanced distribution.

Let's outline a possible allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (82).
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (90).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (95), but since item 5 is already chosen by Agent 1, we should consider their second-highest valuation, which is item 1 (57).

2. **Assign these items to each agent**:
   - Agent 0 gets item 6.
   - Agent 1 gets item 5.
   - Agent 2 gets item 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Consider remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 4.
   - Assign based on remaining valuations:
     - Agent 0 values item 0 highly (60), so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
     - Agent 1 values item 4 highly (53), so assign item 4 to Agent 1.
     - Agent 2 values item 2 highly (23), so assign item 2 to Agent 2.
     - Agent 0 values item 3 (58), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.

4. **Final allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 6
   - Agent 1: Items 4, 5
   - Agent 2: Items 1, 2

Now, let's put this allocation into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
