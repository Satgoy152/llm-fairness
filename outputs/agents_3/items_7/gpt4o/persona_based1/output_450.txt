Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  31  37  74  84  78  13
1  55  63  71  32  66  86  19
2  27  64  91  20  53   8  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness in mind, we should aim to allocate items such that each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as they would value any other agent's bundle. This task can be complex due to the discrete nature of item allocation. However, we can make a reasonable attempt to balance the allocations based on their valuations.

Let's begin by examining the agents' preferences for each item:

- Agent 0 values most item 4 (84), followed by item 5 (78).
- Agent 1 values most item 5 (86), followed by item 2 (71).
- Agent 2 values most item 2 (91), followed by item 1 (64).

Given these preferences, we can attempt to assign the most valued items to each agent to start with:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0, 1, 3, and 6:

- Agent 0 could use additional items to balance the allocation since they have only one item.
- Agent 1 and Agent 2 each have one high-valued item already.

Let's try to distribute the remaining items to balance the perceived value:

- Assign item 0 (value 58) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 (value 64) to Agent 2 for high value.
- Assign item 3 (value 32) to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 (value 22) to Agent 2 for balancing.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 has items 4 and 0 (values 84 and 58).
- Agent 1 has items 5 and 3 (values 86 and 32).
- Agent 2 has items 2, 1, and 6 (values 91, 64, and 22).

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [2, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute items fairly based on their valuations, ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share of what they value highly.
