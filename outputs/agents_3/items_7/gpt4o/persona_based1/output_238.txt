Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  24  60  47  93  41  94
1  88  49  54  90  77  11  83
2  19  15  89  88  84  69  79
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means each agent values their own bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle.

Given the agents' valuations, a possible approach is to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that every agent feels they are getting a fair share of the total value. Let's start by analyzing and allocating the items based on the highest value each agent places on them.

### Analysis of Valuations:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest valuations: Item 6 (94), Item 4 (93), Item 0 (66)
- **Agent 1**: 
  - Highest valuations: Item 0 (88), Item 3 (90)
- **Agent 2**: 
  - Highest valuations: Item 2 (89), Item 3 (88), Item 4 (84)

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Assign Item 6** to Agent 0 (highest value by Agent 0).
2. **Assign Item 0** to Agent 1 (highest value by Agent 1 and second-highest by Agent 0).
3. **Assign Item 2** to Agent 2 (highest value by Agent 2).

Continuing with this pattern, we consider the next highest unallocated values:

4. **Assign Item 4** to Agent 2 (high value by Agent 2).
5. **Assign Item 3** to Agent 1 (high value by Agent 1).
6. **Assign Item 1** to Agent 0 (next highest available value by Agent 0).
7. **Assign Item 5** to Agent 2 (next highest available value by Agent 2).

Each agent should get at least some items, and the allocations should be done such that no agent envies another's allocation significantly.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' preferences, ensuring each agent gets a share that maximizes their individual satisfaction and minimizes envy.
