Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  69  84  17  12  79  35
1  84  95  62  38  25  80  52
2  27  61  57  28  28  93  56
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that each agent perceives their allocated set of items as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - [0: 91, 1: 69, 2: 84, 3: 17, 4: 12, 5: 79, 6: 35]

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - [0: 84, 1: 95, 2: 62, 3: 38, 4: 25, 5: 80, 6: 52]

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:**
   - [0: 27, 1: 61, 2: 57, 3: 28, 4: 28, 5: 93, 6: 56]

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Prefers items with high values. Assign items 0 (91) and 2 (84), as they have significantly higher values for Agent 0 compared to other items.
- **Agent 1**: Highly values item 1. Assign item 1 (95) to Agent 1, as it is the most valuable to them.
- **Agent 2**: Prefers item 5 (93) and also item 6 (56). Assign these items to Agent 2, as they are highly valued by them.
- The remaining items 3 and 4 can be distributed to Agent 1, who values them more than Agent 0 and close to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value, minimizing potential envy between agents.
