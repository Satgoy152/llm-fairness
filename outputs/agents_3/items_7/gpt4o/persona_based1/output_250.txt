Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  49  58  34  35  98  90
1  50  37   3  59  53  52  92
2  34  42  65  47  75  46  30
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[47 49 58 34 35 98 90]
 [50 37  3 59 53 52 92]
 [34 42 65 47 75 46 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that balances the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation. This is a challenging problem, but we can attempt a solution that seeks to minimize envy by evaluating the agents' valuations for each item and trying to distribute the items to maximize fairness.

Firstly, let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [47, 49, 58, 34, 35, 98, 90]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [50, 37, 3, 59, 53, 52, 92]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [34, 42, 65, 47, 75, 46, 30]

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Highest Valuation Items**: 
   - Item 5 has the highest valuation (98) by Agent 0.
   - Item 6 has a high valuation (92) by Agent 1.
   - Item 4 has a high valuation (75) by Agent 2.

2. **Allocating High Value Items**:
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0 (98).
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1 (92).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2 (75).

3. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items left: [0, 1, 2, 3]

4. **Distribution of Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0 highly values Item 2 (58), so allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 (59), so allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values Item 1 (42), so allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.
   - The remaining Item 0 can be allocated to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it more than Agent 2 does.

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations for each agent and minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives some of their highly valued items.

**Final Allocation**:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a set of items that should reduce envy and provide a fair division according to their valuations.
