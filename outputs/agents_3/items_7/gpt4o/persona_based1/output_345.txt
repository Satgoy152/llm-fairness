Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  70  41  44   5  38  20
1  10  77   6  49  16  40  10
2  50  57  76  61  72   3  47
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. This is a complex problem, but we can aim for a solution that minimizes potential envy, given that perfect envy-freeness may not be feasible with the current valuations.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: They value item 1 the most (70), followed by item 0 (42). To maximize their satisfaction, we allocate these items to them.
2. **Agent 1**: They value item 1 the most (77), but since it's already allocated, we consider their next highest-valued items, which are item 5 (40) and item 3 (49). We allocate these items to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Their highest value is item 2 (76), and their next highest value is item 4 (72). We allocate these items to them.

After this initial allocation, some items remain unallocated: item 6 and item 3. 

- Re-evaluating, Agent 2 values item 6 more than the other agents do, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
- Finally, item 3 is valued significantly by Agent 1, so we allocate it to Agent 1.

After reevaluation, the allocations are as follows:

- **Agent 0** receives items 0 and 1.
- **Agent 1** receives items 3 and 5.
- **Agent 2** receives items 2, 4, and 6.

This allocation attempts to respect the agents' preferences as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
