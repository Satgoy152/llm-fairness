Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  34  23  49  97  77  17
1  70  48   5  78  32  17  34
2  65  14  53  22  43  87  39
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, I will use the concept of "envy-freeness" in fair division, which seeks to distribute items such that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle, given their individual valuations. We'll aim to achieve a fair division where each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations provided and try to find an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. 

Here's a strategy to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Look for items that have significantly higher valuations for one agent compared to the others. These items should ideally be allocated to those agents to minimize potential envy.

2. **Allocate Based on Preferences:** Distribute the remaining items by analyzing which agent values them most, while keeping in mind the overall value of the bundle for each agent.

3. **Ensure Completeness:** Make sure all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Following this strategy, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0 and 4. Allocating these items to Agent 0 is ideal.
- **Agent 1**: Has high valuation for item 3. Allocating item 3 to Agent 1 is ideal.
- **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 5 and 6. Allocating these items to Agent 2 is ideal.

Now, distribute the remaining items (1 and 2) to ensure envy-freeness or minimal envy:

- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item more than the other agents, so it goes to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values this item more than Agent 0, so it goes to Agent 2.

Let's summarize the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 4]
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 1]
- **Agent 2**: Items [5, 6, 2]

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [5, 6, 2]
}
```
