Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70   0  65  88  64  86  89
1  79  66   8  25  46  91   2
2  57  19   6  33  10  84  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction among agents. Satisfaction can be represented by the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. A possible approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use a method like the "round-robin" or "max-min fair share" allocation. Here, I will try to allocate items so that each agent is as satisfied as possible given their preferences.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. We'll start by calculating each agent's total value for all items to get an idea of their overall preferences.
2. We will then attempt to distribute the items such that the total utility for each agent is balanced.

### Total Valuation for Each Agent:
- Agent 0's total valuation: 70 + 0 + 65 + 88 + 64 + 86 + 89 = 462
- Agent 1's total valuation: 79 + 66 + 8 + 25 + 46 + 91 + 2 = 317
- Agent 2's total valuation: 57 + 19 + 6 + 33 + 10 + 84 + 22 = 231

Given these valuations, Agent 0 places the highest total value on the items, followed by Agent 1 and Agent 2.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0:** Prioritize high-value items for Agent 0 since they have the highest total valuation.
2. **Agent 1:** Allocate items to balance their relatively high value on few items.
3. **Agent 2:** Allocate remaining items, seeking to maximize their total satisfaction.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items 0 (70), 3 (88), 6 (89)
- **Agent 1**: Items 5 (91), 1 (66)
- **Agent 2**: Items 4 (10), 2 (6)

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and it aims to be as fair as possible given the agents' valuations.
