Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  12  81  75  68  81  26
1  40  61  37  57  65  58  28
2  11  29  13  56  35  95  65
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 12 81 75 68 81 26]
 [40 61 37 57 65 58 28]
 [11 29 13 56 35 95 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we want to aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle. 

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [81, 12, 81, 75, 68, 81, 26]
Agent 1: [40, 61, 37, 57, 65, 58, 28]
Agent 2: [11, 29, 13, 56, 35, 95, 65]
```

Let's approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Values items 0, 2, and 5 highly (81 each). To maximize their satisfaction, we can allocate items 0 and 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** Values item 1 the highest (61) and has a relatively high value for item 4 (65). We allocate items 1 and 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** Has the highest valuation for item 5 (95) and also values item 3 (56) and item 6 (65) relatively well. We allocate items 3, 5, and 6 to agent 2.

This allocation considers the highest preferences of each agent and aims to maintain balance in how much each agent values their received items.

Let's present the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation covers all 7 items and aims to reflect each agent's preferences as closely as possible given the constraints.
