Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93   0   5  85  33  26  55
1  94  86  28  50  64  31  12
2  62  67   3  27  10  66  82
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93  0  5 85 33 26 55]
 [94 86 28 50 64 31 12]
 [62 67  3 27 10 66 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received at least as much value as any other agent's allocation, based on their own valuation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: prefers item 0 the most (value 93), followed by item 3 (value 85).
- Agent 1: prefers item 0 the most (value 94), followed by item 1 (value 86).
- Agent 2: prefers item 6 the most (value 82), followed by item 5 (value 66).

A strategy for fair division could involve assigning the highest valued item to each agent first and then distributing the remaining items to minimize envy.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign each agent their highest valued item:
   - Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 93).
   - Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 86).
   - Agent 2 gets item 6 (value 82).

2. Distribute remaining items to balance overall utility:
   - Agent 0 can take item 3 (value 85) since it is still valuable to them and avoids envy.
   - Agent 1 can take item 4 (value 64).
   - Agent 2 can take items 5 and 2 (values 66 and 3 respectively).

This allocation tries to balance the values each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one high-valued item according to their preferences. The remaining items are distributed to optimize the satisfaction of each agent.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6, 5, 2]
}
```
