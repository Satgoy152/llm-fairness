Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  49  99   9  23  72  65
1  79  89  40  79  89  12  77
2  21   6  63  98  56  63  23
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value any other allocation. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items, we can proceed with the following steps:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 0, 2, and 5.
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 4.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most, followed by items 2 and 5.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items to maximize each agent's perceived value while trying to avoid envy.

3. **Allocation Plan:**
   - **Agent 0:** Assign items where agent 0 has significantly higher valuations compared to other agents.
   - **Agent 1:** Assign items where agent 1 has the highest valuation.
   - **Agent 2:** Allocate items that are less valued by other agents but relatively valued by agent 2.

4. **Implementation:**

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 2, 5
  - Item 0: Highly valued by agent 0 (76) and less by others.
  - Item 2: Highest value for agent 0 (99).
  - Item 5: High value (72) for agent 0.

- **Agent 1:** Items 1, 3, 4
  - Item 1: Highest value for agent 1 (89).
  - Item 3: Equal high value for agent 1 and agent 2, but agent 1 has a higher overall value need.
  - Item 4: Highest value for agent 1 (89).

- **Agent 2:** Items 6
  - Item 6: Moderate value for agent 2 (23), but fits after other items have been allocated.

5. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [6]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while minimizing envy, given the constraints.
