Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  36  39  38  95  50  17
1   3  33  73  46  16  67   4
2  76   7  77   8  91  74  13
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and integer allocations, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's analyze the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets an equitable share based on their preferences.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [30, 36, 39, 38, 95, 50, 17]
Agent 1: [3, 33, 73, 46, 16, 67, 4]
Agent 2: [76, 7, 77, 8, 91, 74, 13]
```

We will aim to allocate the items by considering the highest valued items for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 4 the most (value 95), followed by item 5 (value 50).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 2 the most (value 73), followed by item 5 (value 67).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 4 the most (value 91), followed by item 2 (value 77) and item 5 (value 74).

We can allocate items to maximize each agent’s satisfaction while ensuring that the allocations are envy-free and each agent receives at least one item. Here’s a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0, 1, and 6. These are not the highest valued items for the other agents, helping minimize envy.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 2 and 3. Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 4 and 5. These are among the highest valued items for Agent 2.

This allocation is not perfect, but it balances the high-value items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
