Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  11  13  20   2  23  45
1  44  36  84  73  42  69   6
2  45  35  84  45  67  88   2
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6 11 13 20  2 23 45]
 [44 36 84 73 42 69  6]
 [45 35 84 45 67 88  2]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation minimizes envy and respects each agent's valuation as much as possible. Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: `[6, 11, 13, 20, 2, 23, 45]`.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: `[44, 36, 84, 73, 42, 69, 6]`.
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: `[45, 35, 84, 45, 67, 88, 2]`.

We will allocate the items by considering the highest value each agent assigns to the items and ensuring that the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation is item 6 with a value of 45.
   - Next highest is item 5 with a value of 23.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is item 2 with a value of 84.
   - Next highest is item 3 with a value of 73.
   - Additional item is 1 with a value of 36.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is item 5 with a value of 88.
   - Next highest is item 4 with a value of 67.
   - Additional item is 0 with a value of 45.

Considering the above valuations and to minimize envy, we aim to allocate the items as follows:

### Allocation

- **Agent 0**: Items `[6]`
- **Agent 1**: Items `[2, 3, 1]`
- **Agent 2**: Items `[5, 4, 0]`

This allocation attempts to give each agent items that they value the most while distributing the items in a way that maintains balance among the agents.

### JSON Representation of the Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 3, 1],
    "2": [5, 4, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents while trying to respect their preferences and minimize envy.
