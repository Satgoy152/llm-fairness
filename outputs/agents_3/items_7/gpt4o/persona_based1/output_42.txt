Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  91  38  51  72  58  67
1  86   2  76  28  17  49  48
2  40  89  43  35  47  73  81
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items among the agents, we seek an allocation that minimizes envy. A common approach is to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, while considering the overall fairness.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the items by each agentâ€™s valuation**: Each agent has different valuations for the items, and we need to consider these to maximize individual satisfaction.

2. **Initial allocation based on highest valuations**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1.
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0.
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 6.

3. **Allocate remaining items by maximizing total valuation**:
   - After allocating the first choice to each agent, we allocate the remaining items to maximize the overall valuations for each agent while maintaining fairness.

4. **Adjust so each agent gets a fair share**:
   - We need to ensure that each agent ends up with a roughly equal total valuation of items.

Considering these steps, the fair allocation would be:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items that maximize their total value while leaving sufficient value for other agents. Items 1 and 5 maximize Agent 0's total value.
- **Agent 1**: After assigning item 0, allocate item 2 to maximize agent 1's valuation.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items that maximize their total value. Items 6, 3, and 4 maximize Agent 2's valuation.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints of integer allocations while considering the agents' valuation priorities and ensuring a fair distribution of total value.
