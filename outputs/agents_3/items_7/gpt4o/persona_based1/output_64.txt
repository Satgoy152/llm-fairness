Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  81  68  42  85  23  95
1  66  72  74  10  82  42  21
2  81  15  85   1  40  80  18
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 81 68 42 85 23 95]
 [66 72 74 10 82 42 21]
 [81 15 85  1 40 80 18]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation where envy-freeness is considered, we need to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations. We'll use a heuristic method to allocate items by considering the highest valuations first and then adjusting to maintain an approximate balance.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [94, 81, 68, 42, 85, 23, 95]
- Agent 1: [66, 72, 74, 10, 82, 42, 21]
- Agent 2: [81, 15, 85, 1, 40, 80, 18]

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 6:** Agent 0 values it highest at 95. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 2:** Agent 2 values it highest at 85. Allocate to Agent 2.
3. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it highest at 94. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 85, but since Agent 0 already has two items, consider Agent 1 who values it at 82. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 5:** Agent 2 values it highest at 80. Allocate to Agent 2.
6. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 81, but since Agent 0 already has two items, consider Agent 1 who values it at 72. Allocate to Agent 1.
7. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it highest at 42, but since Agent 0 already has two items, consider Agent 2 who has fewer items. Allocate to Agent 2.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3, 5

The allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
