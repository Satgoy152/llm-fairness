Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  86  55  59   5  12  48
1  45   6  69  89  94  46  51
2  47  12  83  92  26   8  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent feels they receive a fair share according to their own valuations. One approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Here's one possible allocation that attempts to balance the valuations:

1. **Agent 0 Allocation:**
   - Consider giving Agent 0 some of the items they value relatively highly to maximize their satisfaction.
   - Allocate items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1 Allocation:**
   - Give Agent 1 items they value highly, avoiding those already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Allocate items 3, 4, and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2 Allocation:**
   - Agent 2 will receive the remaining item.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

Now, let's confirm the allocations provide reasonable satisfaction for each agent based on their preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Values for items 0, 1, 2 are 61, 86, 55, giving a total value of 202.
- **Agent 1**: Values for items 3, 4, 5 are 89, 94, 46, giving a total value of 229.
- **Agent 2**: Value for item 6 is 58.

This allocation aims to give each agent a set of items such that they do not envy the others based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
