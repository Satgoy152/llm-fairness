Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  41  87  87  78  62  88
1  34  63  76  41  91  42  78
2  94  56  50  21  59  94  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 41 87 87 78 62 88]
 [34 63 76 41 91 42 78]
 [94 56 50 21 59 94 95]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the three agents, we aim to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy among the agents. One common approach to do this is to maximize the sum of each agent's valuations for the items they receive, given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while considering fairness:

1. **Listing Valuations:**

   - Agent 0: [94, 41, 87, 87, 78, 62, 88]
   - Agent 1: [34, 63, 76, 41, 91, 42, 78]
   - Agent 2: [94, 56, 50, 21, 59, 94, 95]

2. **Allocation Strategy:**

   - Prioritize items to agents who value them the most.
   - Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.
   - Attempt to balance total valuation received across agents.

3. **Item Allocation:**

   - **Agent 0** receives items:
     - Item 0 (value 94 for Agent 0, highest for any agent)
     - Item 2 (value 87 for Agent 0, highest for any agent)
     - Item 4 (value 78 for Agent 0)

   - **Agent 1** receives items:
     - Item 1 (value 63 for Agent 1)
     - Item 3 (value 41 for Agent 1)

   - **Agent 2** receives items:
     - Item 5 (value 94 for Agent 2, highest for any agent)
     - Item 6 (value 95 for Agent 2, highest for any agent)

This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives and minimizes potential envy by assigning items to agents who value them most highly when possible.

4. **JSON Representation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their respective valuations, given the constraints, and all items are allocated.
