Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  62   5  79  86   6  13
1   2  65  47  56  26  45  72
2  47  97  15  67  89  62  88
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 62  5 79 86  6 13]
 [ 2 65 47 56 26 45 72]
 [47 97 15 67 89 62 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent values their own bundle at least as much as they value any other agent's bundle.

First, let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [96, 62, 5, 79, 86, 6, 13]
- Agent 1: [2, 65, 47, 56, 26, 45, 72]
- Agent 2: [47, 97, 15, 67, 89, 62, 88]

We'll distribute the items in a way that aims to reduce envy among agents:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0 (96) and 4 (86). These two items alone sum to 182, which is a significant amount of their total possible value.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 highly values item 6 (72) and item 1 (65). These two items alone sum to 137, which is a significant portion of their total possible value.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 highly values items 1 (97) and 4 (89). However, item 1 is already allocated to Agent 1, so we can consider other high-value items like 6 (88) and 3 (67).

Let's allocate the items according to these considerations:

- Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 6 and 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 2, 3, and 5 to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a set of items that maximizes their valuations based on the constraints and aims to minimize envy among them.
