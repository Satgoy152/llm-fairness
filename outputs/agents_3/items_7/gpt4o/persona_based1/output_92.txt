Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  86  90  81   7  30  90
1  22  80  13  99  11  75  57
2  47  89  30  37  53  31  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[88 86 90 81  7 30 90]
 [22 80 13 99 11 75 57]
 [47 89 30 37 53 31 94]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while trying to ensure envy-freeness, we need to assess the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to assign items such that agents are as satisfied as possible based on their own valuations.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [88, 86, 90, 81, 7, 30, 90]
- Agent 1 values: [22, 80, 13, 99, 11, 75, 57]
- Agent 2 values: [47, 89, 30, 37, 53, 31, 94]

We want to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total value from their assigned items.

First, identify the highest valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations on items: 0, 2, and 6.
- Agent 1 has high valuations on items: 3, 5.
- Agent 2 has high valuations on items: 1, 6.

A potential allocation strategy is to prioritize each agent's highest-valued items, attempting to balance total values as well as possible:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 88).
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 99).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value 89).
4. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 90).
5. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 75).
6. Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value 94).
7. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (value 53), since agent 2 has the least value currently.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 4, 6]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```
