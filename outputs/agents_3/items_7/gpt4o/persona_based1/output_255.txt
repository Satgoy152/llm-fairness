Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  76  95  28  45  54   9
1  11  80  74  94  36  92  26
2  29  51  76  44  92  83  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their own valuation.

First, let's summarize the valuations for clarity:

- Agent 0: [51, 76, 95, 28, 45, 54, 9]
- Agent 1: [11, 80, 74, 94, 36, 92, 26]
- Agent 2: [29, 51, 76, 44, 92, 83, 42]

To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation, we can use the strategy of maximizing the minimum satisfaction among the agents. One approach is to assign items based on each agent's highest remaining valuation, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0 gets item 2**: They value it the highest at 95.  
2. **Agent 1 gets item 3**: They value it the highest at 94.  
3. **Agent 2 gets item 4**: They value it the highest at 92.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

4. **Agent 1 gets item 5**: They value it highly at 92.
5. **Agent 0 gets item 1**: They value it at 76, which is the next highest available.
6. **Agent 2 gets item 6**: They value it at 42, which is reasonable given the remaining options.
7. **Agent 0 gets item 0**: They value it at 51, which is the next highest remaining for them.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, aiming to minimize envy. The distribution is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
