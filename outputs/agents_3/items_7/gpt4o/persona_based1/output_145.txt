Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  17  90  67  42  72  49
1  86  37  58  11  92  72  11
2  77  30  87  51  62  91  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to distribute them in a way where no agent feels that another agent received a more valuable set of items than their own.

The valuations given are:

- Agent 0: [27, 17, 90, 67, 42, 72, 49]
- Agent 1: [86, 37, 58, 11, 92, 72, 11]
- Agent 2: [77, 30, 87, 51, 62, 91, 70]

A typical approach would be to use a method like the "envy-free up to one item" (EF1) allocation, which ensures that any envy can be eliminated by removing one item from the envied agent's allocation.

Let's attempt to allocate items to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 highly (90), and item 5 (72).
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 (86), and item 4 (92) highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 (87), item 5 (91), and item 6 (70) highly.

An allocation that balances these considerations could be:

- Give Agent 0 items [2, 5]
- Give Agent 1 items [0, 4]
- Give Agent 2 items [1, 3, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they highly value while keeping the distribution fair. Let's check the total allocation to ensure all 7 items are distributed:

- Agent 0: [2, 5]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [1, 3, 6]

All items are allocated, and the distribution is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation tries to respect the agents' preferences while distributing the items as fairly as possible.
