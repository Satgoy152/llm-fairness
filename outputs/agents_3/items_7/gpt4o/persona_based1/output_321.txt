Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  66  94  31  31  68  17
1  99  62  70  14  14  72  51
2  93   8  71  53  84  56  40
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[11 66 94 31 31 68 17]
 [99 62 70 14 14 72 51]
 [93  8 71 53 84 56 40]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, which means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over that of any other agent, based on their valuations. One way to approach this is to try and maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation, ensuring no agent envies another.

Let's first look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [11, 66, 94, 31, 31, 68, 17]
- Agent 1: [99, 62, 70, 14, 14, 72, 51]
- Agent 2: [93, 8, 71, 53, 84, 56, 40]

### Step-by-step Allocation Process

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (94).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (99).
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most (84).

2. **Assign these items first to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 2.
   - Agent 1 gets item 0.
   - Agent 2 gets item 4.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Remaining items: [1, 3, 5, 6]
   - Consider each agent's second highest valuation for the remaining items:
     - Agent 0: Item 5 (68)
     - Agent 1: Item 5 (72)
     - Agent 2: Item 3 (53)

4. **Assign items based on the next highest preferences without creating envy:**
   - Agent 1 gets item 5 (their second highest remaining preference).
   - Agent 0 gets item 1 (their next highest preference among what's left).
   - Agent 2 gets item 3.

5. **Allocate the final item:**
   - Remaining item: 6
   - Consider who values item 6 the most:
     - Agent 0: 17
     - Agent 1: 51
     - Agent 2: 40
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the most, so assign it to them.

### Final Allocation

Now, let's summarize the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 5, 6],
    "2": [4, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their personal valuations, reducing the likelihood of envy.
