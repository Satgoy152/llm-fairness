Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  46  69  48   6  52  26
1  42  77  69  21  14  70  54
2   3  80  47  40  88  66  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a method that aims for envy-freeness and a fair division of the items. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, one potential way to allocate items is by maximizing the sum of their valuations for the items they receive.

Let's consider the following allocations based on maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive:

1. **Agent 0**: We look for items where Agent 0 has relatively high valuations compared to others. Items 0, 1, and 2 are good candidates since Agent 0 values them highly compared to other items.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1, but since Agent 0 is already taking that item, we look for other items. Items 5 and 6 are valuable for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has very high valuation for item 4 and item 6, but since item 6 is taken, item 4 and 3 can be given to maintain fairness.

After considering these valuations, an allocation that attempts to be fair and minimize envy could be:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 2]
- **Agent 1**: [5, 6]
- **Agent 2**: [1, 3, 4]

However, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Given this constraint, let's adjust to:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 2]
- **Agent 1**: [1, 5]
- **Agent 2**: [3, 4, 6]

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that considers their valuations, while also maintaining the requirement that all items are allocated.
