Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  27  24   5  14  74   9
1  71  22  16   4  55  63  73
2  65  40   6  34  44  47  89
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent is satisfied with their share based on their valuations. Given that there are 7 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive approximately 2-3 items.

We will use a simple algorithmic approach to achieve a fair division:

1. **Assign the Highest Valued Item**: Assign each agent the item they value the most, provided it hasn't been allocated yet.
2. **Balance Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items by attempting to balance total valuation among agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Step 1: Assign the Highest Valued Item

- **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 5 (value 74).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 0 (value 71).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 6 (value 89).

### Step 2: Balance Remaining Items

Items 1, 2, 3, and 4 are unallocated. We will distribute them to balance the overall valuation:

- **Agent 0**: Currently has item 5 (value 74).
- **Agent 1**: Currently has item 0 (value 71).
- **Agent 2**: Currently has item 6 (value 89).

Consider the remaining items and their values per agent:

- **Item 1**: Agent 0 (27), Agent 1 (22), Agent 2 (40)
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 (24), Agent 1 (16), Agent 2 (6)
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 (5), Agent 1 (4), Agent 2 (34)
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 (14), Agent 1 (55), Agent 2 (44)

Allocate based on maximizing each agent's total value:

- **Assign Item 1**: To Agent 2 (value 40)
- **Assign Item 2**: To Agent 0 (value 24)
- **Assign Item 3**: To Agent 2 (value 34)
- **Assign Item 4**: To Agent 1 (value 55)

### Final Allocation JSON

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [6, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their preferences. Each agent gets at least two items, and all items are allocated.
