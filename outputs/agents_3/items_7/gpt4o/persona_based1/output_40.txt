Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99   8  44  54  82  99  27
1  92  64   7  93  14  47  13
2  18  80  72  86  85  21  17
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy by considering the preferences of each agent. Let's use the method of maximizing the Nash welfare, which is a common approach in fair division problems. The Nash welfare is the product of the agents' utilities and seeks to balance the allocations by maximizing this product.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 0 (99) and item 5 (99). Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for item 3 (93) and item 1 (64). Assign these items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has a high valuation for item 4 (85) and item 2 (72). Assign these items to Agent 2.
4. **Remaining item (6)**: Agent 0 values it at 27, Agent 1 at 13, and Agent 2 at 17. Agent 0 has currently the least valuation from other items (198), so assign item 6 to Agent 0 to balance the allocation.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 5, 6]
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 1]
- **Agent 2**: Items [4, 2]

This allocation balances the overall distribution and takes into account the agents' preferences as much as possible.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```
