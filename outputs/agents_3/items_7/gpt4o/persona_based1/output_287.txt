Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  36  36  42   0  13  86
1  76  91  60  59  89  96  17
2  73  16  17   9  37  37  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy. Although achieving perfect envy-freeness with indivisible items is often challenging, we can attempt to create a balanced allocation. 

First, let's examine the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 74 + 36 + 36 + 42 + 0 + 13 + 86 = 287
- Agent 1: 76 + 91 + 60 + 59 + 89 + 96 + 17 = 488
- Agent 2: 73 + 16 + 17 + 9 + 37 + 37 + 74 = 263

The total valuations suggest that Agent 1 has the highest overall interest in the items, followed by Agent 0, and then Agent 2.

Next, let’s consider allocating items by prioritizing each agent's highest valued items to reduce potential envy:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for items 1 and 5. Therefore, we allocate items 1 and 5 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values item 6 the most, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 5, and 6. Next, let's allocate the remaining items:

4. **Item 4** is valued highest by Agent 1, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 2** is valued equally by Agents 0 and 1 but has slightly more value for Agent 1 considering the overall context, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
6. **Item 3** is valued highest by Agent 0, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

Let's review the allocations and ensure all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: 6, 3
- Agent 1: 1, 5, 4, 2
- Agent 2: 0

Now, let’s present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [1, 5, 4, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and the division attempts to minimize envy based on the agents' valuations.
