Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  77  28  71  36  59  70
1  93  51  36  60  59  44  18
2  37  21   8  23  61  60  40
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider an allocation that minimizes envy and provides a fair distribution based on their valuations. A common approach is to aim for an envy-free or proportional allocation, though achieving perfect envy-freeness with indivisible goods is often challenging. We will attempt to allocate items to maximize fairness and minimize envy.

Let's analyze the valuations and find a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 (77), 3 (71), and 6 (70).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0 (93), 3 (60), and 4 (59).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 4 (61), 5 (60), and 6 (40).

A possible allocation strategy is to assign items that maximize each agent's total valuation, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Given the constraints, we can proceed as follows:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 since it has the highest value for Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it has a relatively high value for Agent 1, and Agent 0 already has item 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 because it has the highest value for Agent 2.
- Continue assigning based on remaining high values and ensuring all items are distributed.

After considering these assignments, we can allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as it has a high value for Agent 2.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as it has a high value for Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, balancing the number of items each receives.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total perceived value while ensuring all items are distributed. The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair share of the items, and the allocation aims to minimize envy based on the given valuations.
