Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  46  19  92  34  93  30
1  51  81   7   5  30  63  64
2  22  44  12  81   4  41  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to allocate items such that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocations received by the other agents. This often involves balancing the total value each agent perceives from the items they receive.

Let's compute the total value each agent would assign to various allocations and find a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0's valuation:**
   - Highest valued items: 3 (92), 5 (93), 0 (90)
   - Total value if allocated these items = 275

2. **Agent 1's valuation:**
   - Highest valued items: 1 (81), 5 (63), 6 (64)
   - Total value if allocated these items = 208

3. **Agent 2's valuation:**
   - Highest valued items: 3 (81), 6 (55), 1 (44)
   - Total value if allocated these items = 180

To ensure fairness, it is often beneficial to give each agent their most valued items as much as possible, while ensuring all items are allocated and no agent has a significant envy over the other allocations.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 4, 5
  - Total value = 90 + 34 + 93 = 217
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 6
  - Total value = 81 + 64 = 145
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 3
  - Total value = 12 + 81 = 93

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they highly value while minimizing envy. Let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0** gets high total value and receives one of their top valued items.
- **Agent 1** gets the highest value item (1) and another high-value item (6).
- **Agent 2** receives item 3, which is their top valued item.

This allocation ensures all agents receive a fair portion of their perceived value.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly among the agents, considering their individual valuations.
