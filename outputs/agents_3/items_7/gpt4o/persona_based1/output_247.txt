Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  63  48  95  76  38  98
1   1  33  13  75  30  96  93
2  87  60  95  52  53  36  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[60 63 48 95 76 38 98]
 [ 1 33 13 75 30 96 93]
 [87 60 95 52 53 36 85]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that maximizes the satisfaction of all agents, ideally maintaining envy-freeness or minimizing envy as much as possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to finding such an allocation:

1. **Valuation Matrix**:
   - Agent 0: [60, 63, 48, 95, 76, 38, 98]
   - Agent 1: [1, 33, 13, 75, 30, 96, 93]
   - Agent 2: [87, 60, 95, 52, 53, 36, 85]

2. **Identify Highest Valued Items for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: Item 6 (98)
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (96)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (95)

3. **Assign Highest Valued Items**:
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 0
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2

4. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Remaining items: [0, 1, 3, 4]
   - Consider the second highest values for each agent:
     - Agent 0: Item 3 (95)
     - Agent 1: Item 6 (93) [already assigned]
     - Agent 2: Item 0 (87)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 to maximize their satisfaction.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Remaining items: [1, 4]

5. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - Consider the remaining valuations:
     - Agent 0: [1 (63), 4 (76)]
     - Agent 1: [1 (33), 4 (30)]
     - Agent 2: [1 (60), 4 (53)]
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (63 > 33 and 63 > 60 for Agents 1 and 2 respectively).
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (since 76 is the highest remaining valuation).

6. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [6, 3, 1, 4]
   - Agent 1: [5]
   - Agent 2: [2, 0]

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3, 1, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total value based on their preferences and to distribute items fairly given the constraints.
