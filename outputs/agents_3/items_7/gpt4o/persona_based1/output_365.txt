Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  81  17  52  60  86  81
1   9   5  22  49  83   4  91
2  20   7  10  53  76  74   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that aims for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items. The goal is to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations, and ideally, no agent should envy another's allocation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Preferences**: Examine the valuation table to understand each agent's preferences for the items.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Start by allocating items that are most valued by each agent, ensuring no overlaps initially.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: After the initial allocation, check if any agent envies another's allocation. If so, adjust the allocation to reduce or eliminate envy.

4. **Final Allocation**: Ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0's highest valued items are 0, 1, 5.
- Agent 1's highest valued items are 6, 4, 3.
- Agent 2's highest valued items are 4, 5, 3.

#### Allocation Process:

1. **Allocate high-value items**:
   - Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 88) and item 5 (value 86).
   - Agent 1 gets item 6 (value 91) and item 4 (value 83).
   - Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 53).

2. **Distribute remaining items considering secondary preferences**:
   - Item 1 and item 2 are lower-valued and can be distributed to balance the allocation:
     - Agent 0 can take item 1 (value 81, which is high for Agent 0).
     - Agent 2 can take item 2 (value 10, while not high, it balances their allocation).

This allocation should be fairly balanced given the valuations and aims to minimize envy by giving each agent items they highly value.

#### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
