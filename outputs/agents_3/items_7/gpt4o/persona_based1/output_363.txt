Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45   2  39  37  72  56   1
1  98  79  79  26  35  73  64
2  11   0   1  90  96   9  38
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents while minimizing envy, we will use the concept of maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive. We aim to assign items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is as high as possible.

Let's consider the following steps for allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:**
   - Determine which items have high valuations for each agent.
   - Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring no items are double-assigned.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate items primarily based on each agent's highest valuation to minimize potential envy.

3. **Adjustments:**
   - Ensure each agent receives at least one item, adjusting allocations where necessary.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the above principles:

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0:**
  - High-value items: Item 4 (72), Item 5 (56), Item 0 (45)
  - Assign: Item 0, Item 5

- **Agent 1:**
  - High-value items: Item 0 (98), Item 1 (79), Item 2 (79), Item 5 (73)
  - Assign: Item 1, Item 2

- **Agent 2:**
  - High-value items: Item 3 (90), Item 4 (96)
  - Assign: Item 3, Item 4

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated:

- Unallocated Items: Item 6 (since Items 0-5 are allocated)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 as it maximizes their total valuation while maintaining fairness (Agent 1 has a relatively more balanced valuation across unallocated items).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly while maintaining envy-freeness to a reasonable extent given the constraints. It also ensures that all 7 items are allocated among the agents.
