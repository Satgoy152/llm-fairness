Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  31  88  46  10  72  12
1  19  11  92  91   0  72  15
2  35  41  17   4  50  95  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share, given their individual valuations. In situations like this, the goal is often to maximize each agent's satisfaction and minimize envy between agents.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values items highly at 2 (88), 5 (72), and 3 (46).
- Agent 1 values items highly at 2 (92), 3 (91), and 5 (72).
- Agent 2 values items highly at 5 (95), 4 (50), and 1 (41).

A potential approach to allocate items could involve ensuring each agent receives items that they value highly, while also balancing the total value across all agents.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 as it has the highest value for Agent 0. Then allocate item 1 (second highest value).
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 3 and item 0. These are among the highest values for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 5, item 4, and item 6. Item 5 is the highest value for Agent 2, and item 4 is the next highest.

**Allocation Result:**

- Agent 0 receives items [2, 1].
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 0].
- Agent 2 receives items [5, 4, 6].

This allocation ensures each agent gets their highly valued items, and the allocation is fair in terms of distributing the total value each agent receives.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [5, 4, 6]
