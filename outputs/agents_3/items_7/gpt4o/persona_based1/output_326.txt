Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  33  75  84  71  45  56
1  36  22  65  77  72  53  98
2  81  94   0  85  59   6  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 94  0 85 59  6 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming at envy-freeness, we can follow a strategy such as the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) allocation or another method that seeks to minimize envy among the agents.

Given the valuations provided, let's analyze possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values highest for item 3 (84) and item 2 (75).
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values highest for item 6 (98) and item 4 (72).
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values highest for item 1 (94) and item 0 (81).

To minimize envy and ensure fair division, we can allocate items based on the highest valuations for each agent, taking into consideration the overall balance and ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [3, 5]
  - Item 3 has a high value for Agent 0, and item 5 is less contested.
  
- **Agent 1**: Items [6, 4]
  - Item 6 is highly valued by Agent 1, and item 4 is next highest available.

- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 0, 2]
  - Items 1 and 0 have high values for Agent 2, and item 2 is taken to balance the allocation.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items they value highly, helping to minimize envy.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [1, 0, 2]
}
```
