Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  96  17  25  72  87  71
1  41  82  73  86  69  51  10
2  33  88  94  64  36  44  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly. Given the constraints and preferences, we must ensure that all 7 items are distributed among the agents. 

Let's analyze the agents' preferences and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High values: Item 1 (96), Item 5 (87), Item 4 (72)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - High values: Item 3 (86), Item 2 (73), Item 1 (82)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High values: Item 2 (94), Item 1 (88), Item 3 (64)

The goal is to allocate items such that the agents receive items they value highly, and the allocation is envy-free as much as possible.

Let's attempt the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (96), Item 5 (87)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (86), Item 4 (69)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (94), Item 0 (33), Item 6 (63)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 0, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly while distributing all 7 items among the agents.
