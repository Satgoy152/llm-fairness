Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48   8  40  18  85  29   4
1  65  73  98  65  15  81  79
2  70  95   2  47  54  65  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 95  2 47 54 65 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we must ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair compared to others. Here's one possible allocation using a heuristic approach to achieve fairness:

1. **Agent 0:** Prefers item 4 the most (value 85), then item 0 (value 48).
2. **Agent 1:** Prefers item 2 the most (value 98), then item 1 (value 73).
3. **Agent 2:** Prefers item 1 the most (value 95), then item 5 (value 65).

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Assign item 4 (85) and item 0 (48).
- **Agent 1:** Assign item 2 (98) and item 1 (73).
- **Agent 2:** Assign item 5 (65), item 3 (47), and item 6 (22).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some of their highly valued items, aiming to minimize envy among the agents. Now let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [5, 3, 6]
}
```
