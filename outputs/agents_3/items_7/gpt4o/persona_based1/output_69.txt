Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  25  12  75  40  96  77
1  32  38   9  83  98   4  60
2  85  90  99  32  79  54  43
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [85 90 99 32 79 54 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. One approach to achieve this is to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, known as the maximin allocation. Another approach is to use the method of "round-robin" where agents take turns picking their most preferred available item.

Let's consider using the round-robin method to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 selects item 5 (value 96).
2. Agent 1 selects item 4 (value 98).
3. Agent 2 selects item 2 (value 99).
4. Agent 0 selects item 6 (value 77).
5. Agent 1 selects item 3 (value 83).
6. Agent 2 selects item 1 (value 90).
7. Agent 0 selects item 0 (value 55).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets to pick their most preferred item available during their turn, which helps in minimizing envy.

Now, I will provide the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```
