Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  49  73  60  55  74  88
1  22  72  49  67  79  81  68
2  95  75  18  70  12  36  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what they perceive others have received.

Given the valuations of each agent for the items, we aim for a fair division such that each agent is content with their share. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**'s highest valued items are: 6, 5, 2.
2. **Agent 1**'s highest valued items are: 5, 4, 3.
3. **Agent 2**'s highest valued items are: 0, 1, 3.

We will prioritize allocations based on their highest valuations while ensuring no agent feels envious of another's allocation. This type of problem can be approached with various algorithms, such as the envy-free division method, but given the small scale, a heuristic approach can work as well.

Here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items [6, 2] because item 6 is their highest value, and item 2 is also highly valued.
- **Agent 1** gets items [5, 3] as these are among their highest valued items.
- **Agent 2** gets items [0, 1, 4] as these items include their highest valued item, 0, and no other agent has a high valuation for item 4.

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
