Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  34  41   1  15  35  81
1  25  53   3  59  95   3  23
2  89  81  23  38  42  19  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-freeness, we aim to allocate items to agents in a way that minimizes envy, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent values their allocation. We must consider the individual valuations of items by each agent and distribute them such that the total value is somewhat balanced among the agents.

Given the valuations:

| Item/Agent | 0  | 1  | 2  |
|------------|----|----|----|
| 0          | 11 | 25 | 89 |
| 1          | 34 | 53 | 81 |
| 2          | 41 | 3  | 23 |
| 3          | 1  | 59 | 38 |
| 4          | 15 | 95 | 42 |
| 5          | 35 | 3  | 19 |
| 6          | 81 | 23 | 51 |

A potential allocation strategy is to assign:

- Agent 0: Items with high relative valuation in comparison to other agents.
- Agent 1: Items that maximize their total valuation.
- Agent 2: Items with high valuation, ensuring they do not envy other allocations.

Considering these points, an allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Item 6 (valued at 81)
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 4 (valued at 59 and 95, respectively)
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 2, 5 (valued at 89, 81, 23, and 19, respectively)

This allocation aims to balance high-value items among the agents while considering individual preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 5]
}
```
