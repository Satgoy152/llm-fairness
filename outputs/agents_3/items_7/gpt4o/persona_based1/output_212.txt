Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  86  75  98  33  63  19
1  91  43  50  21  24  70  91
2  78  72  19  57  74  54  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[23 86 75 98 33 63 19]
 [91 43 50 21 24 70 91]
 [78 72 19 57 74 54 50]]
Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, one approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent using a method like the "Adjusted Winner" or "Round Robin" approach. Given the valuations, we can attempt to balance the allocations so that each agent perceives they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

### Valuations Table:
```
Agent 0: [23, 86, 75, 98, 33, 63, 19]
Agent 1: [91, 43, 50, 21, 24, 70, 91]
Agent 2: [78, 72, 19, 57, 74, 54, 50]
```

### Steps for Allocation:
1. **Identify Highest Valuation Per Item:** Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, if possible.
2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets At Least One Item:** Make necessary adjustments to ensure all agents receive items.
3. **Maintain Envy-Freeness:** Try to balance the total valuation each agent receives to minimize envy.

### Allocation Process:
1. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it highest at 91.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it highest at 86.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it highest at 75.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it highest at 98.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 2 values it highest at 74.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 1 values it highest at 70.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 1 values it highest at 91.

After this initial allocation, Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 3; Agent 1 receives items 0, 5, and 6; and Agent 2 receives item 4.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Items [1, 2, 3]
- **Agent 1:** Items [0, 5, 6]
- **Agent 2:** Items [4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some portion of the items, and each agent is assigned items they highly value.

### JSON Representation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 5, 6],
    "2": [4]
}
```
