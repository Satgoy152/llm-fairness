Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  38  75  97  13  41  72
1  94  65  40  30  24  20  70
2  94  38   2   7  82  19  35
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's minimum value of allocated items, which is a common approach in fair division.

Let's evaluate different allocations to achieve a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: [36, 38, 75, 97, 13, 41, 72]
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: [94, 65, 40, 30, 24, 20, 70]
3. **Agent 2's Valuations**: [94, 38, 2, 7, 82, 19, 35]

Let's try to allocate the items in a way that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3. 
- Agent 1 highly values item 0.
- Agent 2 highly values item 4.

We can start by allocating these highly valued items to each agent and then allocate remaining items to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 0
- **Agent 2**: Item 4

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 2, 5, 6):

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (high value for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (decent value for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (moderate value for Agent 2).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (decent value for Agent 2).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Items [3, 2]
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 1]
- **Agent 2**: Items [4, 5, 6]

Now, presenting the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to provide a fair distribution of items by considering individual valuations and minimizing potential envy.
