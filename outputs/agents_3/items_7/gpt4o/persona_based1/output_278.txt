Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  42  24  70  25  97  33
1  26  42  87  60  12  71  20
2  57  37  68   6  67  28  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 42 87 60 12 71 20]
 [57 37 68  6 67 28 63]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a fair manner, we will use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [11, 42, 24, 70, 25, 97, 33]
- Agent 1's valuations: [26, 42, 87, 60, 12, 71, 20]
- Agent 2's valuations: [57, 37, 68, 6, 67, 28, 63]

To achieve envy-freeness, we want to ensure that each agent gets items that maximize their utility while minimizing potential envy.

A possible envy-free allocation could be:

1. Assign Agent 0 the items with the highest values according to their personal valuation.
2. Repeat for Agent 1 and Agent 2, ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

- Agent 0 highly values item 5 (value 97) and item 3 (value 70). We assign these to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 2 (value 87) and item 5 (value 71). Since item 5 is already taken, we assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 0 (value 57), item 4 (value 67), and item 6 (value 63). We assign items 0, 4, and 6 to Agent 2.
- Agent 1 also values item 1 (value 42), which Agent 0 also values equally, but since Agent 0 has already received high-value items, we assign item 1 to Agent 1.

After allocating these items, we can check if any items are left unallocated and ensure everyone has at least one item.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4, 6

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 4, 6]
}
```
