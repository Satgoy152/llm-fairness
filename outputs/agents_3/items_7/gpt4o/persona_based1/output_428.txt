Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  70  90  49   6  81  37
1  48  68   1  32  75  54  44
2  48  19  53  66  92  41  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent while distributing the items.

Let's first analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 highly values items 4 and 1.
- Agent 2 highly values items 4 and 3.

One possible fair allocation can be made by considering each agent's highest valued items while ensuring no overlap:

1. **Agent 0**: Give items that have high value to Agent 0 and low value to others. Items 0, 2, and 5 fit this criterion as they are highly valued by Agent 0 compared to others.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items that maximize Agent 1's value and minimize envy. Items 4 and 1 are highly valued by Agent 1 and less so by others.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate the remaining items, ensuring Agent 2 is satisfied. Items 3 and 6 are reasonably valued by Agent 2 and have lower combined value for other agents.

This allocation strategy considers each agent's preferences and attempts to minimize envy. Let's present the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly and minimizes the potential for envy among the agents.
