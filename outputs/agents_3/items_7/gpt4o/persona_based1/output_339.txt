Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93   9   7  19  77  64  40
1  21  22  20  33  95  57  48
2   0   7  55   6  56  51  53
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [21 22 20 33 95 57 48]
 [ 0  7 55  6 56 51 53]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to minimize the envy each agent might feel towards others by maximizing their own valuations of the assigned items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 93
  - Item 1: 9
  - Item 2: 7
  - Item 3: 19
  - Item 4: 77
  - Item 5: 64
  - Item 6: 40

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 21
  - Item 1: 22
  - Item 2: 20
  - Item 3: 33
  - Item 4: 95
  - Item 5: 57
  - Item 6: 48

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 0
  - Item 1: 7
  - Item 2: 55
  - Item 3: 6
  - Item 4: 56
  - Item 5: 51
  - Item 6: 53

To achieve a fair division, we will allocate the items to maximize the total satisfaction of each agent:

1. **Agent 0** highly values:
   - Item 0 (93)
   - Item 4 (77)
   - Item 5 (64)
   - Item 6 (40)

2. **Agent 1** highly values:
   - Item 4 (95)
   - Item 3 (33)
   - Item 5 (57)
   - Item 6 (48)

3. **Agent 2** highly values:
   - Item 2 (55)
   - Item 4 (56)
   - Item 5 (51)
   - Item 6 (53)

Based on this analysis, we can create an allocation that attempts to maximize satisfaction and fairness:

- **Agent 0** gets items that they value the most and are less valued by others:
  - Items: 0, 1

- **Agent 1** gets items they value highly:
  - Items: 4, 3

- **Agent 2** gets items they value highly:
  - Items: 2, 5, 6

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the items according to their preferences.

The JSON allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
