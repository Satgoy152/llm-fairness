Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  48  93  27  89  50   2
1  44  93  62  36  31  39  46
2  60   0  49  56  21  91  17
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to aim for envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items that another agent has over their own bundle, given their personal valuations.

Let's approach this by iteratively assigning items to agents based on their highest relative valuations, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share without envy.

Here are the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [80, 48, 93, 27, 89, 50, 2]
- Agent 1: [44, 93, 62, 36, 31, 39, 46]
- Agent 2: [60, 0, 49, 56, 21, 91, 17]

To find a fair allocation, we can use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on their highest relative valuations, ensuring that each agent receives a fair number of items.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 2**, valued highest by Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**, valued highest by Agent 1.
3. **Item 5**, valued highest by Agent 2.
4. **Item 4**, valued highest by Agent 0.
5. **Item 0**, valued highest by Agent 2 (after initial allocations).
6. **Item 3**, valued highest by Agent 2 (after initial allocations).
7. **Item 6**, valued highest by Agent 1 (after initial allocations).

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 0, 3]

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5, 0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, aiming for an envy-free distribution.
