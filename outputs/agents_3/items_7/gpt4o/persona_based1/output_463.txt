Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  57  56  22  17  12  37
1  74   1   6  91  64  36  67
2  78  41  64  90  83  22  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 0 57 56 22 17 12 37]
 [74  1  6 91 64 36 67]
 [78 41 64 90 83 22 25]]
Output:
To allocate the items in a fair manner among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items so that envy is minimized. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent would prefer to have someone else's allocation instead of their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [0, 57, 56, 22, 17, 12, 37]
- Agent 1: [74, 1, 6, 91, 64, 36, 67]
- Agent 2: [78, 41, 64, 90, 83, 22, 25]

Let's analyze and allocate each item:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (0), Agent 1 (74), Agent 2 (78).
   - Highest value: Agent 2. Allocate to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (57), Agent 1 (1), Agent 2 (41).
   - Highest value: Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (56), Agent 1 (6), Agent 2 (64).
   - Highest value: Agent 2. Allocate to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (22), Agent 1 (91), Agent 2 (90).
   - Highest value: Agent 1. Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:** 
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (17), Agent 1 (64), Agent 2 (83).
   - Highest value: Agent 2. Allocate to Agent 2.

6. **Item 5:** 
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (12), Agent 1 (36), Agent 2 (22).
   - Highest value: Agent 1. Allocate to Agent 1.

7. **Item 6:** 
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (37), Agent 1 (67), Agent 2 (25).
   - Highest value: Agent 1. Allocate to Agent 1.

Allocate items based on the approach above, ensuring every item is assigned:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent receives items they value highly, thus minimizing potential envy.
