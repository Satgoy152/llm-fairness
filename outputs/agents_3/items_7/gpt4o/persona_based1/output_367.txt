Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  41  44  78  20  57  66
1  88  90  65  73  63   9  43
2  26  34  12  82  79  64  80
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where no agent prefers the bundle of items that another agent receives over their own. Given the valuations, we can attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while keeping the distribution as fair as possible.

To tackle this, let's consider the following approach:

1. **Greedy Allocation**: Start by allocating the item with the highest individual valuation to the respective agent. Then, proceed to allocate the next highest unallocated item to the agent who values it the most, and so on.

2. **Reallocation for Fairness**: After the initial allocation using a greedy method, check for any envy situations (where one agent prefers another agent's allocation more than their own). If any exist, try to swap items between agents to reduce envy.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Assign the highest valued items**:
   - Item 1 (value 90) goes to Agent 1.
   - Item 0 (value 88) goes to Agent 1.
   - Item 4 (value 79) goes to Agent 2.
   - Item 6 (value 80) goes to Agent 2.
   - Item 3 (value 78) goes to Agent 0.
   - Item 5 (value 64) goes to Agent 2.
   - Item 2 (value 65) goes to Agent 1.

2. **Review and Adjust for Fairness**:
   - Agent 1 receives items [0, 1, 2].
   - Agent 2 receives items [4, 5, 6].
   - Agent 0 receives item [3].

This distribution is initially based on high valuations and checks for envy situations. If any adjustments are needed for fairness, it would involve checking if agents have an envy-free allocation. However, this allocation seems fairly balanced based on the valuations.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by distributing the highest-valued items to the agents who value them the most while ensuring each agent receives some items.
