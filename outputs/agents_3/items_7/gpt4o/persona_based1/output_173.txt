Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  88  29  81  12  13  26
1  32   9  17  74  74   1  56
2  19  26  81  66  41  10  81
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. To do this, we can utilize a method called the "Adjusted Winner Procedure" or similar heuristic methods that aim for fairness by considering each agent's valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3.
- Agent 1 values items 3 and 4 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 2 and 6 highly.

A possible fair allocation can be crafted by ensuring each agent receives items they highly value and attempting to balance the total value each agent receives.

**Proposed Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High value items: 0, 1, 3
   - Allocate items: 0, 1

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High value items: 3, 4
   - Allocate items: 3, 4

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High value items: 2, 6
   - Allocate items: 2, 6, 5

This distribution attempts to give each agent a portion of high-value items according to their preferences. Let's ensure all items are allocated and check for envy-freeness:

- **Agent 0** receives items 0 and 1, which are highly valued for them.
- **Agent 1** receives items 3 and 4, which are highly valued for them.
- **Agent 2** receives items 2, 5, and 6. Items 2 and 6 are highly valued for them.

This allocation is designed to minimize envy by giving each agent some of their most valued items while ensuring that all items are distributed. Let's formalize it in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
