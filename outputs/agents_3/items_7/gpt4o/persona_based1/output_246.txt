Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  89  11  81  18   2  73
1  74  71  70  87  67  59  67
2  66   3  93  67  65  72  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[72 89 11 81 18  2 73]
 [74 71 70 87 67 59 67]
 [66  3 93 67 65 72 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. One common approach to fair division is to use the "Adjusted Winner" or "Envy-Free" method, but given the discrete nature of the problem (integer items), we can consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction by comparing their valuations.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [72, 89, 11, 81, 18, 2, 73]
- Agent 1 values: [74, 71, 70, 87, 67, 59, 67]
- Agent 2 values: [66, 3, 93, 67, 65, 72, 62]

For each item, we'll allocate it to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

1. **Item 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 1 (74)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0 (89)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 2 (93)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 1 (87)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 1 (67)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

6. **Item 5**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 2 (72)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

7. **Item 6**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0 (73)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [1, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 2: [2, 5]

Each agent receives at least one item, and we have allocated all 7 items.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
