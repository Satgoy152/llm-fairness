Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  64  22  64  39  56  25
1   8  16  34  28  36  67  81
2  24  66  36  22  24  76  88
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[37 64 22 64 39 56 25]

 [24 66 36 22 24 76 88]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and try to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value fairly. One common approach is to try to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

The valuations for each agent can be summarized as follows:

- **Agent 0's valuations:** [37, 64, 22, 64, 39, 56, 25]
- **Agent 1's valuations:** [8, 16, 34, 28, 36, 67, 81]
- **Agent 2's valuations:** [24, 66, 36, 22, 24, 76, 88]

We need to allocate a total of 7 items among the 3 agents. Let's attempt to do this in a way that balances the total valuation each agent receives.

One potential allocation strategy is:

1. **Allocate high-value items based on individual preferences.**
2. **Ensure each agent gets a reasonable total value of items.**

Following this strategy, here is one allocation that tries to balance the total valuation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 3]. Valuations: 37 + 64 = 101
- **Agent 1:** Items [5, 6]. Valuations: 67 + 81 = 148
- **Agent 2:** Items [1, 2, 4]. Valuations: 66 + 36 + 24 = 126

This allocation ensures that:

- Each agent gets an integer number of items.
- The total number of items allocated is 7.
- The overall valuation is reasonably balanced among the agents.

Finally, the allocations can be presented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
