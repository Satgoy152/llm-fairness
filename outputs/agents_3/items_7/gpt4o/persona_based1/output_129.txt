Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  25  34  36   4  85  74
1  87  30  29  16  39  36  11
2  72  46  10  52  45  95  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[87 25 34 36  4 85 74]
 [87 30 29 16 39 36 11]
 [72 46 10 52 45 95 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering each agent's valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy (i.e., each agent feels they received a fair share based on their own valuations). One common approach in fair division is to use the "Envy-Free" allocation method, where each agent should feel that their allocated bundle is at least as good as any other agent's bundle according to their own valuations.

Given the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0: [87, 25, 34, 36, 4, 85, 74]
- Agent 1: [87, 30, 29, 16, 39, 36, 11]
- Agent 2: [72, 46, 10, 52, 45, 95, 94]

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 5, and 6. We can attempt to give them these high-value items to maximize their utility.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 very highly as well, but since Agent 0 already has it, we compensate by giving them items with higher relative value like 4.
3. **Agent 2** values items 5 and 6 highly, but since these are already allocated to Agent 0, we give them items like 3 and 1 which they value relatively more compared to other agents.

Let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 5] - total value for Agent 0 is 87 + 85 = 172
- **Agent 1**: Items [4] - total value for Agent 1 is 39
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 2, 3, 6] - total value for Agent 2 is 46 + 10 + 52 + 94 = 202

This allocation tries to ensure each agent feels that their bundle is fair considering their valuations.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
