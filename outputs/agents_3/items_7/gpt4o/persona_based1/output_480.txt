Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  67  99  10  72   4  37
1  56  65  84  52   9  74  88
2   5  75  14  82  66  45  35
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[75 67 99 10 72  4 37]
 [56 65 84 52  9 74 88]
 [ 5 75 14 82 66 45 35]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while also trying to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Observations**:  
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (99).
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (88).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (75).

2. **Assign the Highest Valued Item**:  
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items left are 0, 3, 4, and 5.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0: After assigning item 2, Agent 0 has a high preference for item 0 (75). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: After assigning item 6, Agent 1 has a high preference for item 5 (74). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2: After assigning item 1, Agent 2 has a high preference for item 3 (82). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Finally, item 4 can be allocated to Agent 0, as it maximizes their remaining value.

5. **Valuations Check**:
   - Agent 0: [2, 0, 4] with values [99, 75, 72].
   - Agent 1: [6, 5] with values [88, 74].
   - Agent 2: [1, 3] with values [75, 82].

This proposed allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items considering their valuations, and aims to minimize envy by giving each agent their highest valued available items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 4],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
