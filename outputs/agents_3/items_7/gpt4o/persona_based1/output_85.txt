Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  13  94  24  86  17  97
1  29  28  41  81   5  53  12
2  10  13  59  31  89   9  16
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that tries to balance the allocation so that each agent has an allocation that maximizes their utility and tries to minimize envy. Here, we'll use a simple approach:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Allocate items in a way that aims to equalize the total value each agent receives, based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 23 + 13 + 94 + 24 + 86 + 17 + 97 = 354
- Agent 1: 29 + 28 + 41 + 81 + 5 + 53 + 12 = 249
- Agent 2: 10 + 13 + 59 + 31 + 89 + 9 + 16 = 227

Now, we'll allocate the items, aiming to balance the values each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item for agent 0 is item 6 (97).
   - Next highest value item for agent 0 is item 2 (94).
   - Next highest is item 4 (86).
   - Next is item 3 (24).
   
   Allocate items 6, 2, 4, and 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item for agent 1 is item 3 (81).
   - Next highest is item 5 (53).
   - Next is item 0 (29).
   
   Allocate items 3, 5, and 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item for agent 2 is item 4 (89).
   - Next highest is item 2 (59).
   - Next is item 3 (31).
   
   Allocate items 4, 2, and 3 to agent 2.

After reviewing the allocations, ensure no item is allocated to more than one agent, and each agent receives their highest-valued items to maximize perceived fairness.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [6, 2, 4]
- Agent 1: [5, 0]
- Agent 2: [3, 1]

This allocation results in each agent receiving a fair share of their valued items while ensuring all items are allocated. Presenting this in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2, 4],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable share of their most valued items, while allowing for a fair distribution among all agents.
