Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  66  79  90  37  88  79
1  28  31  54  17  84  52  61
2  86  85  48   3  36  42  88
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to use principles of fair division, particularly focusing on maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that no agent feels envy towards another's allocation. Below is a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the valuations for each agent:**

   - Agent 0: [25, 66, 79, 90, 37, 88, 79]
   - Agent 1: [28, 31, 54, 17, 84, 52, 61]
   - Agent 2: [86, 85, 48, 3, 36, 42, 88]

2. **Allocate the highest valued items to each agent based on their preferences:**

   - Agent 0's highest value item is item 3 (value 90).
   - Agent 1's highest value item is item 4 (value 84).
   - Agent 2's highest value item is item 0 (value 86).

3. **Continue allocating the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives at least two items (since there are 7 items and 3 agents, some may need more than two):**

   - For Agent 0, after item 3, the next highest valued items are 5 (value 88) and 6 (value 79).
   - For Agent 1, after item 4, the next highest valued items are 6 (value 61) and 5 (value 52).
   - For Agent 2, after item 0, the next highest valued items are 6 (value 88) and 1 (value 85).

4. **Resolve conflicts where multiple agents value the same item highly:**

   - Item 6: Valued by Agent 0 (79), Agent 1 (61), Agent 2 (88). Allocate to Agent 2.
   - Item 5: Valued by Agent 0 (88), Agent 1 (52), Agent 2 (42). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Valued by Agent 0 (66), Agent 1 (31), Agent 2 (85). Allocate to Agent 2.
   - Remaining item 2 (not highly valued by any agent): Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Final allocation:**

   - Agent 0: Items 3, 5, 2
   - Agent 1: Item 4
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 6, 1

By following this allocation, each agent receives items that they value highly, and we aim to minimize envy by considering each agent's preferences.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 6, 1]
}
```
