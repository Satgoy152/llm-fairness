Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  51  35  73  15  18  18
1  97  20  64  12  48  97  65
2  31  75  34   1  76  44  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent believes they received the best possible share according to their own valuations. Given the data, we can try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's highest valued items are: Item 3 (73), Item 0 (54), Item 1 (51).
- Agent 1's highest valued items are: Item 0 (97), Item 5 (97), Item 6 (65).
- Agent 2's highest valued items are: Item 4 (76), Item 1 (75), Item 5 (44).

Considering these preferences, we can aim to allocate high-valued items to each agent while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation.

Here's a proposed allocation:

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 to maximize their high valuation.
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, which is their highest valued item.
3. Give Item 1 to Agent 2, as it's their second-highest valued item.
4. Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1, another high-value item for them.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2, their highest valued item.
6. Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1, as it adds significant value.
7. Finally, assign Item 2 to Agent 0 as itâ€™s the remaining item and somewhat valued by them.

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
