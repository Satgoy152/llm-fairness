Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  27  86  59  37  42  14
1  23  20  91  31  73  47  66
2  13  49  70  43  35  61  68
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the agents' total utility while aiming for envy-freeness. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to each item and attempt to maximize their satisfaction:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 90  
- Item 1: 27  
- Item 2: 86  
- Item 3: 59  
- Item 4: 37  
- Item 5: 42  
- Item 6: 14  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 23  
- Item 1: 20  
- Item 2: 91  
- Item 3: 31  
- Item 4: 73  
- Item 5: 47  
- Item 6: 66  

Agent 2's valuations:  
- Item 0: 13  
- Item 1: 49  
- Item 2: 70  
- Item 3: 43  
- Item 4: 35  
- Item 5: 61  
- Item 6: 68  

To achieve fairness, we'll allocate items based on the preference ranking indicated by their valuations:

1. **Assign high-value items to agents who value them the most:**
   - Item 0 is most valued by Agent 0.
   - Item 1 is most valued by Agent 2.
   - Item 2 is most valued by Agent 1.
   - Item 3 is most valued by Agent 0.
   - Item 4 is most valued by Agent 1.
   - Item 5 is most valued by Agent 2.
   - Item 6 is most valued by Agent 1.

2. **Proceed by assigning items to maximize individual agent value while ensuring each agent gets at least some items:**

    - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0
    - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2
    - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1
    - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0
    - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1
    - Assign Item 5 to Agent 2
    - Assign Item 6 to Agent 1

This allocation should be checked to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 4, and 6.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 5.

This allocation attempts to maximize the total utility for each agent while considering their preferences.
