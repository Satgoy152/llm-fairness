Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  16   4  64  27  11  91
1  35  18  52  10  62  42  75
2  12   6  92  20  98  54  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, ensuring that each agent is at least as happy with their allocation as they would be with any other agent's allocation. This can be challenging, but a good starting point is to maximize each agent's valuation of their allocated items.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to construct an envy-free allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**  
   - High: Item 6 (91), Item 3 (64), Item 0 (63)
   - Medium: Item 4 (27)
   - Low: Item 1 (16), Item 2 (4), Item 5 (11)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**  
   - High: Item 6 (75), Item 4 (62), Item 2 (52)
   - Medium: Item 5 (42), Item 0 (35)
   - Low: Item 1 (18), Item 3 (10)

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:**  
   - High: Item 4 (98), Item 2 (92), Item 6 (76)
   - Medium: Item 5 (54)
   - Low: Item 0 (12), Item 3 (20), Item 1 (6)

To allocate fairly, we need to ensure that:

- Each agent gets at least one of their high-value items.
- The total number of items allocated is exactly 7.
- We aim to minimize envy among the agents.

Let's attempt an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Give them Item 0 (63) and Item 3 (64)
- **Agent 1**: Give them Item 2 (52) and Item 6 (75)
- **Agent 2**: Give them Item 4 (98), Item 5 (54), and Item 1 (6)

Now, let's verify:

- **Agent 0**: Total valuation = 63 + 64 = 127
- **Agent 1**: Total valuation = 52 + 75 = 127
- **Agent 2**: Total valuation = 98 + 54 + 6 = 158

Each agent receives at least one high-value item according to their preferences, and all items are allocated with an attempt to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [4, 5, 1]
}
```
