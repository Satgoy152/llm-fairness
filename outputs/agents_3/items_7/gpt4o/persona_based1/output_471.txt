Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  47  31  52  83  65  68
1  57   1  75  39   0  90  56
2  11  91  29  40  10  75  15
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[58 47 31 52 83 65 68]
 [57  1 75 39  0 90 56]
 [11 91 29 40 10 75 15]]
Output:
To allocate the items in a manner that is fair and as envy-free as possible, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. While achieving complete envy-freeness may not always be possible, we can attempt to allocate items to minimize envy while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest at 83, which is significantly higher than any other items. Therefore, let's allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has a very high valuation (90) for item 5, making it a good choice for them to receive that item.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest at 91, so it's prudent to allocate item 1 to them.

Now, we distribute the remaining items:

4. **Agent 0** can receive item 3, which they value at 52.
5. **Agent 1** can receive item 2, valued at 75.
6. **Agent 0** can receive item 0, valued at 58.
7. **Agent 2** can receive item 6, valued at 15.

This allocation attempts to respect the highest preferences and distribute other items fairly.

Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 3, 0],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [1, 6]
}
```
This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving a non-negative integer number of items, and attempts to minimize envy based on the given valuations.
