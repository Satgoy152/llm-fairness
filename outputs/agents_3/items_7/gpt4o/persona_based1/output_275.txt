Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  75  75  12  86  64  87
1  94  47  98  60  48  35  52
2  14  61  20  80  30  13  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[41 75 75 12 86 64 87]
 [94 47 98 60 48 35 52]
 [14 61 20 80 30 13 94]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent more than their own bundle.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: [41, 75, 75, 12, 86, 64, 87]
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: [94, 47, 98, 60, 48, 35, 52]
3. **Agent 2's Valuations**: [14, 61, 20, 80, 30, 13, 94]

A plausible approach is to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, trying to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items that maximize their total value.

Here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 4 (75 + 86 = 161)
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 2, 5 (94 + 98 + 35 = 227)
- **Agent 2**: Items 3, 6 (80 + 94 = 174)

This allocation respects the integer constraint and ensures that each agent receives items that are highly valued to them. The allocation might not be perfectly envy-free, but it attempts to distribute items in a way that maximizes each agent's total utility, considering their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a few highly valued items, balancing the total value among agents while ensuring all items are allocated.
