Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  60  44  84  95  76  87
1  75  16  92   9  72  12  26
2  33  87  85  66  10  76  33
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [75 16 92  9 72 12 26]
 [33 87 85 66 10 76 33]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent values their own set of items at least as much as they value the set of items allocated to any other agent. Given the valuations, we can use a fair division method to achieve this.

Let's first evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items and then attempt to allocate items such that each agent feels they received a fair share.

### Agent Valuations:

- **Agent 0:** Total valuation = 16 + 60 + 44 + 84 + 95 + 76 + 87 = 462
- **Agent 1:** Total valuation = 75 + 16 + 92 + 9 + 72 + 12 + 26 = 302
- **Agent 2:** Total valuation = 33 + 87 + 85 + 66 + 10 + 76 + 33 = 390

### Allocation Strategy:

A simple strategy is to attempt to allocate the highest value items to each agent in a way that balances their total valuations as evenly as possible. Let's create an allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highly values items: 4 (95), 3 (84), 6 (87)
   - Allocate: [4, 6] (Total value = 95 + 87 = 182)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highly values items: 2 (92), 0 (75)
   - Allocate: [2, 0] (Total value = 92 + 75 = 167)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highly values items: 1 (87), 5 (76), 3 (66)
   - Allocate: [1, 5, 3] (Total value = 87 + 76 + 66 = 229)

### Check and Adjust:

- **Agent 0:** Items [4, 6] -> Total value = 182
- **Agent 1:** Items [2, 0] -> Total value = 167
- **Agent 2:** Items [1, 5, 3] -> Total value = 229

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [1, 5, 3]
}
```

With this allocation, each agent receives a set of items that they value highly, aiming for an envy-free division.
