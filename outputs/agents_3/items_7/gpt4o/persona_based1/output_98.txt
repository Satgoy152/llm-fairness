Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  43  96  21  59  59  48
1  20  46  15  80  32  48  96
2  35  39  88  45  24  74   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that may be envy-free or at least minimizes envy while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Envy-freeness is a condition where no agent prefers another agent's bundle of items over their own. Given the complexity of this problem, especially without using fractional items, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible, but we can strive for a fair allocation.

Let's examine the valuations and allocate items in a way that tries to balance the total value each agent receives. We'll use a heuristic approach to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation.

### Valuations Matrix:
```
Agent\Item:   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agent 0:     58  43  96  21  59  59  48
Agent 1:     20  46  15  80  32  48  96
Agent 2:     35  39  88  45  24  74   4
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 2 and 4.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 3 and 6.
3. **Agent 2** values items 2 and 5.

We'll try to allocate items to agents by giving priority to their highest-valued items while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

### Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 2. (Total value: 58 + 96 = 154)
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 3 and 6. (Total value: 80 + 96 = 176)
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 1, 4, and 5. (Total value: 39 + 24 + 74 = 137)

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent, considering their preferences and trying to minimize envy. Note that perfect envy-freeness might not be achieved, but this allocation provides a reasonable distribution based on the given valuations.
