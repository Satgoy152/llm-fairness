Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  78   3  95  64  31  50
1  94  87  95   6  34  20  48
2  17  83  63  49   6  47  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation based on their valuations. One common approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent would prefer another's allocation over their own. However, given the discrete nature of items and the need for integer allocations, achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging. Instead, we will strive for a fair division that is as balanced as possible given the constraints.

Let's analyze each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to allocate them to minimize envy and achieve a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 values item 3 highly (95) and item 1 (78). 
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (94) and item 2 (95).
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly (83) and item 2 (63).

One possible fair allocation, attempting to balance the high-value items among agents while ensuring each gets a fair share, could be:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0. This is their highest-valued item.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1. This is their highest-valued item.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 2. This is their highest-valued item.
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 1. This is another high-valued item for them.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0. This gives them another item to balance the allocation.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2. This helps balance the number of items.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 2. This ensures Agent 2 gets three items, matching the distribution.

These allocations attempt to respect the high valuations each agent has for certain items while distributing the items as evenly as possible. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```
