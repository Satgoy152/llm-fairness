Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  35  78  81  10  19  92
1  55  10  97  68  87  12   9
2  26  31  31  22  91  80  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[11 35 78 81 10 19 92]
 [55 10 97 68 87 12  9]
 [26 31 31 22 91 80 94]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach to achieve this is to use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations each agent receives, while keeping the allocation envy-free if possible.

Let's examine the valuations table:

```
       0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agent
0     11  35  78  81  10  19  92
1     55  10  97  68  87  12   9
2     26  31  31  22  91  80  94
```

We will aim to allocate the items in a way that tries to maximize the value for each agent while considering the constraints of fair division. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highly values items 6 (92) and 3 (81).
- Agent 1 highly values items 2 (97) and 4 (87).
- Agent 2 highly values items 6 (94) and 4 (91), but since we are already giving item 4 to Agent 1, we need to consider other options.

Let's try the following allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (55), as it is the highest value for an unallocated item for Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (31), as it is a decent value for Agent 2 given the constraints.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (97), which is optimal.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (81), which is the highest for Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (87), which is optimal.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (80), which is the highest for Agent 2.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (92), which is the highest for Agent 0.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a high value from their allocated items, and no agent envies another based on the distribution of items.
