Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  55  35  32  26  31  99
1  84  63  29  45  75   9  12
2  70  78   8  27  36  92  27
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78 55 35 32 26 31 99]
 [84 63 29 45 75  9 12]
 [70 78  8 27 36 92 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**:  
   - **Agent 0**: 78 + 55 + 35 + 32 + 26 + 31 + 99 = 356  
   - **Agent 1**: 84 + 63 + 29 + 45 + 75 + 9 + 12 = 317  
   - **Agent 2**: 70 + 78 + 8 + 27 + 36 + 92 + 27 = 338  

2. **Initial Item Assignment Based on Highest Value**:
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

   - **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 84 (highest).
   - **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it at 78 (highest).
   - **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 35 (highest).
   - **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 45 (highest).
   - **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 75 (highest).
   - **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it at 92 (highest).
   - **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 99 (highest).

3. **Identify Imbalances and Adjust**:
   - Ensure that no agent is without items and the distribution is roughly balanced.
   - Check if any adjustments can be made to reduce potential envy.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - To balance the allocations slightly more, consider the following adjustments:
     - Switch item 3 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 has a slightly lower total valuation).
     - Switch item 4 from Agent 1 to Agent 2 (to balance Agent 1 and Agent 2).

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - After adjustments, this allocation attempts to balance the agentsâ€™ total valuations from their perspective.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair portion of the items according to their own valuations, while also ensuring that each agent receives a non-zero number of items.
