Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  30  37  79   4  69  45
1  60   4   5  84  68  17  10
2  71  50  35  37  30  90  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 30 37 79  4 69 45]
 [60  4  5 84 68 17 10]
 [71 50 35 37 30 90 42]]
Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we need to allocate the items to the agents in a way that ideally maximizes each agent's total valuation while aiming for fairness, such as minimizing envy. Since we have 3 agents and 7 items, each agent should ideally receive about 2-3 items.

Here's a step-by-step approach for allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuations:** Start by identifying which items have high valuations for each agent, focusing on items where an agent's valuation is significantly higher than others'.
   
2. **Assign Items with Clear Preference:** If an agent has a unique highest valuation for an item, allocate that item to them.

3. **Balance Remaining Items:** For items with similar valuations across agents, distribute them to balance the overall allocation, considering that each agent should ideally receive 2 or 3 items.

Now, let's examine the table and make allocations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0 has the highest valuation by Agent 0 (value 95).
  - Item 3 also has a high valuation by Agent 0 (value 79).

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 4 has the highest valuation by Agent 1 (value 68).
  - Item 3 is also highly valued by Agent 1 but we'll allocate it to Agent 0 due to Agent 0's even higher preference.
  - Item 2 has the highest valuation by Agent 2, so we'll avoid giving it to Agent 1.

- **Agent 2:**
  - Item 5 has the highest valuation by Agent 2 (value 90).
  - Item 2 is preferred by Agent 2 over others (value 35).
  
- **Allocate Remaining Items:**
  - Item 1 is not highly valued by any agent, but Agent 2 has a relatively higher valuation compared to others.
  - Item 6 also shows a moderate preference by Agent 0, though its valuation is close to Agent 2.

Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 6
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, 5

This allocation utilizes each agent's preferences and distributes the items relatively evenly. The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
