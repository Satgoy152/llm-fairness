Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  62  90  62  98  38  40
1  27  90  42  81  33  46  11
2  31  29  91  10  31  52  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 1 62 90 62 98 38 40]
 [27 90 42 81 33 46 11]
 [31 29 91 10 31 52 90]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent believes they have received the best possible bundle of items according to their valuations. Here is one way to allocate the items considering the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuation for item 4 (98) and item 2 (90), but agent 2 also values item 2 highly (91).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 as it is the highest value across all agents for this item.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuation for item 1 (90).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 as it is the highest value across all agents for this item.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuation for item 6 (90).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2 as it is the highest value across all agents for this item.

Now, distribute the remaining items (0, 2, 3, 5) considering remaining valuations:

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 2 values it at 91. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 since they have the highest valuation.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 81, which is the highest valuation for this item. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 52, which is the highest valuation for this item. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
   - Item 0: Assign to Agent 1 since they have not received as high valued items as others comparatively.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 0, Item 1, Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 2, Item 5, Item 6

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
