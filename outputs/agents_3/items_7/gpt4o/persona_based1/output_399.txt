Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  79  45   1  59  17  25
1  34  56  17  26  93  93  31
2  13  99  56   4   2  98   9
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 79 45  1 59 17 25]
 [34 56 17 26 93 93 31]
 [13 99 56  4  2 98  9]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to one item" (EF1) principle, which ensures that no agent envies another agent's allocation more than by one item.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [25, 79, 45, 1, 59, 17, 25]
- Agent 1: [34, 56, 17, 26, 93, 93, 31]
- Agent 2: [13, 99, 56, 4, 2, 98, 9]

We will try to allocate the items in a way that keeps the distribution as fair as possible.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Find High Valuations:**
   - Look for items that each agent values highly and try to allocate those items to them.
   - For instance, Agent 2 values item 1 highly (99), so item 1 should ideally be allocated to Agent 2.

2. **Balancing Allocations:**
   - Ensure that the sum of valuations for each agent is balanced.
   - Distribute remaining items to agents to balance their total valuation.

3. **Check for Fairness:**
   - Verify that the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.
   - Ensure each agent's allocation does not cause significant envy.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** [0, 2]
  - Valuation: 25 + 45 = 70
- **Agent 1:** [4, 5]
  - Valuation: 93 + 93 = 186
- **Agent 2:** [1, 3, 6]
  - Valuation: 99 + 4 + 9 = 112

### Verify:

- Total items: 7 (0 to 6)
- Each agent has an integer number of items.
- All items are allocated.

This allocation is designed to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3, 6]
}
