Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  58  22  91  10  46  60
1  82  89  40   2  32  57  39
2  70  78  37  35  51  26  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly and ensure envy-freeness, we can use a strategy that considers the agents' valuations for the items while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. A common approach is to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, which often involves iterative allocations based on preferences.

Letâ€™s examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (91).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 (89) and 0 (82).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 6 (75) and 1 (78).

Given these preferences, we will try to allocate items to maximize fairness and minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they value highly.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Assign high-value items to agents:**
   - Give item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Give item 1 to Agent 2 (high value for Agent 2).
   - Give item 0 to Agent 1 (high value for Agent 1).

2. **Assign remaining items considering next highest valuations:**
   - Consider items 2, 4, 5, and 6.
   - Agent 0: Has received item 3, additional high-value items are 5 and 6.
   - Agent 1: Has item 0, additional high-value items are 5 and 6.
   - Agent 2: Has item 1, additional high-value items are 6 and 0.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (next highest value after item 1).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest value after item 0).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it balances the allocation.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations, aiming for envy-freeness and fairness in distribution.
