Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  18  31  32  78  71   9
1  46  54  21  82  32  81  45
2  47  95  52   6  43  25  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the envy-freeness and fair division principles. One simple approach to achieve this is using the "Maximum Weighted Matching" in a bipartite graph, where one set of vertices represents agents and the other represents items. The edges have weights equal to the agent's valuation of the item.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Construct the graph** where agents are on one side and items on the other. The weight of the edge between an agent and an item is the agent's valuation of that item.

2. **Find the maximum weighted matching** in the bipartite graph. This will help in maximizing the overall satisfaction (valuation) for the agents.

3. **Assign items based on the matching**, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's compute the allocation:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [26, 18, 31, 32, 78, 71, 9]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [46, 54, 21, 82, 32, 81, 45]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [47, 95, 52, 6, 43, 25, 26]

To maximize overall satisfaction, we will prioritize assigning items to agents who value them the most:

1. Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 2 (95).
2. Item 3 is highly valued by Agent 1 (82).
3. Item 4 is highly valued by Agent 0 (78).
4. Item 5 is highly valued by Agent 1 (81).
5. Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 1 (46).
6. Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 0 (31).
7. Item 6 is valued equally by Agent 1 and Agent 2 (45 and 26, respectively), but Agent 1 has been given more high-value items already, so it should go to Agent 2.

Following these priorities, an allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 6

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [1, 6]
}
```
