Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  47  62  90  18  76  66
1  27  66  59  72  42  83  99
2  71  22  56  25  63  51  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 47 62 90 18 76 66]
 [27 66 59 72 42 83 99]
 [71 22 56 25 63 51 78]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility, ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation. One approach is to use a computational method such as the envy-free algorithm or the maximin share criterion. Given the constraints of integer allocations and the need to allocate exactly 7 items, we can attempt a manual allocation based on the valuations provided.

### Agent Valuations:
- **Agent 0:** 99, 47, 62, 90, 18, 76, 66
- **Agent 1:** 27, 66, 59, 72, 42, 83, 99
- **Agent 2:** 71, 22, 56, 25, 63, 51, 78

To ensure envy-freeness, we want to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 3 (values: 99, 90)
- **Agent 1:** Items 5, 6 (values: 83, 99)
- **Agent 2:** Items 1, 2, 4 (values: 22, 56, 63)

### Evaluation:
- **Agent 0 Total Value:** 99 + 90 = 189
- **Agent 1 Total Value:** 83 + 99 = 182
- **Agent 2 Total Value:** 22 + 56 + 63 = 141

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, reducing the potential for envy. Although it's challenging to achieve perfect envy-freeness without a computational algorithm, this heuristic approach aims to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's perceived value of their allocation.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 3 agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
