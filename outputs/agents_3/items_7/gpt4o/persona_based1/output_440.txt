Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  71  23   1  80  71  22
1  53  68  17  97  33  23   2
2  39  72   3  64  17  75  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [39 72  3 64 17 75 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while attempting to maintain envy-freeness, we can use an algorithmic approach that considers the preferences of each agent. One simple method is to allocate items iteratively based on the highest marginal gain for each agent. 

First, let's summarize the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [25, 71, 23, 1, 80, 71, 22]
- Agent 1: [53, 68, 17, 97, 33, 23, 2]
- Agent 2: [39, 72, 3, 64, 17, 75, 90]

Next, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 4** has the highest valuation from Agent 0 (80). Agent 0 receives item 4.
2. **Item 3** has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (97). Agent 1 receives item 3.
3. **Item 6** has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (90). Agent 2 receives item 6.
4. **Item 5** has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (75). Agent 2 receives item 5.
5. **Item 1** has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (72). Agent 2 receives item 1.
6. **Item 0** has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (53). Agent 1 receives item 0.
7. **Item 2** goes to Agent 0 as it maximizes Agent 0's remaining value (23).

After this allocation, each agent has received an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. The allocation is made in such a way to balance the overall satisfaction of each agent given their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```
