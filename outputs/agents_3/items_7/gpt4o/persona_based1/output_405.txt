Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  55  67  70  93  72  14
1  31  10  86  94   9  76  66
2  27  18  92  67   1  66  73
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 10 86 94  9 76 66]
 [27 18 92 67  1 66 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, meaning each agent should feel they have received the best possible allocation given the choices.

A simple way to approach this problem is to use the "maximum envy-free" method where each agent receives the items that maximize their valuation without making others envious.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 37 + 55 + 67 + 70 + 93 + 72 + 14 = 408
- Agent 1: 31 + 10 + 86 + 94 + 9 + 76 + 66 = 372
- Agent 2: 27 + 18 + 92 + 67 + 1 + 66 + 73 = 344

Given these totals, we attempt to allocate the items while keeping each agent's preferences in mind to minimize envy.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items in order: Item 4 (93), Item 5 (72), Item 3 (70)
   - Allocate items 4, 5, and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items in order: Item 3 (94), Item 2 (86), Item 5 (76)
   - Item 3 is taken, so allocate items 2 and 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items in order: Item 2 (92), Item 6 (73), Item 3 (67)
   - Items 2 and 6 are taken, so allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 2.

Now let's ensure all items are allocated and no agent has more than 3 items:

- Agent 0: [3, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: [2, 6]
- Agent 2: [0, 1]

This allocation ensures all 7 items are distributed, and each agent receives a set of items maximizing their personal valuation without exceeding fairness constraints.

### Final Allocation in JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints and the preferences of the agents.
