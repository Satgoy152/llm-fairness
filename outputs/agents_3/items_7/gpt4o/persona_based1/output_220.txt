Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  94  61  49  75  17  21
1   6  17  38  14  39  13  96
2  40  28  87  74  31  77  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40 28 87 74 31 77 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll strive for an allocation that balances the total value each agent perceives from their assigned items.

Here is one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 highly values item 1 with a valuation of 94. To ensure they receive a fair share of value, we can allocate item 1 to them.
   - Next, we can allocate item 0, which they value at 48, and item 4, which they value at 75, ensuring they get significant value.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the highest at 96, so we allocate it to them.
   - We can also allocate item 2, valued at 38, and item 5, valued at 13, to ensure they receive a fair portion.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 highly values item 3 at 74 and item 5 at 77. Since item 5 is already allocated, we allocate item 3 to them.
   - Additionally, we allocate item 2, valued at 87, which is already allocated, so we will add item 6 to Agent 2 for a fair balance considering available options.

Thus, the allocation can be structured as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed, each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation attempts to minimize envy by considering the valuations provided.
