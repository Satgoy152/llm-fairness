Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  55  52  38  72   1  11
1  65  97  38   2  48  90  61
2  29  98  33  81  40   7  15
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to reduce envy. One possible approach is to consider each agent's total value for all items and try to balance these totals as much as possible, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

   - Agent 0: 54 + 55 + 52 + 38 + 72 + 1 + 11 = 283
   - Agent 1: 65 + 97 + 38 + 2 + 48 + 90 + 61 = 401
   - Agent 2: 29 + 98 + 33 + 81 + 40 + 7 + 15 = 303

2. The goal is to allocate items in a way that each agent's received value is as balanced as possible. We will proceed based on the highest individual valuations.

3. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring each item is allocated only once and every agent receives some items.

   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (97), so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most (72), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most (81), so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. Continue allocating remaining items based on the highest next available valuations:

   - Agent 1 values item 5 second highest (90), so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 0 second highest (54), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 (33) next highest, so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

5. Allocate the final item:

   - The only remaining item is item 6. Agent 1 values it at 61, which is higher than the other agents, so allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

6. This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed.
