Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  20  13  33  89  85  42
1  36  99  10  11  77  81  83
2  31  71  27  75  71   3  57
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

One approach to achieve a fair division is to use the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) solution, which balances the product of the utilities received by each agent. However, since we're working with discrete items and integer allocations, we can also use a method like "Round Robin" or "Greedy Allocation" by valuations.

Let's attempt to allocate the items using a heuristic approach that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation:

1. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Sort the items based on the total valuation from all agents.
   - Allocate items one-by-one to the agent who values the currently considered item the most, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share.

2. **Allocation:**

   - Item 4 (total value 237): Assign to Agent 0 (highest value: 89).
   - Item 1 (total value 190): Assign to Agent 1 (highest value: 99).
   - Item 5 (total value 169): Assign to Agent 0 (next highest value: 85).
   - Item 3 (total value 119): Assign to Agent 2 (highest value: 75).
   - Item 2 (total value 50): Assign to Agent 0 (highest value: 13).
   - Item 6 (total value 182): Assign to Agent 1 (next highest value: 83).
   - Item 0 (total value 74): Assign to Agent 2 (highest value: 31).

3. **Final Allocations:**

   - Agent 0 receives items: 4, 5, 2
   - Agent 1 receives items: 1, 6
   - Agent 2 receives items: 3, 0

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation aims to give each agent a balanced share based on their individual valuations, trying to minimize envy among them.
