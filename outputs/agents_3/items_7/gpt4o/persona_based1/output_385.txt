Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  49  33  93  73  80  83
1  50  45  12  96  59  36  63
2  41  18  95  58  72  78   9
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent gets an allocation such that they do not prefer someone else's allocation over their own. Given the valuations for each item, one approach is to maximize the minimum value each agent receives.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 3 (93), 6 (83), and 5 (80). We'll allocate these items to Agent 0 to maximize their utility.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values items 3 (96) and 0 (50). Since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can allocate items 4 (59) and 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values items 2 (95) and 5 (78). Since item 5 is allocated to Agent 0, we'll allocate items 2 and 1 to Agent 2.

Now let's check if this allocation meets the conditions:

- **Agent 0**: [3, 5, 6]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 4]
- **Agent 2**: [1, 2]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items, and the total number of allocated items is 7. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
