Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  12  27  90  62  76  64
1  42  96  28   4  76  38  75
2   2  67  53  19  46  40  57
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items received by another agent over their own.

To achieve this, we can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate the total value of all items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0: 18 + 12 + 27 + 90 + 62 + 76 + 64 = 349
   - Agent 1: 42 + 96 + 28 + 4 + 76 + 38 + 75 = 359
   - Agent 2: 2 + 67 + 53 + 19 + 46 + 40 + 57 = 284

2. **Determine a fair division of items**:
   - We should aim to distribute items such that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly relative to their total value.

3. **Allocate items based on agents' preferences**:
   - Start by allocating items that are most highly valued by each agent, ensuring that no agent envies another.

Here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (value 90), item 5 (value 76), and item 4 (value 62). Allocating these items to Agent 0 gives them a total value of 228.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (value 96) and item 6 (value 75). Allocating these items to Agent 1 gives them a total value of 171.
- **Agent 2** can be allocated items 0, 2, which they value at 2 and 53 respectively, and item 2, which has a value of 53 to them. This gives Agent 2 a total value of 108.

These allocations are made to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, minimizing envy as much as possible.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents and respects each agent's preferences to the best extent possible, given the constraints.
