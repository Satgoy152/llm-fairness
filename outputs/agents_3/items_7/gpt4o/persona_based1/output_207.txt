Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  70  54  35  42  28  64
1   3  91  93  50  31   0   1
2  79  64  26  79   5   0  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 70 54 35 42 28 64]
 [ 3 91 93 50 31  0  1]
 [79 64 26 79  5  0 42]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we can employ an envy-free approach where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, minimizing envy among them. We must ensure each agent gets an integer number of items with all 7 items allocated in total.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 95. 
   - Then item 6 at 64.
   - Next, item 1 at 70.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 93.
   - Then item 1 at 91.
   - Assign item 3 to balance the allocation.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 0 at 79, but it's already taken by Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 at 79, but it's taken by Agent 1.
   - Assign item 4, valued at 5.

Given this analysis, here's an allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 6]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 2: [4, 5]

Let's check this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 6, valued at 95 and 64.
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 2, and 3, valued at 91, 93, and 50.
- Agent 2 gets items 4 and 5, valued at 5 and 0.

This allocation assigns all items and attempts to minimize envy by assigning items based on high valuation for each agent.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
