Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  72   2  51  38  81  75
1  62  39  58  46  11  43   7
2  56   1  20  94  48  52  87
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own, based on their valuation of the items.

The goal is to assign the 7 items to the 3 agents (0, 1, and 2) in a manner that minimizes envy and fairly distributes the value based on individual preferences.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (81).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 (62) the most.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 (94) the highest.

2. **Initial allocation based on highest valuations:**
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate remaining items considering overall valuations:**
   - Consider the remaining items: 1, 2, 4, and 6.
   - Allocate items based on remaining preferences to minimize envy:

   - Agent 0: Already has item 5. Add item 1 (72) and item 6 (75), which are highly valued by Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Already has item 0. Add item 2 (58), which is highly valued by Agent 1.
   - Agent 2: Already has item 3. Add item 4 (48), which is the next best choice for Agent 2.

4. **Finalize the allocation ensuring all items are distributed:**

   Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1, 5, and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 4.

This distribution aims to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their individual valuations, and seeks to minimize envy among the agents.
