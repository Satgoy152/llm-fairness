Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  64  96  38  43  45  22
1  88  46  54  37  47  95  75
2  34  84  58  64  40  39  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation of the items among the three agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's perceived value of their allocation while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation. One way to proceed is to use a heuristic method like the adjusted winner procedure or the maximum marginal utility approach. Here, I'll attempt to allocate items by maximizing individual agent's valuations while ensuring that each agent receives approximately the same total value from their allocated items.

Let's begin by analyzing the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0 values: [91, 64, 96, 38, 43, 45, 22]
- Agent 1 values: [88, 46, 54, 37, 47, 95, 75]
- Agent 2 values: [34, 84, 58, 64, 40, 39, 19]

To allocate these items fairly, we should consider assigning items to agents such that the total perceived value is as equal as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Assign Item 2 (highest value for Agent 0) to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0: [96]
   - Agent 1: []
   - Agent 2: []

2. **Assign Item 5 (highest value for Agent 1) to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0: [96]
   - Agent 1: [95]
   - Agent 2: []

3. **Assign Item 1 (highest value for Agent 2) to Agent 2:**
   - Agent 0: [96]
   - Agent 1: [95]
   - Agent 2: [84]

4. **Assign Item 0 (next highest for Agent 0) to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0: [96, 91]
   - Agent 1: [95]
   - Agent 2: [84]

5. **Assign Item 6 (next highest for Agent 1) to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0: [96, 91]
   - Agent 1: [95, 75]
   - Agent 2: [84]

6. **Assign Item 3 (next highest for Agent 2) to Agent 2:**
   - Agent 0: [96, 91]
   - Agent 1: [95, 75]
   - Agent 2: [84, 64]

7. **Assign the remaining Item 4 to Agent 1 (since it maximizes value without causing significant envy):**
   - Agent 0: [96, 91]
   - Agent 1: [95, 75, 47]
   - Agent 2: [84, 64]

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value across agents while minimizing envy. Each agent has received a set of items that collectively maximizes their individual valuations to the extent possible under these constraints.
