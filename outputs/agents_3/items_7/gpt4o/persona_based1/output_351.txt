Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  80  45  58  87  62  56
1  81  32  53  11   1  12  43
2  71  31  54  44   4  87  47
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation and that no agent envies another's allocation. This is a classic problem in fair division theory, often referred to as the "envy-free" allocation problem.

One approach to achieve this is to use a method like the "Envy-Free Matching" or any suitable approximation, given that achieving perfect envy-freeness with indivisible items may not always be possible.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [2, 80, 45, 58, 87, 62, 56]
- Agent 1: [81, 32, 53, 11, 1, 12, 43]
- Agent 2: [71, 31, 54, 44, 4, 87, 47]

Let's attempt to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy while considering the sum of valuations for each agent.

### Allocation Process

1. **Allocate to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Allocate to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate to Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - For item 1, Agent 0 values it the most after item 4.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - For item 2, Agent 2 values it the most after item 5.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
   - For item 3, Agent 0 values it more than others.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - For item 6, Agent 2 values it more than others.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocations

The final allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: [1, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [2, 5, 6]

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valued items while ensuring all items are distributed.
