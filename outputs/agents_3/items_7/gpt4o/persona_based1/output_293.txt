Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  68   4  43  48  94  59
1  91  61  68  68   4  91  44
2  78   0  81  34  25  33  53
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[87 68  4 43 48 94 59]
 [91 61 68 68  4 91 44]
 [78  0 81 34 25 33 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent values their bundle of items as at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Given the valuations, our goal is to distribute the items so that the distribution is as fair as possible.

### Valuations Table
```
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agent 0: 87  68   4  43  48  94  59
Agent 1: 91  61  68  68   4  91  44
Agent 2: 78   0  81  34  25  33  53
```

### Analysis
The key is to ensure that each agent values their bundle highly, while minimizing potential envy. 

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 5.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 2 and 6.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values it highly (87) while Agent 1 values it slightly higher (91), but Agent 0's value for it is significant.
2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values it highly (68) and it is not valued by Agent 2.
3. **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1**: Both Agent 0 and Agent 1 value this item highly, but Agent 0 already received item 0 and 1, so Agent 1 receives item 5.
4. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values it the highest (81).
5. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values it highly (68).
6. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values it the most (48).
7. **Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values it the most (53).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences.

### Final Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their bundle while ensuring that all items are distributed.
