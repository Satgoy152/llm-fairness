Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  19  76  16  16  42  93
1  52  42  85  13  84  28  11
2  76  35  74  48  67  28  73
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [76 35 74 48 67 28 73]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to ensure that the distribution is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints of integer allocations. We will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations to find a fair distribution:

```
Valuations:
Agent 0: [95, 19, 76, 16, 16, 42, 93]
Agent 1: [52, 42, 85, 13, 84, 28, 11]
Agent 2: [76, 35, 74, 48, 67, 28, 73]
```

First, let's identify the highest-valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 0 (95) and item 6 (93) the most.
- Agent 1 values item 2 (85) and item 4 (84) the most.
- Agent 2 values item 0 (76) and item 4 (67) the most.

An ideal initial allocation might allocate each agent their most valued item if possible, then proceed to allocate other items to balance the total valuation across agents. Let's attempt to do this while avoiding envy as much as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Allocate high-value items to preferred agents:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 0 (95).
   - Agent 1 gets item 2 (85).
   - Agent 2 gets item 4 (67).

Now, we have allocated 3 items, and each agent has one of their top-valued items.

2. **Allocate remaining items to balance values:**
   - Remaining items: 1, 3, 5, 6.
   - Agent 0 values item 6 highly (93), so assign item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 highly (but it's already allocated), so next is item 1 (42), assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 has item 4, so allocate item 3 (48) to Agent 2 as it's the next highest value.
   - The remaining item 5 (28) can be assigned to Agent 0 to balance the allocation.

### Final Allocation:
After balancing, we have allocated all 7 items. Let's ensure each agent gets the best possible outcome based on their preferences.

Hereâ€™s the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize total valuation for each agent and minimize potential envy, given the constraints of integer assignments.
