Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  70  67  33   6  62  99
1  20  22  14  66   3  25  37
2  30  90  28   5  67  19  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of every item and try to maximize fairness by minimizing envy. A common approach to achieve this is to use the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued available item until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 6 (99), so they take item 6.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (66), so they take item 3.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the most (90), so they take item 1.

Now, each agent has one item:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [1]

Continue the allocation:

4. **Agent 0** now values item 0 the most (53), so they take item 0.
5. **Agent 1** now values item 5 the most (25), so they take item 5.
6. **Agent 2** now values item 4 the most (67), so they take item 4.

Continuing the allocation:

7. The remaining item is 2. It goes to **Agent 0**, who values it at 67.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: [6, 0, 2]
- Agent 1: [3, 5]
- Agent 2: [1, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
