Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  60  66  40  76  36  10
1   2  61  82  17  54  22  90
2  69  85  45  15  17  80  38
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocated bundle of items over their own, given their valuations.

To find such an allocation, I will use a heuristic approach that tries to balance the total value each agent receives, based on their own valuations, while ensuring each agent's envy is minimized.

Let's calculate a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (76), Item 2 (66), Item 1 (60)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (90), Item 2 (82), Item 1 (61)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (85), Item 0 (69), Item 5 (80)

Now, I'll allocate the items based on the above preferences while ensuring that each agent has at least one highly valued item and that the total value is somewhat balanced:

- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).

Next, distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1).
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 (second highest value for Agent 2).
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2 (third highest value for Agent 2).
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (remaining item).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4 (value: 40 + 76 = 116)
- Agent 1: Items 2, 6 (value: 82 + 90 = 172)
- Agent 2: Items 1, 0, 5 (value: 85 + 69 + 80 = 234)

The allocation is not perfectly envy-free but tries to distribute items based on preferences, considering the constraints. Let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 0, 5]
}
```
