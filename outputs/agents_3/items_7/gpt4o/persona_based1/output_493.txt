Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  46  61  41  69  48  51
1  61  99  34  91  22  39  52
2  97  92  82  40  58  45  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 99 34 91 22 39 52]
 [97 92 82 40 58 45 95]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a manner that aims to be fair and potentially envy-free, we can use a method that considers the valuations of each item by each agent. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that prioritizes assigning items to the agent who values them the most while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 97.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 61.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 69.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 48.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

Now we have the following allocations:

- Agent 0: [2, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: [1, 3]
- Agent 2: [0, 6]

This allocation respects the valuations provided and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 6]
}
```
