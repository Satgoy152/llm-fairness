Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  14  32   8  52  74  14
1  67  20  98  62  79  70  39
2  37  73  15  87   2  53  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [67 20 98 62 79 70 39]
 [37 73 15 87  2 53 63]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we must consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives. A common approach to achieve envy-freeness in such problems is to use the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or other fair division algorithms. However, given the discrete nature of the problem (items cannot be split), we will use a heuristic method to approximate a fair allocation. 

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and find a way to balance these totals across agents.
2. Attempt to distribute items such that the sum of values each agent receives is as close as possible to the other agents' sums, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: [42, 14, 32, 8, 52, 74, 14]
- Agent 1: [67, 20, 98, 62, 79, 70, 39]
- Agent 2: [37, 73, 15, 87, 2, 53, 63]

### Total Valuations:
- Agent 0: 236
- Agent 1: 435
- Agent 2: 330

### Allocation:
- Agent 0: We aim to give Agent 0 items with higher personal valuation.
- Agent 1: Similarly, target items with highest valuation for Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Allocate items that maximize Agent 2's valuation within reason.

Based on the approach above, one possible allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5 (Total Value = 42 + 74 = 116)
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3 (Total Value = 98 + 62 = 160)
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4, 6 (Total Value = 73 + 2 + 63 = 138)

This allocation attempts to balance the values among agents as much as possible considering their individual valuations.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to approximate fairness based on the given valuations.
