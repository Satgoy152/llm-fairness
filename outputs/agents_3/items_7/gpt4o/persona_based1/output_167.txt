Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  59  62  44  93  25  42
1  57  87   1  69  82  86  31
2  40  20  71  77   9  42  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[24 59 62 44 93 25 42]
 [57 87  1 69 82 86 31]
 [40 20 71 77  9 42 14]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their valuations. One common method to achieve this is by maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their own valuations.

Let's analyze the table and find a suitable allocation:

```
    Items
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  59  62  44  93  25  42
1  57  87   1  69  82  86  31
2  40  20  71  77   9  42  14
```

### Steps to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - The highest valuation for Agent 0 is for item 4 (93).
   - Next highest valuations are for items 2 (62) and 1 (59).
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - The highest valuation for Agent 1 is for item 1 (87).
   - Next highest valuations are for items 0 (57) and 4 (82).
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - The highest valuation for Agent 2 is for item 2 (71).
   - Next highest valuations are for items 3 (77) and 5 (42).

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 as it is their highest valuation.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 as it is their highest valuation.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 as it is their highest valuation.

Now, considering remaining items and to balance total values:

- **Agent 0:** Assign item 3 (44) and item 6 (42) to Agent 0 to maximize their remaining value.
- **Agent 1:** Assign item 0 (57) to Agent 1 to maximize their remaining value.
- **Agent 2:** Assign item 5 (42) to Agent 2 to maximize their remaining value.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 3, 4, and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 5.

This allocation considers both maximizing individual agent values and distributing items fairly.

### JSON Format Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
