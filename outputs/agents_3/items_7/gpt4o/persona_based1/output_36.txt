Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  97  97  19  62  96   4
1  86  26  72  30  53   9  17
2  18  12  67  30   0   2   8
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the problem constraints, let's find a fair distribution of the items.

### Initial Observations:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 5.
- **Agent 1** values item 0 significantly but has moderate values for other items.
- **Agent 2** has a relatively high valuation for item 2 but low for others.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** should receive items they value highly, like items 1 and 2, to minimize envy.
2. **Agent 1** should start with item 0, which they value highly.
3. **Agent 2** should receive item 6, as it has the highest value among the remaining items for this agent.

### Remaining Items:

- Items 3, 4, and 5 need to be distributed.
- **Agent 0** values item 5 highly, so they should receive it.
- **Agent 1** can be allocated item 4, which has a moderate value for them.
- **Agent 2** can be assigned item 3, which has the same value as for agent 1, but agent 1 already has a high-value item (item 0).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance each agent's preferences and minimize potential envy.
