Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  72  55  27  55  67  89
1   4  72  31  30  55  78  42
2  61  89  12  39  34  93  20
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should consider the preferences of each agent for each item. We aim to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations and no agent envies another's allocation.

Here are the steps to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Valuations**: Each agent has different valuations for each item. These valuations are given, and we need to use them to make the allocations.

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation**: Start by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. This is a common approach to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly, which can help in achieving envy-freeness.

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness**: After initial allocations, check if any agent envies another. Adjust the allocation if necessary to reduce envy.

4. **Finalize Allocation**: Ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent has been considered.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on this strategy:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Values item 6 the most (value of 89), followed by item 1 (value of 72), and item 0 (value of 64).
  
- **Agent 1**: 
  - Values item 5 the most (value of 78), followed by item 1 (value of 72), and item 4 (value of 55).

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Values item 5 the most (value of 93), followed by item 1 (value of 89), and item 0 (value of 61).

**Allocation Decision**:
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (tied for highest but Agent 1 needs a high-value item).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation for Agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation for Agent 1).
- Assign item 2 and item 3 to Agent 2 (remaining items).

This allocation aims to give each agent at least one of their highly valued items, maintaining a balance and avoiding envy.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
