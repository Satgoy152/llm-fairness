Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  29  87   3  31  98  87
1  73  33  64  18  48  30  24
2  14  32   5  85  67  60  27
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent has for each item. An envy-free allocation implies that each agent does not prefer the bundle of another agent over their own.

To achieve this, we can use the "max-min" criterion, where we aim to maximize the minimum utility each agent receives, thus ensuring a fair distribution.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0 valuations:
- Items: [41, 29, 87, 3, 31, 98, 87]

Agent 1 valuations:
- Items: [73, 33, 64, 18, 48, 30, 24]

Agent 2 valuations:
- Items: [14, 32, 5, 85, 67, 60, 27]

We aim to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign the item with the highest valuation for each agent where possible, ensuring no conflicts. To resolve conflicts, we can look at the second highest valuation and adjust allocations.

2. Ensure each agent is allocated at least one item by considering their next highest preferences.

A possible allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items 5 and 2, valued at 98 and 87 respectively. This gives them the highest total value based on their top preferences.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 4, valued at 73 and 48 respectively. This respects their high preference.
- Agent 2 receives items 3, 1, and 6, valued at 85, 32, and 27 respectively.

This allocation ensures each agent has significant value from their allocations without envy.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 1, 6]
}
```
