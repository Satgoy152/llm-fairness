Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  61  99   6  38  91  60
1  50  51  23  65  42  78  36
2  99  87  58  33  89  85  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent believes they have received the most valuable bundle of items according to their own valuation. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the Items with Their Valuations:**

   - Agent 0 values: [7, 61, 99, 6, 38, 91, 60]
   - Agent 1 values: [50, 51, 23, 65, 42, 78, 36]
   - Agent 2 values: [99, 87, 58, 33, 89, 85, 83]

2. **Identify the Highest Valuations:**

   - Agent 0 highly values item 2.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 3.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 0.

3. **Allocate the Items Based on Highest Valuations:**

   We start by allocating items based on the highest value each agent places on them, trying to ensure each agent gets their most valued item, if possible.

4. **Iteratively Allocate Remaining Items to Balance Value:**

   After initial allocations, distribute the remaining items so that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

5. **Final Allocation:**

   Using this approach, we can allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and the distribution attempts to balance the total perceived value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.
