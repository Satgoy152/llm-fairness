Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  91  49  66  55  92  99
1  28  37  35  49  40  52  39
2  21  87  77  40  46   9  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation based on the given valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's happiness subject to the constraint that each agent should feel that their allocation is fair compared to others. We will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives the highest possible total valuation while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation. 

Here’s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 6 (99) and item 5 (92) the most. Allocating these items to Agent 0 will maximize their total valuation.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has moderate valuations across the board. Allocating items that others value less, but are still valuable to Agent 1, will be beneficial. We will allocate items 3 (49) and 4 (40) to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuations for items 1 (87) and 2 (77). Allocating these items will maximize Agent 2's total valuation.

Let’s check the allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 5 and 6, totaling a valuation of 92 + 99 = 191.
- Agent 1 gets items 3 and 4, totaling a valuation of 49 + 40 = 89.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 2, totaling a valuation of 87 + 77 = 164.

Finally, item 0 is left, which we can allocate to Agent 1, as it has a higher valuation for it than Agent 2, and it doesn’t affect the envy-freeness for Agent 0.

This allocation is:
- Agent 0: [5, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 2: [1, 2]

This allocation attempts to ensure envy-freeness as much as possible given the constraints and valuations.

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
