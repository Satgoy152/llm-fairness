Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36   4  18   1  26  17  41
1  61  42  13  39  30  96  82
2  70  43  22  13  58  21  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. A common approach to achieve fairness is to use the "round-robin" method or a similar approach to distribute the items based on the highest valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 6 (94), so we assign item 6 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5 (96), so we assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the next highest valuation for item 0 (70), so we assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation for item 0 (61), but it's already taken, so we consider item 6 (82), but it's also taken, so they take their next highest available item, which is item 4 (30).
5. **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation for item 6 (41), but it's already taken, so they take their next highest available item, which is item 0 (36), but it's also taken, so they take item 2 (18).
6. **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation for item 3 (39), so we assign item 3 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 2** has the next highest valuation for item 4 (58), but it's already taken, so they take their next highest available item, which is item 1 (43).

After this allocation, the items are fairly distributed among the agents. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences while ensuring each agent gets items as fairly as possible given their reported valuations.
