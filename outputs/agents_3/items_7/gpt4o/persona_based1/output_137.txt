Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  68  94   0   4  58  47
1  26  51  53  51  30  27  13
2  42  59  46   9  22  19  15
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly and to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to ensure that no agent feels that another agent received a better allocation based on their own valuations.

To achieve this, let's follow the strategy of maximizing each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each item is allocated.

Here are the steps to allocate the items:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2.
   - Agent 1 has relatively balanced valuations across items, but item 2 is not highly valued.
   - Agent 2 has moderate valuations, with item 1 being the highest.

2. **Greedy Allocation**:
   - Start by assigning items to the agent who values them the most to ensure the highest collective satisfaction.
   
3. **Assignment Strategy**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they have the next highest valuation for an unassigned item.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it significantly more than others.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1, again considering they have a relatively high valuation for it.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0, since they have a high valuation for it.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as they have a higher valuation for this item compared to others.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Check to ensure each item is assigned and each agent gets a fair share.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences by giving them items they value highly, ensuring a fair division.
