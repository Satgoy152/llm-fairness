Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  97  65  92  98  90  13
1  52  74   7  71  43  25  62
2  39  69  40  14  27  22  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [39 69 40 14 27 22 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent values their own bundle of items at least as highly as the bundles allocated to other agents. However, since these allocations must be integer-based, we may not achieve perfect envy-freeness but will strive to approximate it as closely as possible.

Let's examine the valuation matrix:

```
      0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agent
0    76  97  65  92  98  90  13
1    52  74   7  71  43  25  62
2    39  69  40  14  27  22  58
```

To allocate items, we can start by considering which agent values each item the highest, while trying to balance the total number of items each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

   - Item 0: Agent 0 (76), Agent 1 (52), Agent 2 (39) → Agent 0
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (97), Agent 1 (74), Agent 2 (69) → Agent 0
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (65), Agent 1 (7), Agent 2 (40) → Agent 0
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (92), Agent 1 (71), Agent 2 (14) → Agent 0
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (98), Agent 1 (43), Agent 2 (27) → Agent 0
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (90), Agent 1 (25), Agent 2 (22) → Agent 0
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (13), Agent 1 (62), Agent 2 (58) → Agent 1

Assign such that each agent gets at least one item and try to balance the total value as follows:

2. Re-allocate some items to balance the number of items:

   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1, who values it at 62, more than Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2, who values it at 22, more than Agent 1.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, 2, 3
- Agent 1 gets items 4, 6
- Agent 2 gets item 5

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and ensures all 7 items are allocated. Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5]
}
```
