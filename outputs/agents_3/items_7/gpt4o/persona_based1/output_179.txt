Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  12  77  75  65  53  77
1  58  74  10   8  53  36  49
2  18   8  96  67  18  18  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[72 12 77 75 65 53 77]
 [58 74 10  8 53 36 49]
 [18  8 96 67 18 18 90]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value as much as possible while maintaining the condition of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation, based on their own valuation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Valuation Analysis
1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: 
   - High-value items: 0 (72), 2 (77), 3 (75), 6 (77)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:
   - High-value items: 1 (74), 4 (53)

3. **Agent 2's Valuations**:
   - High-value items: 2 (96), 3 (67), 6 (90)

### Allocation Strategy
- **Agent 0** highly values items 0, 2, 3, and 6. However, item 2 is the highest value for Agent 2, and item 6 is also highly valued by Agent 2. We should prioritize items that are valuable but not the top preference of others.
  
- **Agent 1** has a strong preference for item 1, and it is not highly valued by others, making it a good choice for allocation.
  
- **Agent 2** highly values items 2, 3, and 6. Let's ensure that Agent 2 gets at least some of these items.

### Item Allocation
- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 4. This gives Agent 0 items they value highly without contesting with others for their top preferences.
  
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 1 and 5. Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 1, and item 5 is a reasonable choice given the distribution of other items.
  
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 2, 3, and 6. These are among the highest valued items for Agent 2, and they significantly prefer these over the others.

By this allocation, each agent gets a set of items they value, and the allocation is envy-free under the constraints of integer allocations.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives items, and the allocation adheres to the principles of fair division and envy-freeness.
