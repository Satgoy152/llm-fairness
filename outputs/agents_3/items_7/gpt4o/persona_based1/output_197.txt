Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  41  53  82  60  60  83
1  16  96  62  23   7  89  32
2  62  69  22  61  61  50  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. Given the valuations, we can attempt to distribute the items by maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their allocation.

Here are the steps to achieve an envy-free allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the most (value = 83).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (value = 96).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most (value = 62).

2. **Allocate each agent their highest valued item first, if possible.**

3. **Distribute remaining items by considering second highest values and ensuring each agent receives a fair share, aiming for an even distribution of total value.**

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0 Allocation:**
  - Highest valued item: 6 (value 83).
  - Next highest: 3 (value 82).

- **Agent 1 Allocation:**
  - Highest valued item: 1 (value 96).
  - Next highest: 5 (value 89).

- **Agent 2 Allocation:**
  - Highest valued item: 0 (value 62).
  - Next highest: 4 (value 61).
  - Remaining item: 2 (value 22).

This initial allocation gives each agent a fair share of the total valuation based on their preferences while ensuring all 7 items are allocated.

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 4, 2]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 6 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 5.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 4, and 2.

This distribution attempts to balance the total value each agent receives according to their preferences, thus aiming for an envy-free allocation.
