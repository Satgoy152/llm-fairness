Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  44   6  86  74  83  15
1   0  41   0  76  34  86  54
2  48  29  67  64  18  91  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a way that is fair and envy-free, let's first consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations, and ideally, none should envy another's allocation.

Let's break down the allocations in a way that attempts to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: item 3 (86), item 5 (83), item 4 (74)
   - These items are highly valued by Agent 0, so they should ideally receive most of them.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: item 5 (86), item 3 (76), item 6 (54)
   - Agent 1 highly values item 5 and item 3. Since item 5 is also highly valued by Agent 0, we may have to compromise here.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: item 5 (91), item 2 (67), item 3 (64)
   - Agent 2's highest is item 5, which is critical because it's highly valued by all. We might have to adjust allocations to balance this.

Based on these observations, here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3, 4
  - These items are highly valued by Agent 0 and provide a good share of their total valuation.

- **Agent 1**: Items 5, 6
  - Agent 1 gets item 5, which is their highest value item, and item 6 provides additional value.

- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 1, 2
  - Agent 2 receives items that provide a balanced valuation and avoids giving them item 5, which is key to minimizing overall envy.

Let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the agents' valuations and minimize envy by considering the highest-valued items for each agent and distributing them accordingly.
