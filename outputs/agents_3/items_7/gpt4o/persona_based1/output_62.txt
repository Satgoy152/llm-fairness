Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86   5  79  87  67  96  66
1  88   9  66  61  97   9  22
2  71  50  93  18  34  35  69
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[86  5 79 87 67 96 66]
 [88  9 66 61 97  9 22]
 [71 50 93 18 34 35 69]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent prefers their own bundle of items over any other agent's bundle. One simple approach is to use the maximum sum of valuations for each agent and try to distribute items in such a way that no agent envies another.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 86 + 5 + 79 + 87 + 67 + 96 + 66 = 486
- Agent 1: 88 + 9 + 66 + 61 + 97 + 9 + 22 = 352
- Agent 2: 71 + 50 + 93 + 18 + 34 + 35 + 69 = 370

Now, we'll distribute items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the most (96), followed by item 3 (87), and item 0 (86).
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most (97), followed by item 0 (88), and item 2 (66).
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most (93), followed by item 6 (69), and item 1 (50).

A potential fair allocation considering these preferences could be:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 5, 0
- Agent 1: Items 4, 2
- Agent 2: Items 6, 1

Let's finalize this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives some of their most valued items, thereby minimizing envy among them.
