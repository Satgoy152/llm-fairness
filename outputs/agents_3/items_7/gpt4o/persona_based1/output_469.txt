Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  48  51  56  41  26  38
1  11  19  28  90  36  46  28
2  45  40  58  98  76  57  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the three agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness or an approximate version of it. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation, meaning each agent should feel they received at least as much value as any other agent.

Given the valuations, we will try to allocate items so that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here's a strategy for doing this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to balance the allocations so that each agent receives a fair share of the total value.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 51 + 48 + 51 + 56 + 41 + 26 + 38 = 311
- Agent 1: 11 + 19 + 28 + 90 + 36 + 46 + 28 = 258
- Agent 2: 45 + 40 + 58 + 98 + 76 + 57 + 55 = 429

Next, we will allocate the items to balance the total value across agents:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0, 1, 2
   - Total value: 51 + 48 + 51 = 150

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 3, 5
   - Total value: 90 + 46 = 136

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 4, 6
   - Total value: 76 + 55 = 131

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their valuation of the items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.
