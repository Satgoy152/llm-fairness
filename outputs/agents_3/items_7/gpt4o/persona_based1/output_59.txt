Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  29   4  32  52  96  82
1  76  93  51  56  52  48   7
2  90   5  81  36  69  88  24
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76 29  4 32 52 96 82]
 [76 93 51 56 52 48  7]
 [90  5 81 36 69 88 24]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) method. The MNW method seeks to maximize the product of the utilities (valuations) each agent receives, which often results in an envy-free allocation.

Let's first summarize the problem:

- There are 3 agents (0, 1, 2).
- There are 7 items (0 to 6).
  
The valuation matrix is:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 76 | 29 | 4  | 32 | 52 | 96 | 82 |
| 1          | 76 | 93 | 51 | 56 | 52 | 48 | 7  |
| 2          | 90 | 5  | 81 | 36 | 69 | 88 | 24 |

We need to allocate all 7 items among the 3 agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items and the allocation is as fair as possible.

One potential allocation that maximizes fairness is:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 6
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, 4
- Agent 2 receives items 2, 5

This allocation ensures that:

- Agent 0 has a total valuation of 76 + 82 = 158.
- Agent 1 has a total valuation of 93 + 56 + 52 = 201.
- Agent 2 has a total valuation of 81 + 88 = 169.

This allocation is relatively balanced, considering the valuations and attempting to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
