Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  79   6   6  25  62  32
1  84  44  39  76  93  44   0
2  84  56  36  39   4  74  24
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[34 79  6  6 25 62 32]
 [84 44 39 76 93 44  0]
 [84 56 36 39  4 74 24]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation or as close as possible to it. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [34, 79, 6, 6, 25, 62, 32]
- Agent 1 values: [84, 44, 39, 76, 93, 44, 0]
- Agent 2 values: [84, 56, 36, 39, 4, 74, 24]

One approach is to assign items to maximize the total value each agent receives, while trying to balance the allocation and reduce envy.

### Possible Allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent first:
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most at 93.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 84.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most at 79.

2. Then assign remaining items, considering the next highest valuations:
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (76) and Item 2 (39).
   - Agent 0: Item 5 (62) and Item 6 (32).
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (56).

### Resulting Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 4, 3, 2
- Agent 2: Items 0

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them the items they value the most, while ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [4, 3, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
