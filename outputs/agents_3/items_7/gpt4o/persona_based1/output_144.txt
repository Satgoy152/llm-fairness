Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  27  21  79   8  44  11
1  35  38   8  64   4   5  98
2  28  46  78  22  79  32  29
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 38  8 64  4  5 98]
 [28 46 78 22 79 32 29]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, meaning each agent feels they received at least as much value as any other agent with their allocation. Since we are dealing with integer allocations, we will attempt to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the perceived fairness based on the agents' valuations.

Let's evaluate the valuations of each item for each agent:

- Agent 0: [31, 27, 21, 79, 8, 44, 11]
- Agent 1: [35, 38, 8, 64, 4, 5, 98]
- Agent 2: [28, 46, 78, 22, 79, 32, 29]

To start, we'll assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 35.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 46.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 78.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 79.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 79.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 44.

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 98.

Assign these items to the agents:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 6
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, 4

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize fairness based on the valuations provided, by ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly and minimizing envy.
