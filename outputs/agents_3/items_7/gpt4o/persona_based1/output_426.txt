Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79   4  92  34  16   3  44
1  94  36  48  74  17  39  88
2  61  21  56  53  12  40  39
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[79  4 92 34 16  3 44]
 [94 36 48 74 17 39 88]
 [61 21 56 53 12 40 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, according to their valuations.

Given the valuations table:

- Agent 0 values: [79, 4, 92, 34, 16, 3, 44]
- Agent 1 values: [94, 36, 48, 74, 17, 39, 88]
- Agent 2 values: [61, 21, 56, 53, 12, 40, 39]

Let's try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while considering fairness. We can use a greedy approach, where each agent picks their most valued remaining item in turns until all items are allocated.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0** picks Item 2 (value 92)
2. **Agent 1** picks Item 0 (value 94)
3. **Agent 2** picks Item 5 (value 40)
4. **Agent 0** picks Item 6 (value 44)
5. **Agent 1** picks Item 3 (value 74)
6. **Agent 2** picks Item 4 (value 12)
7. **Agent 0** picks Item 1 (value 4)

Let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 6, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 4]

All items are allocated, and each agent receives a bundle according to their preferences as much as possible under the constraints.

### Allocations in JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 4]
}
```
