Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  51  21  73  54  98  19   6  53
1   8  90  62  81   8  45  59  73  17
2  47  93  47  67  57  30  94  11  73
3  78  15  61  86  92  28  56  40  25
4  56  18  17  65  48  33  83  47  80
5  32   3  69  14  95  49  37  43  63
6  81  11  14  85  14  32  88  27  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest value for each agent.
2. Ensure that each item is assigned to only one agent.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure all agents have at least one item if possible, or distribute the remaining items fairly.

Here's a possible allocation strategy for this problem:

- Agent 0: Assign item 5 (value 98) – the highest value for agent 0.
- Agent 1: Assign item 1 (value 90) – the highest value for agent 1.
- Agent 2: Assign item 6 (value 94) – the highest value for agent 2.
- Agent 3: Assign item 4 (value 92) – the highest value for agent 3.
- Agent 4: Assign item 8 (value 80) – the highest value for agent 4.
- Agent 5: Assign item 4 (value 95) – this overlaps with agent 3, so let's give another high value item like item 2 (value 69).
- Agent 6: Assign item 0 (value 81) – the highest value for agent 6.

Now, let's verify all items are allocated:

- Items allocated: 5, 1, 6, 4, 8, 2, 0
- Remaining items: 3, 7

Distribute the remaining items:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 6 (value 85).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 73).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, and the assignment aims to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.
