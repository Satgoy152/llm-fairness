Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  77  97  89  87  48  12  34   7
1  90  26  33  19  24  25  71  24  16
2  60   8  32  56  81  36  88  50  17
3  98   5  74  86  36   8  58  79  69
4  52  23  53  60  69  24  39  88  57
5  30   8  95   4  55  24  80  92  92
6  80  98   2  24  31  90  50  69   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's approach this by considering the highest valued items for each agent and distributing them accordingly. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (97) and item 0 (89).
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (90) but it's already taken, next is item 6 (71).
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly (88) but it's already taken, next is item 4 (81).
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly (98) but it's already taken, next is item 3 (86).
- Agent 4 values item 7 highly (88).
- Agent 5 values item 2 highly (95) but it's already taken, next is item 8 (92).
- Agent 6 values item 1 highly (98).

Now, let's check and finalize the allocation so that all items are allocated.

1. Agent 0: Take items 0, 2.
2. Agent 1: Take items 6.
3. Agent 2: Take items 4.
4. Agent 3: Take items 3.
5. Agent 4: Take items 7.
6. Agent 5: Take items 8.
7. Agent 6: Take items 1.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [1]
}
```
