Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  18  39   5  81   6  93  99   9
1  72  79  30  63  62  81  94  79  24
2  73  13  21  10  88  23  16  75  25
3  69  28  94  79  64  30  25  24  59
4   8  46  78  31  97  81  74  25  87
5  59  90  30  72  84  82  78  59  18
6  62  64  36  91  91  27  13  15  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total perceived value for all agents, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 6, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 5
- Agent 2 receives items: 4
- Agent 3 receives items: 2
- Agent 4 receives items: 8
- Agent 5 receives items: 1
- Agent 6 receives items: 3

This allocation distributes all 9 items and considers the highest valuations for each agent. Here is the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [3]
}
```
