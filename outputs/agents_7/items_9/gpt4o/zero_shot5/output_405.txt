Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  84  64  59  90  36  91  39  81
1  79  89  70  59  37  80   8  27  70
2  58  37  22   3  79  33  68  94  87
3  14  12  79  16  98  23  51  40  71
4  62  87  19  43  89  67  44  34  68
5  27  53  64  20  40  62  27  81  95
6  11  63  59  56  61  13  64  35  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly. We aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List Items by Value for Each Agent:** Start by sorting items based on the agents' valuations.

2. **Allocate Items:** Distribute the items to the agents by giving each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and all items are distributed.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** If any allocations result in an imbalance (i.e., one agent gets too many more items than another), adjust by swapping items between agents to ensure fairness while keeping the total valuation reasonable.

Following these guidelines, here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated equals the total number of items available (9 items). Each allocation attempts to respect the agents' item valuations as closely as possible.
