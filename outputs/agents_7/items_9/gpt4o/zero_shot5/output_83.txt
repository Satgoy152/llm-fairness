Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  70  36  36  61   3  41  22  67
1  80  79  84  61  39   0  99  34  56
2  39   5  15  78  28  19  93  46  97
3   0  89  73  83  33  16  10  26  53
4  11  99  74  31  91  23  85   6  61
5  94  88  86  54  10  67  15  34  88
6  48  42  81  29  21  67  51  32  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Since there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive none.

1. First, let's identify the highest valuation each agent has for any item and consider allocating that item to the respective agent if it hasn't already been claimed by another agent with a higher valuation.

2. Next, we'll ensure that each item is allocated, and no item is allocated to more than one agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (70).
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most (99).
- Agent 2 values item 8 the most (97).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (83).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most (99), but it is already claimed by Agent 0. Agent 4's next highest is item 4 (91).
- Agent 5 values item 0 the most (94).
- Agent 6 values item 2 the most (81).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to ensure all items are distributed:

- Items 5 and 7 remain unallocated. 

Let's allocate them to agents based on their next highest preferences:

- Agent 5 also has a high preference for item 5 (67). We'll allocate item 5 to Agent 5.
- Agent 0 also values item 7 (22). We'll allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 5],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned while each agent gets a fair distribution based on their highest valuations.
