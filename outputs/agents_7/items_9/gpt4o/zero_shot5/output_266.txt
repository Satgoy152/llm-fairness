Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  22  34  26  65  40  65  35  94
1  97  65   8  63  98   2  35  21  15
2  88  90  26  98  21  50  12   3  87
3  38  43  72  47  81  23  81  77  79
4  42  55  14   7  70  68  44   5  29
5  51  68  75  56  51  92  83  23  33
6  41  52  60  62  94  52  70  20  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Since there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others might not receive any. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives for their assigned items. 

Here's a possible allocation that attempts to balance the valuations across agents:

1. Assign item 8 to agent 0 (valuation 94).
2. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (valuation 98).
3. Assign item 3 to agent 2 (valuation 98).
4. Assign item 7 to agent 3 (valuation 77).
5. Assign item 5 to agent 4 (valuation 68).
6. Assign item 2 to agent 5 (valuation 75).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 6 (valuation 70).
8. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (valuation 97).
9. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (valuation 90).

This allocation considers the highest valued items for each agent and ensures that all items are distributed while maximizing the agents' total valuation. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [6]
}
```
