Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  96  60  83  29   4  91  34  50
1  42  24  24  85  71   4   9  57  93
2  80  66  29  63  91   9  45  17  50
3  48  47  33  69  31  57  62  94  32
4   0  38  57  41  97  70   0  99  71
5  59  41  21  43  15  47  89  20  85
6  25   6  39  62  42  65   1   3  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a portion of the items such that the overall distribution appears equitable based on their valuations. This can be approached by trying to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated.

Here's one possible allocation based on maximizing the value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items to maximize their total valuation. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 6. Allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Next, finding high-value items for Agent 1 that haven't been allocated yet, items 8 and 3 have high values for Agent 1. Since item 3 is already taken, allocate item 8 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 4 highly. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 7 highly. Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 5 highly. Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 2 highly. Allocate item 2 to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: Agent 6 values item 0 highly. Allocate item 0 to Agent 6.

Now let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated, while trying to respect each agent's preferences based on their valuations.
