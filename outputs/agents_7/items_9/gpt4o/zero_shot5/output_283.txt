Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  58  37  22  96  23  43  49  29
1  21  35  91  78  48  42  73  89  82
2  43  92  22  90  35  56  51  63  13
3  44  54   7  22  94  98  75  32   5
4   9  93  13  63  89  69   5  27   8
5   2   0  25  23  63  47  41  68  61
6  19  81  91  44  37  30  94  39  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, as the total number of items (9) is equal to the number of agents. 

Let's analyze the valuation matrix and allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 (96).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (91).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 (92).
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5 (98).
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 3 (63).
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 8 (61).
7. Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 6 (94).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items fairly:

- Item 0: The highest remaining valuation is for Agent 0 (81).
- Item 7: The highest remaining valuation is for Agent 1 (89).

By these allocations, we ensure that each agent receives an item they value highly, and all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [6]
}
```
