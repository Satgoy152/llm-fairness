Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  27  68  37  97  57  48  22  92
1  76  75  16  94  75  87  44  87  58
2  79  68  36  18  40   5  88  96  11
3  84  14   2  15  42   2  95  20  31
4  60  90  66  10  41  61  30  72  53
5   9  63  72  95  62   5  70  40  88
6  49  75  14  47  61  97  16  62  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 7 agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that agents receive items with higher valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated and no agent receives more than a fair share given the constraints.

Considering each agent's preferences and attempting to balance the allocations, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 8
- Agent 1: Items 3, 5
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Items 1
- Agent 5: Item 2
- Agent 6: Item 0

This allocation ensures that each agent has a chance to receive items they value, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0]
}
```
