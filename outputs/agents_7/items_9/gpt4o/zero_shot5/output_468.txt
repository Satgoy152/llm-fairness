Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  11   3  40  20  62  12  66  87
1  32  82  92  10  51  71  74  84  34
2  31  17  65  38  30  71  45  70  89
3  32  85  91   0  14  81   3  80   5
4  75  74  79  66  46  53  28   7  44
5  76  21  37  29  29  14  91  49  30
6  85   7  48  84  93  94  35  34  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [85  7 48 84 93 94 35 34 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and distribute the items in a way that optimizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (since there are 7 agents and 9 items).

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 3 (value 40) and item 6 (value 12).
- Agent 1 receives item 2 (value 92) and item 1 (value 82).
- Agent 2 receives item 8 (value 89).
- Agent 3 receives item 5 (value 81).
- Agent 4 receives item 0 (value 75).
- Agent 5 receives item 4 (value 29).
- Agent 6 receives item 7 (value 34).

Now, following the specified JSON format, here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.
