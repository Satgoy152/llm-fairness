Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  31  83  57   3  86  40  45  71
1  29  41  78  73  11  58  80  26  60
2  26  97  14  42  35  76  45  73  94
3   2  60  89  21  37  47  31  75  22
4  57  38  64  61  88  97  35  17  33
5  13  96  91  55  10  62  92   7  72
6  96  42  77  48  87  89  60   1  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can try a few different allocation strategies. A common approach is to maximize the total valuation or to ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, considering their preferences.

One simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent receives items proportional to their valuations while also ensuring everyone gets at least one item if possible. However, with 7 agents and only 9 items, not all agents will receive an item.

Here's one way to allocate the items fairly:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and allocate it to the respective agent if that agent has fewer items compared to others.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's one potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 8
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 5
- Agent 5: Item 7
- Agent 6: Items 0, 3, 4

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [0, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize individual valuations while ensuring a fair distribution of items.
