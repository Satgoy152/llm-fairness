Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  59  92  93  99   9  28  67  87
1  99  63  26   3  82  61  87  53   8
2  28  73  56  60  62  34  92  74  29
3  24  12   0  25  71  51  20  66  65
4  41  30  54  56  13  69  53  70  47
5  97   8  34  33   3  18  36  63  38
6  71  79   3  35  65  42  53  53  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. However, since there are more agents than items, some agents may not receive any items. We should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction based on the valuations provided.

Let's evaluate the situation and allocate the items:

1. Start by allocating items to agents with the highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets an item if possible.

2. Ensure that the total number of items allocated equals 9.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 highly, so allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly, so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly, so allocate item 6 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly, so allocate item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 7 highly, so allocate item 7 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 8 highly, so allocate item 8 to agent 5.
- Agent 6 values item 1 highly, so allocate item 1 to agent 6.

Now, we have allocated 7 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items.

Review the remaining items (2, 5) and allocate them to the agents who would benefit the most:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly, so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly, so allocate item 5 to agent 3.

Now, all 9 items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent who receives an item gets one of their highly valued items, and all items have been allocated.
