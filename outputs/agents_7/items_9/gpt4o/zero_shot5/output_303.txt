Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  38  31  80   4  70  13  72   8
1  54  36  48  60   6  28  72  68  99
2  11  73  72  61  96  64   6  93  57
3  33  40  14  13  73  66  51   5  67
4  37  95  51  31  32   1  70  62  29
5  34   0   6  13  27  89  84  29  68
6  57  70  15  60   5   6  50  20   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we can use a simple approach to ensure each agent receives a reasonable distribution based on their valuations. The goal is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuation for item 0 (98), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has high valuation for item 8 (99), so allocate item 8 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has high valuation for item 4 (96), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has high valuation for item 5 (66), so allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has high valuation for item 1 (95), so allocate item 1 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 has high valuation for item 7 (29), so allocate item 7 to Agent 5.
7. Agent 6 has high valuation for item 3 (60), so allocate item 3 to Agent 6.
8. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2, as they also have a high valuation (72) for it.
9. Allocate item 6 to Agent 5, as they have a high valuation (84) for it.

This ensures all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item, except for Agent 0, who only needed one item due to the high valuation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7, 6],
    "6": [3]
}
```
