Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  28  93  43  73  19  76  50  52
1  86  29  54  42  41  58  16  96  97
2  24  18  82   8  14  27   1  89  69
3  31   0  38  22  98  30  67  69  86
4  79  12  55  97  19  27  46  14  35
5  91  15  11  15  55  91  23  19   4
6  99   5  14  64   7  77  80  44  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to distribute them such that each agent gets items that maximize their value while ensuring that all items are allocated. We'll make sure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, considering there are 9 items and 7 agents.

Here's a proposed allocation based on maximizing the sum of values for each agent:

1. Agent 0:
   - Item 2 (value 93)
   - Item 4 (value 73)
   
2. Agent 1:
   - Item 8 (value 97)
   - Item 7 (value 96)

3. Agent 2:
   - Item 3 (value 8) 

4. Agent 3:
   - Item 5 (value 30)

5. Agent 4:
   - Item 0 (value 79)
   
6. Agent 5:
   - Item 6 (value 23)
   
7. Agent 6:
   - Item 1 (value 5)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all nine items are distributed. Now, in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [8, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [1]
}
```
