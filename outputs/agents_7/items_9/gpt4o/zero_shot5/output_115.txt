Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  43  60  36  97  63   8  37  20
1  99  78  18  29  46  72  71  98  46
2  69  50  17  50   5  82  33   8  70
3  14  92  79  78  72  51  12  20  43
4   2  72  69   6  97  50  87  76  29
5  36  16  22  91  39  12  11  37  22
6  96  74  94  52  69  20  15  14  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives. Given that there are 7 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive none. We will aim to distribute the items such that the allocations are as fair as possible based on the given valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocating the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: For each agent, sum the values of all items to get a sense of which items are most valuable to them.

2. **Allocate Items Based on High Valuation**: Assign items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible), considering the total number of items (9) and agents (7).

3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Make sure exactly 9 items are allocated in total.

Using this approach, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 4 (value 97).
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 7 (values 99 and 98).
- Agent 2 gets item 5 (value 82).
- Agent 3 gets items 1 and 2 (values 92 and 79).
- Agent 4 gets item 6 (value 87).
- Agent 5 gets item 3 (value 91).
- Agent 6 gets item 8 (value 24).

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [8]
}
```
