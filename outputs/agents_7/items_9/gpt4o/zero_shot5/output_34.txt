Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  52  88  20  95  37  95   1  53
1  93   2  69  20  39  77  97  54  82
2  75  84  72  34  64  12  74  43  55
3  98  72  84  93  91  28  89  39  13
4  82  72  19  33  64  43  42  98  71
5  74  15  23  42  14  95  28  22  22
6  73  26   9  17  14  40  18  29  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This method doesn't guarantee a perfectly fair distribution in terms of quantity, but it ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most.

Let's analyze the given valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most at 98.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most at 84.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 88.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most at 93.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 95.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 5 values it the most at 95.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 4 values it the most at 98.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 6 values it the most at 76.

Based on the above allocations, here is the distribution of items among the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [8]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all 9 items are allocated.
