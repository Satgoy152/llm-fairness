Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  57  28   2  76  49  29  84  16
1  69  51  27  10  80   3   6  34  69
2  62  89  70  33  70  64  24  13  54
3  30  65  20  30  47  98  52  97  35
4  47  82  19  83  38   3  13  97  97
5  48  39  14  67   2  41  82  90  87
6  31  98   1  13  51  98  88  10  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 57 28  2 76 49 29 84 16]
 [69 51 27 10 80  3  6 34 69]
 [62 89 70 33 70 64 24 13 54]
 [30 65 20 30 47 98 52 97 35]
 [47 82 19 83 38  3 13 97 97]
 [48 39 14 67  2 41 82 90 87]
 [31 98  1 13 51 98 88 10 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the total value of items each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Below is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 7 (value 84)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 4 (value 80)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 1 (value 89)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 5 (value 98)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 8 (value 97)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 6 (value 82)
7. **Agent 6**: Items 3 (value 13), 0 (value 31), and 2 (value 1)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item while attempting to balance the total value. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [3, 0, 2]
}
```
