Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  50  54  25  14  80  87  67  75
1  75  85  54  69  81  61  14  77   6
2  18  15  84  89  12  13  25  14  51
3  66  58  30  25  95  64  35  57   5
4  52   5  73  61  20  32  45  47  40
5  45   4  60  54  85   6  14  15  26
6  81  86  42  20  47  57  52  46  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a similar value. One approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the remaining items until all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Begin by assigning the item that each agent values the most:
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the most (87).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (81).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most (89).
   - Agent 3 values item 4 the most (95), but since it's already taken, we assign their next highest, item 1 (58).
   - Agent 4 values item 2 the most (73).
   - Agent 5 values item 4 the most (85), but since it's already taken, we assign their next highest, item 3 (54).
   - Agent 6 values item 1 the most (86), but since it's already taken, we assign their next highest, item 0 (81).

2. Allocate remaining items by repeating a similar process, selecting the highest valued unallocated item for each agent.

Following this approach, here is one possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
