Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  64  69  53  17  71  33  28  76
1  46  10  31  45  80  72  43  87   6
2  35  10  59  12   2  78  80  45  82
3  65   1  52  85  94  30  63  74   4
4  69  71  24  83  57  79  54  80  20
5  23  26  97  22  24  12  72  42  14
6  69  41  79  71  27  89  54  49  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Given there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive none. The goal is to try and maximize the total satisfaction or value for all agents while distributing items fairly.

Here's a suggestion for allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation for each agent.
2. Ensure that all 9 items are distributed.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 8.
- Agent 1 values item 7 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 8 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 5 values item 2 highly.
- Agent 6 values item 5 highly.

Given this, one possible allocation could be:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it highly, while ensuring all items are distributed. Agent 6 receives an additional two items to ensure all items are allocated.
