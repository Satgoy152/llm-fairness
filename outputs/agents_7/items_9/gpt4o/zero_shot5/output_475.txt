Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  49  93  80  89  23   3  55  90
1  60  40  71  92  46  48  86  69  88
2  49  64  41  71  89  83  98  96  19
3  78   9  13  49  85   4  73  28  98
4   5  69  71   9  46  30  59  11  98
5  25  72  45  34  30  19  20  69   5
6  89  66  70  82  52  36  25  10  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to ensure that each agent receives a number of items that balances their total valuation as evenly as possible. Given there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Let's proceed with a simple allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents to balance the total valuation of items each agent receives.

Here are the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: \(37 + 49 + 93 + 80 + 89 + 23 + 3 + 55 + 90 = 519\)
- Agent 1: \(60 + 40 + 71 + 92 + 46 + 48 + 86 + 69 + 88 = 600\)
- Agent 2: \(49 + 64 + 41 + 71 + 89 + 83 + 98 + 96 + 19 = 610\)
- Agent 3: \(78 + 9 + 13 + 49 + 85 + 4 + 73 + 28 + 98 = 437\)
- Agent 4: \(5 + 69 + 71 + 9 + 46 + 30 + 59 + 11 + 98 = 398\)
- Agent 5: \(25 + 72 + 45 + 34 + 30 + 19 + 20 + 69 + 5 = 319\)
- Agent 6: \(89 + 66 + 70 + 82 + 52 + 36 + 25 + 10 + 92 = 522\)

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [0, 8] (Valuation = 37 + 90 = 127)
- Agent 1: [3, 6] (Valuation = 92 + 86 = 178)
- Agent 2: [7] (Valuation = 96)
- Agent 3: [4] (Valuation = 85)
- Agent 4: [2] (Valuation = 71)
- Agent 5: [1] (Valuation = 72)
- Agent 6: [5] (Valuation = 36)

This allocation assigns each item to exactly one agent, and every agent is included in the allocation.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [5]
}
```
