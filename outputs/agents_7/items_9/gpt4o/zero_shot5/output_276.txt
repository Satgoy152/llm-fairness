Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  70  54  38  62  94  60  54  11
1  49  53  70  48  57  88  74  90  24
2  23  53  85  85  28  20  80  12  48
3  48  38  31  82  70  99  41  47  31
4  32   0  95  76  26  76   4  59  74
5  11   5  61  89  31  83  61  14  58
6  11  54  44  10  19  14  86  82  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. The goal is to distribute all 9 items among the 7 agents.

Here's a possible fair allocation of the items to the agents:

- **Agent 0:** Items [1, 5]
  - Valuations: 70 (item 1) + 94 (item 5) = 164
- **Agent 1:** Items [3, 7]
  - Valuations: 48 (item 3) + 90 (item 7) = 138
- **Agent 2:** Item [2]
  - Valuations: 85 (item 2) = 85
- **Agent 3:** Item [4]
  - Valuations: 70 (item 4) = 70
- **Agent 4:** Item [8]
  - Valuations: 74 (item 8) = 74
- **Agent 5:** Item [0]
  - Valuations: 11 (item 0) = 11
- **Agent 6:** Item [6]
  - Valuations: 86 (item 6) = 86

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the distribution of high-value items among the agents while ensuring that every agent receives at least one item.
