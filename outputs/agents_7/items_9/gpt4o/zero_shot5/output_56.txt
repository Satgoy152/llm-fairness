Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  23  59  47   3  83  33  59   9
1  32  87  49  82  54  76  72  49  39
2  68  94  44  50   1  83  65  79   9
3  34  63  54  45   6  39  78  99  84
4  23  92  62  36  68  67   7  11  18
5  62  26   6  14  70  89  29  20  46
6  90  78  24   4  71  41  73  55  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Given that there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but we should ensure that the allocation is as balanced and fair as possible.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and assign that item to the corresponding agent.
2. If two agents have the same highest valuation for an item, consider overall balance and spread of items among agents.
3. Ensure that every item is assigned to exactly one agent, and no agent receives more than 2 items (since we only have 9 items and 7 agents).

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Item 0: Agent 6 has the highest valuation with 90.
- Item 1: Agent 2 has the highest valuation with 94.
- Item 2: Agent 0 has the highest valuation with 59.
- Item 3: Agent 1 has the highest valuation with 82.
- Item 4: Agent 6 has the highest valuation with 71.
- Item 5: Agent 0 has the highest valuation with 83.
- Item 6: Agent 3 has the highest valuation with 78.
- Item 7: Agent 3 has the highest valuation with 99.
- Item 8: Agent 3 has the highest valuation with 84.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and the distribution remains fair:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Item [1]
- Agent 3: Items [6, 7, 8]
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: No items
- Agent 6: Items [0, 4]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and agents with the highest valuation for an item get that item. Hereâ€™s the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6, 7, 8],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0, 4]
}
```
