Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  90  48  98  43  78  15  36  93
1  18  41  31  89  49  98   1  19  54
2  28  82  53  75  85  46  97  60  98
3  25   1  63  62  78  68  58  39  82
4  32  62  56  29  25  12  50  28  69
5  27  59  11  79  15  98  67  27  11
6  80  80  38  46  42  85  88  55  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total valuation of their assigned items while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Given that there are 9 items and 7 agents, it means two of the agents will receive two items, and the remaining five will receive one item each.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning the item with the highest value for each agent.
2. If there are more items left, assign them based on the next highest valuation for the remaining items.

Following this method, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (value 98)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (value 98)
- Agent 2: Item 8 (value 98)
- Agent 3: Item 2 (value 63)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (value 62)
- Agent 5: Item 4 (value 15)
- Agent 6: Item 0 (value 80)
- Remaining items: 6, 7

Assigning the remaining items:

- Agent 5: Item 6 (value 67)
- Agent 6: Item 7 (value 55)

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4, 6],
    "6": [0, 7]
}
```
