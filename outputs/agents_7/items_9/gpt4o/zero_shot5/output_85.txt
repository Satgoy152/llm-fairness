Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  18  78  92  14  55  20  54  37
1  77   0  57   6  42  18  13  38  81
2  61  42  54  81  95  73  10  29  84
3  87  51   5  22  16   3   2  49  53
4  52  77  68  81  89  83   2  26  76
5  19  87  43  12  21  82  60  82  83
6  30  75  58  68  72  79  79  45  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. One approach to achieve this is to allocate items based on each agent’s highest valuations.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (92), 2 (78), and 5 (55).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (77) and 8 (81).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (95) and 8 (84).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (87).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (89) and 5 (83).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (87) and 5 (82).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (79) and 6 (79).

We aim to distribute the items so that every agent has a chance to get a high-value item, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

After considering the values, here is the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 3, 2
- Agent 1 gets items: 8
- Agent 2 gets items: 4
- Agent 3 gets items: 0
- Agent 4 gets items: 5
- Agent 5 gets items: 1
- Agent 6 gets items: 6, 7

Now, let’s put this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 7 agents, with some agents receiving more than one item based on their highest valuations.
