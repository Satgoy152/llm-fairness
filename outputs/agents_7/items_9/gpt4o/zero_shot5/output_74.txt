Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  91  53   0  99   6  30  15  97
1  30  11  25  32  72  11  86   9  82
2   6  87  61  14  78  53  49  26  89
3  12  96   5  51  76  28  89   1  32
4  90  95  43  53  46  39   8  43  10
5  28  28  71  80  90  63  85   6  46
6  38  67  92  25  29  19   0  69  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. The goal is to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) is as high as possible.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is 4 (value 99).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 6 (value 86).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 8 (value 89).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 1 (value 96).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item is 0 (value 90).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value item is 3 (value 80).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value item is 2 (value 92).

Now, letâ€™s ensure each item is allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Assign item 6 to agent 1.
- Assign item 8 to agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to agent 3.
- Assign item 0 to agent 4.
- Assign item 3 to agent 5.
- Assign item 2 to agent 6.

Upon checking, we have assigned the first seven items. Now, allocate the remaining two items (5 and 7) to agents that might benefit:

- Assign item 5 to agent 5 (second-highest value after item 3).
- Assign item 7 to agent 6 (second-highest value after item 2).

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3, 5],
    "6": [2, 7]
}
```
