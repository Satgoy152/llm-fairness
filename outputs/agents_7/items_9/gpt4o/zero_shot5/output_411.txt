Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  45   7  90  60  80  20  41  73
1  67  73  49  67  60  51  79  55  49
2  99   4   7  45  92   4  16  11   4
3  41   5   5  11   7  15   2  53  92
4  72  11  75  66  39  89  82  35  33
5  57  39  42  79  86   9  44  23  27
6  49  11  61  41  42  40  79  55  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. A common approach to achieve fairness is to allocate items based on maximizing the total value for each agent or ensuring that each agent receives a proportional share of the value.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Start by identifying the highest value an agent has for each item and allocate that item to the respective agent.
2. If two agents have the same value for a particular item, allocate based on ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, or randomly resolve ties.

Here's one possible allocation based on maximizing the total value each agent receives:

- Item 0: Highest value is agent 2 with 99.
- Item 1: Highest value is agent 1 with 73.
- Item 2: Highest value is agent 4 with 75.
- Item 3: Highest value is agent 0 with 90.
- Item 4: Highest value is agent 2 with 92.
- Item 5: Highest value is agent 0 with 80.
- Item 6: Highest value is agent 1 with 79.
- Item 7: Highest value is agent 3 with 53.
- Item 8: Highest value is agent 3 with 92.

Allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent that values it the highest, while ensuring each agent receives items based on their highest valuations.
