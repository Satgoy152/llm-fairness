Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  17   8  24  93  51  93  86  87
1  66  41   9  30  19  37  46  22  54
2  88  96  86  96  78   8  67  13   5
3  30  61  23  72  14  65  80  67  69
4   9  76  29  10  58  49  62  26  21
5  32  13  96  59  72   5  33  95  74
6  94  90  91  71  32  41  90  31  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider both the valuations and the total number of items. Since there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while some might receive none or just one. The goal is to distribute the items so that the overall satisfaction or total valuation is reasonably balanced among agents.

Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent has for any item.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the highest value for that item, if that agent hasn't exceeded a fair share.
3. Continue until all items are assigned.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 4 (value 93)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (value 66)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (value 96)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (value 80)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (value 49)
- Agent 5: Item 2 (value 96)
- Agent 6: Item 3 (value 71), Item 7 (value 31), Item 8 (value 31)

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [3, 7, 8]
}
```
