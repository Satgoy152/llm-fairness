Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  11  97  32  19  37  55  27  70
1  72  12  54  47  52  27  27  91  41
2  65  92  44  75   5  43  14  47  71
3  79  92  74  93  95  29  27  98  91
4  86  33   1  49   4  99  82  77   5
5  81  72  10  89  79  96  70  88   8
6  84  31  59  83  81  15  68  63   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. **List each agent's highest valued items**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (97).
   - Agent 1 values item 7 the highest (91).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (92).
   - Agent 3 values item 7 the highest (98), followed by item 4 (95).
   - Agent 4 values item 5 the highest (99).
   - Agent 5 values item 5 the highest (96).
   - Agent 6 values item 0 the highest (84).

2. **Assign items considering the highest valuations and ensuring all items are allocated**:
   - Agent 0 is assigned item 2.
   - Agent 1 is assigned item 7.
   - Agent 2 is assigned item 1.
   - Agent 3 is assigned item 4.
   - Agent 4 is assigned item 5.
   - Agent 5 is assigned item 3.
   - Agent 6 is assigned item 0.

3. **Allocate remaining items (6 and 8)**:
   - Agent 3 can take item 8 (91), as it's their next highest valued item after item 7.
   - Agent 4 can take item 6 (82), as they have a relatively high valuation for it and already have item 5.

This ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives items that they highly value, maximizing overall satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [0]
}
```
