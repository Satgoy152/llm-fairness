Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  50   7  53  16  16  32  24  80
1  51  31  60  40  43  97  60  25  94
2  98  73  71  48  78  97  78  76  47
3  54  16  97  50  41  54  86  28  10
4  37  99  92   0  86  85  79  21  77
5   7  59  18  14  97  16  26  54  35
6  54  37  46  34  63  37  79  67  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives. This can be done by looking at the valuations and trying to maximize fairness in distribution. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest value each agent has for any item, and allocate that item to the respective agent if it is not already allocated.
2. Continue the allocation by ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Following this approach, here is a potential allocation of the items among the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. It also attempts to distribute the items in a way that maintains a balance in the total value received by each agent based on their valuations.
