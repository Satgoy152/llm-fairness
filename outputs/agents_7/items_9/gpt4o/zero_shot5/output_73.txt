Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  87  33  87  15  41  99  72  47
1  12  78  36  90  84   7  96  56  50
2  71  33  16  46  57  48   3  37  52
3  87  28  34  79  71  18  89  34  24
4  47  43  62  70  63  29  89  99   2
5  92  42  17  30  43   6  17  22  65
6  91  55  45  47  40  29  41  74  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we can try to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents based on their valuations. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's analyze the valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most at 87.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 87.
3. Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most at 62.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 90.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 84.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 48.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 99.
8. Item 7: Agent 4 values it the most at 99.
9. Item 8: Agent 5 values it the most at 65.

Given this allocation strategy, we need to ensure each agent is listed in the final allocation, even if they receive no items. Here's a fair allocation based on the highest valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 7],
    "5": [8],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, respecting their highest valuations, while including all agents in the JSON output.
