Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  62  32  35  52  28   3  99   7
1  60  59  99  32   9  82  36  36  54
2  99  27  16  78   7  87  66  49  24
3  38  33  37  94  94  42  36  19  21
4  53  39  57  30  97  42  56  87  34
5  66  84  99  29  77  27   2  34  76
6  11  65  75  18  89  80  12  40  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple strategy where each agent gets assigned items based on their highest valuations. We'll ensure that each agent gets a fair share of items and that all items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuation of items: [13, 62, 32, 35, 52, 28, 3, 99, 7]
   - Highest valued item: Item 7 (Value: 99)

2. **Agent 1**: Valuation of items: [60, 59, 99, 32, 9, 82, 36, 36, 54]
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (Value: 99)

3. **Agent 2**: Valuation of items: [99, 27, 16, 78, 7, 87, 66, 49, 24]
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (Value: 99)

4. **Agent 3**: Valuation of items: [38, 33, 37, 94, 94, 42, 36, 19, 21]
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 or Item 4 (Value: 94)

5. **Agent 4**: Valuation of items: [53, 39, 57, 30, 97, 42, 56, 87, 34]
   - Highest valued item: Item 4 (Value: 97)

6. **Agent 5**: Valuation of items: [66, 84, 99, 29, 77, 27, 2, 34, 76]
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (Value: 99)
   - Second highest valued item: Item 1 (Value: 84)

7. **Agent 6**: Valuation of items: [11, 65, 75, 18, 89, 80, 12, 40, 33]
   - Highest valued item: Item 4 (Value: 89)

Based on the above, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [1, 5, 8]
- Agent 6: [6]

This allocation is done in such a way that each agent gets items based on their highest valuations, ensuring a fair distribution.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 5, 8],
    "6": [6]
}
```
