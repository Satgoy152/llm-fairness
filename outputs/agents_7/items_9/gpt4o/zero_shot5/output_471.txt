Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  84  66  68  15  59  83  36  49
1  67  65  88  86  92  30  78   3  67
2  33  48  56  95  89  15  18  97   1
3  96  99  42  45  92  74  65  36  69
4   6  45  56  17  44  43  26  73  21
5  61  22  32  40  86  10  31  35  68
6  51  85  62  96   5  58  90   7  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will use a method to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. This can be approached as a modified version of the "assignment problem," where we prioritize allocations that maximize individual agent values for each item.

Given the constraints, here's a proposed allocation that attempts to balance the distribution:

1. Identify the highest valuations for each item across all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, making sure that each agent gets at least one item.

Let's allocate accordingly:

- Agent 0: Valuation of 83 for item 6.
- Agent 1: Valuation of 92 for item 4.
- Agent 2: Valuation of 97 for item 7.
- Agent 3: Valuation of 99 for item 1.
- Agent 4: Valuation of 56 for item 2.
- Agent 5: Valuation of 68 for item 8.
- Agent 6: Valuation of 96 for item 3 and 51 for item 0.

This allocation gives each agent at least 1 item while maximizing the total value based on the highest valuations per item.

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [0, 3]
}
```
