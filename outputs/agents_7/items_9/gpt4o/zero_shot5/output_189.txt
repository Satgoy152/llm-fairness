Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  92  77  69   8  77  14  39  64
1   2   2   8  42  28  83  34  80  82
2  78  83  23  83  81  36  13  91  26
3   8  97  11  59  65  76  22  61  98
4  27  82  63  98  55  15  84  80  19
5  94  33  97  21  58  25  29  27  46
6  72  43  38  78  11  62  47  66  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every item is allocated to one agent and that some agents may receive no items. Let's go through the process of allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is for Item 1 (value 92).  
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is for Item 5 (value 83).  
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is for Item 7 (value 91).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is for Item 8 (value 98).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is for Item 3 (value 98).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for Agent 5 is for Item 0 (value 94).
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value for Agent 6 is for Item 3 (value 78), but it is already allocated to Agent 4. The next highest value is for Item 0 (value 72), but it is already allocated to Agent 5. The next highest value is for Item 7 (value 66), but it is already allocated to Agent 2. The next highest is Item 5 (value 62), but it is already allocated to Agent 1. The next highest value is for Item 6 (value 47).

After the initial allocation based on highest values, we have allocated 7 items. We need to allocate 2 more items.

Revisiting unallocated items:
- **Item 2**: This can be allocated to any agent that hasn't reached their highest value yet. Let's allocate to Agent 5, who had no item assigned initially after Item 0 was taken.
- **Item 4**: This can be allocated to Agent 1, who hasn't reached their second-highest value yet.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item [1]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 4]
- Agent 2: Item [7]
- Agent 3: Item [8]
- Agent 4: Item [3]
- Agent 5: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 6: Item [6]

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 2],
    "6": [6]
}
```
