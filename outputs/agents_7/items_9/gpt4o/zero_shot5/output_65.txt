Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86   3  17  66  14  70  62   7  76
1  74  49  59  31  49   9  60  20  41
2  56  26  10  50  58  95  88  49  88
3  18  60  37  36  35  63  64  13  27
4  14  41  96  91  68  60  56  43   5
5  92  10  44  58  66  56  61  18  29
6  65   2  52  53  21  63  63  21  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and that all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation approach based on maximizing the value for each agent:

1. Assign each agent their highest-value item first, if possible.
2. Continue to allocate remaining items to agents who value them relatively high, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (value 86), so assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most, but it’s already assigned; they value item 2 next (value 59), so assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (value 95), so assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (value 60), so assign item 1 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most, but it’s already assigned; they value item 3 next (value 91), so assign item 3 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 0 the most, but it’s already assigned; they value item 4 next (value 66), so assign item 4 to agent 5.
- Agent 6 values item 0 the most, but it’s already assigned; they value item 8 next (value 67), so assign item 8 to agent 6.

Now, distribute the remaining items 6 and 7. Checking who values these items the most among unassigned options:

- Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 88, the highest among remaining options, so assign item 6 to agent 2.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it at 49, the highest among remaining options, so assign item 7 to agent 2.

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 6, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
