Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  58  12  80  55  76   0  51  39
1  68  24  27  74  23  93  22   6  73
2  12  29  88  94  79  46  73   4  59
3  33  10  52  19  43  12  62  65  64
4  78  30  63  89  64  15  83  35  99
5  69  49  35  44  16  76  77  37   6
6  48  72  63  11  83  20  20  24  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider a method that aims to maximize the total happiness of each agent based on their valuations. We will assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent and each agent gets at least one item where possible. 

Here's the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: [3, 5, 0] with values [80, 76, 60]
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: [5, 3, 8] with values [93, 74, 73]
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: [3, 2, 6] with values [94, 88, 73]
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: [6, 7, 8] with values [62, 65, 64]
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: [8, 3, 6] with values [99, 89, 83]
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest valuations: [0, 5, 6] with values [69, 76, 77]
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 5.

7. **Agent 6**:
   - Highest valuations: [4, 1, 8] with values [83, 72, 61]
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 6.

Now we have assigned 7 items, and need to ensure each agent gets at least one item. We will continue the assignment:

- Assign item 0 to the next highest agent with the highest remaining preference, Agent 5.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, who still has a high preference for it.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [0, 6],
    "6": [4]
}
```

Here, each agent gets at least one item, and all items are fairly allocated based on the agents' preferences.
