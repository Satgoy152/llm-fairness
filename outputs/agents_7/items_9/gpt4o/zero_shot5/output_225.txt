Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  84  68  48  29  10  34  27  33
1  48  76  48  82  62  48  53  31  84
2  93  67   3  45   3  76  71  21  74
3  72  31   4  55   7  36  81   2  33
4   1  53  17  82  11  48  70  30   5
5  43  34  40  30  41  58  79   7  21
6  27  60  95  65  80  59  18  19  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We can use a greedy approach to assign items based on the highest valuation for each item. This approach attempts to ensure that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0:**  
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 2 (93)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

2. **Item 1:**  
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 0 (84)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. **Item 2:**  
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 6 (95)
   - Allocate to Agent 6

4. **Item 3:**  
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 1 (82)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

5. **Item 4:**  
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 6 (80)
   - Allocate to Agent 6

6. **Item 5:**  
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 2 (76)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

7. **Item 6:**  
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 3 (81)
   - Allocate to Agent 3

8. **Item 7:**  
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 1 (31)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

9. **Item 8:**  
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 1 (84)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

After these allocations, each agent might not have an equal number of items, but this approach maximizes the valuation for each item.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 7, 8],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the agents based on maximizing individual valuations.
