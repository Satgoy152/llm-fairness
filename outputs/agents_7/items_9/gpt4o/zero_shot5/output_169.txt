Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  15  56  77  61  85  79  85  44
1  94  47  30  71   2  41  62  70  95
2  97  78  59  63  90  25  85  88  23
3  90  30  98  42  72  71  45  56  55
4  98  49   4  66   7  49  20  19  83
5  59  89  42  51   4  84  74  54  66
6  49  66  47  40  21  64  23  20  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives. Here's one way to approach it:

1. Determine the highest value each agent has for any item and assign that item to the agent.
2. Continue assigning the next highest available item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item until all items are assigned.

Following this approach, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 should get item 7 (value 85).
- Agent 1 should get item 8 (value 95).
- Agent 2 should get item 0 (value 97).
- Agent 3 should get item 2 (value 98).
- Agent 4 should get item 4 (value 7).
- Agent 5 should get item 5 (value 84).
- Agent 6 should get item 1 (value 66).

Since there are 9 items and only 7 agents, we need to assign the remaining items:

- Item 3 (highest remaining value 77 for agent 0) can be assigned to agent 0.
- Item 6 (second highest remaining value 85 for agent 2) can be assigned to agent 2.

Therefore, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, with each agent receiving items based on their valuations to maximize fairness.
