Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74   0  45  55   2  40  66  33  76
1  14   5  19  43  14  68  13  34  80
2  69  32   7  32  12  15  30  52  95
3  46   2  22  23  23  57  44  27   6
4  61  18  49  87  76  73  58  26  20
5   7  19  27  95  53  91  10   2  24
6  25  47  55  48   0  51  29  43  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives approximately the same total value based on their valuations. Below is a fair allocation of items to the agents:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 8 the most (76), followed by item 0 (74). Assign item 8 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 8 the most (80). Since item 8 is already allocated, the next highest valued item is 5 (68). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 8 the most (95). Since item 8 is already allocated, assign item 7 (52) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 5 the most (57). Since item 5 is already allocated, assign item 3 (23) to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 3 the most (87). Since item 3 is already allocated, assign item 4 (76) to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 3 the most (95). Since item 3 is already allocated, assign item 2 (27) to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: This agent values items 8 and 2 the most (71 and 55, respectively). Since item 8 is already allocated, assign item 2 (55) to Agent 6.

Now, assign the remaining items to balance the distribution:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest remaining value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 6 (next highest value for Agent 6).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (next highest value for Agent 3).

Now we have allocated all items. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [1]
}
```
