Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22   7  94  60  12  37  83   8  29
1  43  64   4  51  97  82  99  92  83
2  45  29  72  27  81  19  40  17  17
3  45  31  59  71  96  12  71  53  82
4  94  26  77  30  37  44  27  44  15
5  87  67  33  63  41  29  41  77   2
6  11  35  91  11  75  94  74  30  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can follow a strategy to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each agent gets an item they value highly, which can help achieve a fair distribution.

Let's go through each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it at 94, which is the highest.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 5 values it at 67, which is the highest.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 94, which is the highest.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it at 71, which is the highest.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 97, which is the highest.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 6 values it at 94, which is the highest.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 99, which is the highest.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it at 92, which is the highest.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 3 values it at 82, which is the highest.

Now, let's allocate these items to the agents accordingly:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [4, 6, 7]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [3, 8]
- Agent 4: [0]
- Agent 5: [1]
- Agent 6: [5]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 6, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [5]
}
```
