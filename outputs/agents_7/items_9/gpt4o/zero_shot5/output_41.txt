Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  74  27  76   5  88  42  36  86
1  52  66  43  55  80  63  29  51  26
2  11  16  70  52  74  11  27  38   8
3  75  35  68  31  14  10  90  76  96
4  66  91  87   4  19  55  42  81  95
5  40  39  67  26  25  86  85  21  60
6  57  74   1  65  19   6  52  56  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated. Since there are more agents than items, some agents will not receive any items. We'll try to allocate items to the agents who value them the most.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify Max Valuation per Item:** For each item, identify the agent who values it the most.
2. **Allocate Items:** Assign each item to the agent who has the highest valuation for it.
3. **Ensure Fair Distribution:** Since we have more agents than items, some agents will not receive any items, which is acceptable as long as every item is allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 83.
- **Item 1:** Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 91.
- **Item 2:** Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 87.
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 76.
- **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 80.
- **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 88.
- **Item 6:** Agent 3 values it the most with a value of 90.
- **Item 7:** Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 81.
- **Item 8:** Agent 3 values it the most with a value of 96.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6, 8],
    "4": [1, 2, 7],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are assigned, and each item is given to the agent who values it the most.
