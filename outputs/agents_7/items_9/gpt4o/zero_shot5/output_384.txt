Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  55  59  72  40  64   4  70  91
1  63  58  14  56  54  12  94  53  64
2  72  97   7  49  85  37  75  74   6
3  90  80  54  99   4  35   9  55  51
4  33  23   9  82   6  72  19  72   1
5  30  63  66  92   5  71  79  93  10
6   3  32   7  84  35  62  59  30  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we should aim to distribute the total value of items as evenly as possible among the agents. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives a similar total value of items. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent.
2. Sort the agents by their total valuation.
3. Allocate items one by one, starting with the agent who values the item most, and ensuring that the distribution of values remains as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 58 + 55 + 59 + 72 + 40 + 64 + 4 + 70 + 91 = 513
- Agent 1: 63 + 58 + 14 + 56 + 54 + 12 + 94 + 53 + 64 = 468
- Agent 2: 72 + 97 + 7 + 49 + 85 + 37 + 75 + 74 + 6 = 502
- Agent 3: 90 + 80 + 54 + 99 + 4 + 35 + 9 + 55 + 51 = 477
- Agent 4: 33 + 23 + 9 + 82 + 6 + 72 + 19 + 72 + 1 = 317
- Agent 5: 30 + 63 + 66 + 92 + 5 + 71 + 79 + 93 + 10 = 509
- Agent 6: 3 + 32 + 7 + 84 + 35 + 62 + 59 + 30 + 81 = 393

Now, let's allocate the items, aiming for balanced totals:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [2, 8]
}
```

Here's the breakdown:
- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 6.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 does not receive any items.
- Agent 5 gets item 7.
- Agent 6 gets items 2 and 8.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, except agent 4, which has the lowest total valuation. The items are distributed in a way that attempts to balance the total valuations across agents.
