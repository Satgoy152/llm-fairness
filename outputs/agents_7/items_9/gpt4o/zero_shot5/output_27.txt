Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  39  91  92   0  35  74  24  18
1  53  55  70  48  51   2  76  15  73
2  93  23  79  65  29  45  71  64  52
3  39  49  37  36  62  21  51  91  53
4  61  19  73  87  41  10  82  65  29
5  63  11  16  33  29  91  32  79  22
6  96  67  75  48  86  90  13  37  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we can employ a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. We will try to distribute the items based on the values each agent places on them. 

Given that there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. We'll assign the items to agents such that the overall satisfaction (in terms of valuations) is maximized.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Allocate item 3 to agent 0 (value 92).
2. Allocate item 2 to agent 1 (value 70).
3. Allocate item 0 to agent 2 (value 93).
4. Allocate item 7 to agent 3 (value 91).
5. Allocate item 6 to agent 4 (value 82).
6. Allocate item 5 to agent 5 (value 91).
7. Allocate item 8 to agent 6 (value 87).
8. Allocate item 1 to agent 6 (value 67).
9. Allocate item 4 to agent 6 (value 86).

This way, each agent gets at least one item, with agent 6 receiving three items due to high valuations.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [8, 1, 4]
}
```
