Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  45   1  57  52  92  40  34  38
1  45  82  26  14  89  12   4   6  58
2  83  14   9  16  93  30  94  74   0
3  25  84   3  65  38  54  34   5  19
4  96  70  62  71  98   7  59  44   2
5  43  52  58  55   6  24  74  49  65
6  63  82  76  41  59  61  58  22  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that maximizes the total utility (value) for each agent. One possible strategy is to assign items to the agents who value them the most until all items are distributed.

Steps:
1. For each item, find the agent that values it the most.
2. Assign that item to the agent.
3. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's go item by item and allocate them to the agents who value them the most:

- Item 0: Agent 4 (value 96)
- Item 1: Agent 3 (value 84)
- Item 2: Agent 6 (value 76)
- Item 3: Agent 4 (value 71)
- Item 4: Agent 4 (value 98)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (value 92)
- Item 6: Agent 2 (value 94)
- Item 7: Agent 2 (value 74)
- Item 8: Agent 1 (value 58)

With this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated based on the highest value each agent assigns to them. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 3, 4],
    "5": [],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item if possible. Agent 5 receives no items because other agents value the items more.
