Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  84  98  65  10   0  46   8  68
1  66  23  93  38  32  24  59  99  71
2  67  61  45  52   0   0  47   9  33
3  12   1  91  51  11  71  18  25  20
4  33  99  22  96  99  50  80  86  86
5  39  85  56  20  10  93  24  73  59
6  75  85  63  30  49  70  20  89  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll use the valuations provided in the table to ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. We'll look for a balanced distribution where each agent has a reasonable total value from their allocated items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 6 (value 75).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 4 (value 99).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 98).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 4 (value 96).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 4 (value 99).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 5 (value 93).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value 46).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 1 (value 99).
9. Assign item 8 to agent 2 (value 33).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 3, 4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
