Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56   3  58  83  49  77  44  70  65
1  98  81   6  47  13  54  49  95  23
2  97  28  86  50  53  68  74   4  62
3  11   5  34  47  63  10  77   0  62
4  45  82  85  97  77   3  60  72  67
5  90  31  20  99  32  85  83  11  84
6  93   3  82  55  36  22   7  80   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest value for each item across all agents.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, but balance the total allocation across agents.

Let's go through the items one by one:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 98 by Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 82 by Agent 4.
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 86 by Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 99 by Agent 5.
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 77 by Agent 4.
- **Item 5**: Highest value is 85 by Agent 5.
- **Item 6**: Highest value is 83 by Agent 5.
- **Item 7**: Highest value is 95 by Agent 1.
- **Item 8**: Highest value is 84 by Agent 5.

Agent 5 is receiving too many items. We need to distribute items more evenly:

- Assign Item 6 to Agent 3 (next highest value 77).
- Assign Item 8 to Agent 0 (next highest value 65).

Now we have:

- Agent 0: Item 8
- Agent 1: Items 0, 7
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Items 1, 4
- Agent 5: Items 3, 5
- Agent 6: No items

This distribution respects the condition of allocating 9 items in total. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [3, 5],
    "6": []
}
```
