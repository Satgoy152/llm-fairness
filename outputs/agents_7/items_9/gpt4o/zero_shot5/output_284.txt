Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  32  37  89  69  96  12  43  48
1  85  77  44  56  87  57  24  78  87
2  32  46  75  65  64  93   9  52  39
3  90  86  77  18  11  48  42  74  63
4  52  53  59  39  85  27  29  28  75
5   3  65  59  66  71  60  18  27  59
6  25  67  31  38  24  35  84  53  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. A common approach to achieve fairness is to maximize the minimum valuation each agent receives. This can be a complex problem, but we can attempt a heuristic solution here.

Let's distribute the items in a way that aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives. We will keep track of the total valuation each agent gets and allocate items one by one, trying to maintain fairness.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 5 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it highly at 93.
2. Assign item 0 to agent 3, as agent 3 values it highly at 90.
3. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it highly at 89.
4. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it highly at 87.
5. Assign item 8 to agent 6, as agent 6 values it highly at 85.
6. Assign item 1 to agent 5, as agent 5 values it at 65 and this helps balance the distribution.
7. Assign item 7 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it at 28 and this balances the allocation.
8. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it at 44 and this helps balance the distribution.
9. Assign item 6 to agent 6, as agent 6 values it at 84 and this helps balance the distribution.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [6, 8]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints, though it's not guaranteed to be perfectly fair in all aspects due to the complexity of the problem.
