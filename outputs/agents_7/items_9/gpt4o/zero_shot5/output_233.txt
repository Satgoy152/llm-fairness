Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  37  94  56  60  42  22  39  16
1  23  81  58  72  51  50  76  84  20
2  80   5   5  10  19  42  49  62  14
3  36  20   3  44  12  24  26  43  78
4  90   2  25  20  49  58  22  34  53
5  47  81  67  74   4   7  95   3  44
6  83  39  86   6  80  22   7  29  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach such as maximizing each agent's overall satisfaction by selecting items with the highest value for each agent. Given that there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but ideally, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most, so assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 the most, so assign item 7 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the most, so assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 8 the most, so assign item 8 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the most (already assigned), next highest is item 5.
6. Agent 5 values item 6 the most, so assign item 6 to agent 5.
7. Agent 6 values item 2 the most (already assigned), next highest is item 0, then item 4.

We need to continue assigning the remaining items to ensure all are allocated. Let's proceed:

- Give item 1 to agent 1 since it is highly valued by them after item 7.
- Give item 3 to agent 5 as it is their next highest value after item 6.

Revisiting the assignments:

- Agent 0 has item 2.
- Agent 1 has items 1 and 7.
- Agent 2 has item 0.
- Agent 3 has item 8.
- Agent 4 has item 5.
- Agent 5 has items 3 and 6.
- Agent 6 has item 4.

Now, let's format this into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3, 6],
    "6": [4]
}
```
