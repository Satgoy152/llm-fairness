Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  16  50  90  46  33  10   8  31
1  73  13  20  79  12  50  15  45  58
2  10  70  96  69  26  23  24  59  22
3  20  71  63  86   4  42  29  87  29
4  95  26  24  48  98   4  34  48   8
5  98  79  75   7  80  99  49  54  62
6  96   2  30  35  68  88  42  43  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most.
2. Distribute the remaining items to the agents with the least total valuation so far.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (98).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most, but since it's already taken, we'll assign them their next highest item, which is item 5 (50).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (96).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (86).
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most (98).
- Agent 5 values item 5 the most (99), but it's already taken, so we assign item 0 (98) since it's the next highest not yet assigned.
- Agent 6 values item 0 the most, but since it's already taken, we assign them their next highest, which is item 5 (88), but it's taken, so we assign them item 6 (42).

Now, all agents have at least one item. We have assigned 7 items so far, and 2 items remain (items 1 and 8). We'll allocate these based on the next highest values:

- Item 1 is best valued by Agent 3 (71), who only has one item, so we assign it to them.
- Item 8 is best valued by Agent 1 (58), and they have one item, so we assign it to them.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6]
}
```

Note: Agent 5 has been assigned item 0, but since it was already given to Agent 0, we should replace it with an unallocated item. Let's correct this:

Agent 5 gets item 7, which is unallocated and has a decent value for them (54):

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [6]
}
```
