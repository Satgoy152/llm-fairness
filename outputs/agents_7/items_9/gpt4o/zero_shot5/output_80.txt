Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  40  79   3   4  39  32  23  98
1  77   3  57  29  16  71  87  89  65
2  70  71  50  56  21  53   3  38  28
3  10  98  83  14  45  18  59  23  68
4  28  55  19  49  57   4  15  53   7
5  11   8  19  70  34  67  84  56   4
6  22  96  96  93   2  62  70  95   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 9 items and 7 agents, not every agent will receive an item, but we will attempt to allocate items to maximize value and maintain fairness.

Here's a proposed allocation:

1. Assign each of the highest valued items to different agents to ensure maximum valuation.
2. Distribute remaining items to agents to balance total valuations.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 8 the most with 98.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the most with 89.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most with 71.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most with 98, but it's already taken, so next highest is item 2 with 83.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most with 57.
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most with 70.
- Agent 6 values item 1 the most with 96, but it's already taken, so next highest is item 3 with 93.

After the first allocation pass, let's ensure each agent has at least one item:

1. Agent 0: Item 8
2. Agent 1: Item 7
3. Agent 2: Item 1
4. Agent 3: Item 2
5. Agent 4: Item 4
6. Agent 5: Item 3
7. Agent 6: Item 6 (since item 3 is already taken)

Now we have allocated 7 items, and we have 2 remaining items (0, 5) to allocate:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 to maximize their value.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 5 to increase their total valuation.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 5],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations as much as possible.
