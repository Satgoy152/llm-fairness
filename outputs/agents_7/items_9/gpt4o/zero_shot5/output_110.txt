Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  13  92  78  72  29  65  66  91
1  58  90  16  59  49  99  62  70  42
2  82  43  70  67  68  62  28   8  25
3  62  35  91  97  14   8  74  33  26
4  48  47  20  37  96  66  21   0  39
5  28  41  34  78  73  85   3  33  67
6  44  41  25  91  37  11  87  11   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to give each agent items that maximize their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated. Here's a possible fair allocation strategy based on the given table:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 the most (92). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 5 the most (99). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the most (82). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the most (97). Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 4 the most (96). Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 7 the most (33). Assign item 7 to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: Values item 6 the most (87). Assign item 6 to Agent 6.

At this point, each agent has been assigned one item except for Agent 5, who has the lowest highest valuation. Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 8:

8. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 (90) highly, and since Agent 1 has high valuation for it, assign item 1 to Agent 1.
9. **Agent 0**: Values item 8 the most (91) among remaining items, assign item 8 to Agent 0.

Thus, the allocation becomes fair and complete. Here's the final allocation JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [6]
}
```
