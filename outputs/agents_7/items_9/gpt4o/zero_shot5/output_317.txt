Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  53  83   7  36  11  62  32  46
1  80  21  35  37  40   2  27  26  36
2  42  49  15  41  88  27  60  83  63
3  52   5  70  33  33  74  54   1  59
4  81  18  25  16  67  15  55  47  68
5  22  38   7  84  31  67  11  35  75
6  66  86   7  22  94  58  77  59  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a distribution where each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent. Since there are 7 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive only one item or none.

Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: Looking at the valuations, agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 (83) and 0 (62). Assign item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest with a valuation of 80. Assign item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 places a high value on item 4, with a valuation of 88. Assign item 4 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 5, with a valuation of 74. Assign item 5 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 finds item 0 most valuable at 81, but since item 0 is already allocated, we consider the next highest, which is item 8, valued at 68. Assign item 8 to agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 3 highly at 84. Assign item 3 to agent 5.

7. **Agent 6**: Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 4 at 94, but it is already taken. The next highest is item 1, valued at 86. Assign item 1 to agent 6.

Now, we have allocated the items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8. We need to allocate the remaining items, 6 and 7, to the agents who might have lower total allocations.

8. **Allocate remaining items**:
    - Agent 0 is currently assigned only one item. Agent 0's next highest value for an unallocated item is 6 (62). Assign item 6 to agent 0.
    - Agent 4 received one item. Agent 4's next highest value for an unallocated item is 7 (47). Assign item 7 to agent 4.

Now, we have all 9 items allocated as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [8, 7],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and the distribution attempts to respect the highest valuations of the agents for the available items.
