Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  40  86  94   5   1  99  94  64
1  51  72  86  47  96  92  14  76  63
2  16  31   8  40  21  71  77  63  19
3  17   5  71  21  56   3  45  25  50
4  87  18  47  61  58  68  27  10  91
5  87  63  10   1  73  72  41  16  62
6  83  20  43  30  40  95  94  95  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring that all agents are treated as equally as possible in terms of their satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Get items with the highest valuation for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Get items with the highest valuation for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Get items with the highest valuation for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Get items with the highest valuation for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Get items with the highest valuation for Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Get items with the highest valuation for Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: Get items with the highest valuation for Agent 6.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on the highest value each agent has for an unallocated item.

- Agent 0: Item 6 (valuation: 99)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (valuation: 96)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (valuation: 71)
- Agent 3: Item 2 (valuation: 71)
- Agent 4: Item 8 (valuation: 91)
- Agent 5: Item 0 (valuation: 87)
- Agent 6: Item 7 (valuation: 95)

Now, allocate the remaining items (1 and 3) to the agents with the least total valuation from their allocations.

- Agent 0: Item 3 (valuation: 94)
- Agent 6: Item 1 (valuation: 20)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their respective satisfaction based on their highest preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [7, 1]
}
```
