Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78   7  71  92  11  69  92  30  19
1  18  14  56   3  47  16  10   6  32
2  88  60  27  42  46  72  87  81  12
3  25  89  39  58   4  29  54  68   4
4  11  93  91  34  10  58  78  19  36
5  79   3  55  80  80  36   5  44  12
6  63  26  97  10  51  48  35  60  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 9 items allocated in total. One potential approach to achieve fairness is to distribute the items based on each agent's highest valuations. Let's allocate the items in a way that attempts to maximize fairness based on the given valuations.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (92)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (56)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (88)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (89)
- Agent 4: Item 6 (78)
- Agent 5: Item 4 (80)
- Agent 6: Item 8 (73)

This leaves us with 2 more items to allocate (5, 7). We can assign them based on the next best available valuation for each agent:

- Agent 2: Item 5 (72)
- Agent 6: Item 7 (60)

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [8, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.
