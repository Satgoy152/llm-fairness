Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  95  68  18  91  76  43  90  82
1  12  19  82  46  97   5  69  67  22
2  58  25  80  33  47  85  65  30  47
3  78  70  44  59  40   7  89  59  11
4  33   0  65  34  83  16  77  65  75
5  98  71  67  86  83  25  49  86  53
6  15  32  68  93  35  71  48  34  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Here's a possible allocation of the items:

1. Start by identifying which agent values each item the most.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who has the highest valuation for it.
3. If any agent ends up with more than one item, and another agent has none, redistribute the items to ensure each agent gets at least one item.

Based on these steps, here is a possible allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 5 (value 98)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (value 95)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (value 82)
- Item 3: Agent 6 (value 93)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (value 97)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (value 85)
- Item 6: Agent 3 (value 89)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (value 90)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (value 82)

Now, let's ensure no agent is left without an item. After checking, it seems Agent 4 initially did not receive an item:

To adjust, we can reassign:
- Item 8 from Agent 0 to Agent 4, since Agent 4 values it at 75 which is still fairly high.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item while trying to maximize the total value each agent gets.
