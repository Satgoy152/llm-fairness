Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  53  41   6  86  88  67  67  19
1  30  32  20  79  44  35  65  95  53
2   6  44  55  19  40  47  28  83  84
3  13  13   2  41  91  33  27   3  55
4  12  89  35  29   4  62  20  53   1
5  96   4  23  54   5  39  41  93  45
6  80  61  31  82  14   4  81  36  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider distributing the items so that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Let's approach this by selecting the item for each agent where they have relatively higher valuations compared to others, aiming for a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 4 has a high valuation of 86.
2. **Agent 1**: Item 7 has the highest valuation of 95.
3. **Agent 2**: Item 8 has the highest valuation of 84.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 4 has a high valuation of 91, but it's already taken by agent 0. Next highest is item 3 with valuation 41.
5. **Agent 4**: Item 1 has the highest valuation of 89.
6. **Agent 5**: Item 0 has the highest valuation of 96.
7. **Agent 6**: Item 6 has the highest valuation of 81.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: Item 8
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Item 0
- Agent 6: Item 6

This allocation gives each agent one item, totaling 7 items. We need to distribute 2 more items.

For the remaining items 2 and 5:
- Agent 0 has a decent valuation for item 5 (88), and Agent 2 has a decent valuation for item 2 (55).

Revised allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: Items 8, 2
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Item 0
- Agent 6: Item 6

This results in a total allocation of 9 items.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [8, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6]
}
```
