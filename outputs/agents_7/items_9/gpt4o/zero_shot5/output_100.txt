Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  85   1  66  68   9  77  83  18
1  55  65  34  85  44  14  70  85  36
2  69  24  99  43  54  16  97  28  84
3  38  68  12  90  55  97  78  41  59
4  57  82  72  28  43  74  80  29  50
5  97  26  31  64  94  38  45   0  70
6  56  75  34  73  77  64  33   3  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [56 75 34 73 77 64 33  3 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed. Given the valuation table, one approach is to maximize the total value for each agent by assigning items according to their highest preferences, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0: Assign items 0 and 7. (60 + 83 = 143)
2. Agent 1: Assign items 3 and 6. (85 + 70 = 155)
3. Agent 2: Assign items 2 and 8. (99 + 84 = 183)
4. Agent 3: Assign item 5. (97)
5. Agent 4: Assign item 1. (82)
6. Agent 5: Assign item 4. (94)
7. Agent 6: Assign no items.

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4],
    "6": []
}
```
