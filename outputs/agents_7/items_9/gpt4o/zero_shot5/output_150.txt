Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  56   9   8  79  53  33  47   4
1  44  36  81  23  19  96  13  11  33
2  59   4  13  65  48  89  43  61  83
3  61  16  70   4  97  99  60  45  72
4  19  34  41  41  72  76  30  61  37
5  30  30  35  64  55  64  90  58  71
6  18   2  56  27  89  22  29  29  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here is one way to do this:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 8.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5, but since it is already taken, we allocate second-highest item 4.
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 5, but since it is already taken, we allocate second-highest item 4.
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 6.
7. Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 4, but since it is already taken, we allocate second-highest item 4.

After considering these allocations and resolving conflicts by looking for the next highest valuations that are unallocated, we can finalize the following assignment:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [8, 3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item where possible.
