Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  62  16  87  75   9  26  83  67
1  45  37   3  22  70  17  49  26  26
2  18  19  51  57  57  40   6  29  62
3  31  51  66  97  29  75  98  59  25
4  97  52  22  21  92  85   5  95  10
5  74  23  26  99  36  32  33  83  84
6  39  90   8  18  27  85  88  23  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring that all items are allocated to some agent. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 3 highly (87). Also values item 1 (62) and item 7 (83) significantly.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 highly (70). Other notable values are item 0 (45) and item 6 (49).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 8 (62). Other notable values are item 3 (57) and item 4 (57).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 very highly (97) and item 6 (98).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 0 (97) and item 7 (95) highly.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 3 very highly (99) and item 8 (84).
7. **Agent 6**: Values item 1 (90) and item 6 (88) highly.

Let's allocate the items considering these preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 7 (83)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4 (70)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 8 (62)
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 6 (98)
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 0 (97)
- **Agent 5**: Allocate item 3 (99)
- **Agent 6**: Allocate item 1 (90)
  
For the remaining items:

- Item 2 and item 5 are left. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (40), as Agent 2 has a higher valuation for item 5 compared to others who have already received high value items. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (3), as no other agent has a significant valuation for it and Agent 1 has received only one item so far.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [8, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [1]
}
```
