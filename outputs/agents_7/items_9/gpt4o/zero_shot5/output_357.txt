Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  62  44  27  42  62  91  13  63
1  78  15  27  57  67  32  79  63  62
2  63  85  71  63  43   5   2  30  98
3  53  73  17   3  96   1  53  66  63
4  66  35  90  63  43  28  85  55  18
5  87  82  44  22  57  86  49  38  57
6  88  66  92  68  17  38  81  26  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given there are 7 agents and 9 items, each agent will receive at least one item, and two agents will receive an additional item.

We'll employ a heuristic approach, attempting to allocate items to the agent who values them the most while ensuring all agents get at least one item.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 6 (91)
   - Allocation: [6]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (78)
   - Allocation: [0]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 8 (98)
   - Allocation: [8]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (96)
   - Allocation: [4]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (90)
   - Allocation: [2]

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (86)
   - Allocation: [5]

7. **Agent 6**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (92), but already allocated
   - Next highest valuation: Item 0 (88), but already allocated
   - Next highest valuation: Item 6 (81), but already allocated
   - Next highest valuation: Item 3 (68)
   - Allocation: [3]

Now, we have allocated 7 items, and 2 items remain to be allocated. We will distribute these remaining items to agents who still have high valuations for available items.

8. **Remaining Allocation**:
   - Item 1: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 2 (85)
   - Item 7: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 3 (66)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [8, 1],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total of 9 items are allocated.
