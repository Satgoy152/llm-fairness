Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97   6   3  71  61  62  91  16  84
1  56  70  75  71   4   7  60   4  70
2  42  90  67   5  87  39  80  97  23
3  81  70  47  33   8  71  40  30  30
4  69  39  71  54  69  11   2  87  39
5  12  53   8  53   4  31  19  23   2
6  75  32  60  58  96  38  98   9   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their total valuation. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we iteratively assign the highest valued available item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value 97).
2. Assign item 4 to agent 6 (value 96).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 97).
4. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value 90).
5. Assign item 6 to agent 6 (value 98).
6. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 75).
7. Assign item 8 to agent 0 (value 84).
8. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 71).
9. Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value 71).

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7, 1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [4, 6]
}
```
