Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  90  79  17  20  81   3  14  40
1  99  98   3  63  49  58   1  73  81
2  91  44  34   0  19  87  97  25   7
3  94  90  82  95  93  83  94  72  70
4  94  57  70  12  84  69  56  13  69
5  57  54  77  68  62  51  98  11  49
6  75  96  28  76  37  84  12  29  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total valuations are balanced to the extent possible. There are 7 agents and 9 items to distribute, meaning some agents will receive more items than others.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 8.
- Agent 2 receives items 6 and 5.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.
- Agent 4 receives item 4.
- Agent 5 receives item 2.
- Agent 6 receives item 7.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each gets an integer number of items.

{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [7]
}
```
