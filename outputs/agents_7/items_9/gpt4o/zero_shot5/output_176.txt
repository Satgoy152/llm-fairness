Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  87  15  93  75  68  59  45  47
1  69  96   9  64  52  60  60  59  45
2  26  33  56  45  81  57  77  59  92
3  59  45  69  46  26  85  53  38  46
4  24  59   4   7  82  62  46  63  19
5  22   2  97  87  86  93  30  86  98
6   0  66  89  92  49  73  29   0  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a balanced number of items based on their preferences. The goal is to allocate all 9 items across the 7 agents. Here's one possible fair allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent the items they value the most, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and the total number of allocated items is 9.

Based on the given table, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 8 the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the highest.
- Agent 5 values item 7 the highest.
- Agent 6 values item 6 the highest.
- Additional items are distributed to maximize fairness and balance.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [6, 2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and respects the highest valuations of the agents for individual items. Agent 6 receives additional items to ensure all items are allocated.
