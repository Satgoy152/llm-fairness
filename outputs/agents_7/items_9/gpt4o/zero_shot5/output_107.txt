Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  25  41  44  10  54  68  69  31
1  46  74  33  61  48  48   1  18  15
2  23  92  95  87  40  15  15  75   9
3  95  85  64  10  43   9  76  10  48
4  53  51  98  85  98  93  47  12  89
5  33  68  98  57  59  39   0  16  79
6  81  95  97  61  95  53  69  12  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for a strategy that maximizes the overall value each agent gets while ensuring every agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued item for agent 0 is item 6 (value 68). Allocate item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued item for agent 1 is item 1 (value 74). Allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued item for agent 2 is item 2 (value 95). Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valued item for agent 3 is item 0 (value 95). Allocate item 0 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valued item for agent 4 is item 2 (value 98), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 4 (value 98). Allocate item 4 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest valued item for agent 5 is item 2 (value 98), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 8 (value 79). Allocate item 8 to agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: The highest valued item for agent 6 is item 2 (value 97), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 1 (value 95), but it's also allocated. The next highest is item 4 (value 95), but it's allocated. The next highest is item 8 (value 94), but it's allocated. The next highest is item 0 (value 81). Allocate item 0 to agent 6 (but it's already allocated, so we need to check again). Allocate item 3 to agent 6.

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated:

- Items allocated so far: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8.
- Remaining items: 5, 7.

Let's allocate the remaining items:

8. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 5 to agent 0 (since agent 0 values both items 5 and 7 equally at 54 and 69 respectively, but item 5 is unallocated).
9. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 7 to agent 1 (since item 7 is unallocated and agent 1 values it at 18).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [3]
}
```
