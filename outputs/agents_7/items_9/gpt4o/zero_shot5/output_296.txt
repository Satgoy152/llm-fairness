Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  98  55  73  42   4  55  60  40
1  76  81  54  40   4  62  13  75  75
2  38  28  42  94  47  24  55   8   9
3  47  69  18  38   5  64  58  65  96
4  31  43  89  73  35  28  35  74  28
5  33  31  97  98  47  70  37  98  34
6  86  25  84  39  68  66  13  83   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we can use a simple approach where each agent gets at least one item, and we allocate based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 1 and 3. We can allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 0. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has a high valuation for item 8. Allocate item 8 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation is for item 2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest valuation is for item 7. Allocate item 7 to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: Has a high valuation for item 4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 6.

Now, only items 5 and 6 remain unallocated. We can assign them based on the next highest valuations:

- **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 5, who has a strong valuation for this item.
- **Item 6**: Allocate to Agent 3, as it has a high valuation for this item.

This leads to the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [8, 6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [7, 5],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, all items are allocated, and the allocation is based on maximizing valuations where possible.
