Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  63  83  60  73  78  32  31  22
1  42  80  95  59  59  91  77  13  65
2  76  91  65  41  78  90  45  58  84
3  49  80  28  25   6  38  45   5  95
4   6   8  26  82  39  88  59  12  89
5  61  99  40  87  79  92  20  58  48
6  50  11   6  60  40  77  57  13  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common approach is to iteratively assign the highest-valued available item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most at 76. Assign to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 5 values it the most at 99. Assign to Agent 5.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most at 95. Assign to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 5 values it the most at 87. Assign to Agent 5.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 5 values it the most at 79. Assign to Agent 5.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 5 values it the most at 92. Assign to Agent 5.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most at 77. Assign to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it the most at 58. Assign to Agent 2.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 3 values it the most at 95. Assign to Agent 3.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 3, 4, 5],
    "6": []
}
```
