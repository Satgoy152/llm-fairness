Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  15  94  65  61  92  12  40  21
1  31  67  62  99  62  45  25  33  99
2  31  16  39   0  86  88  21  43  41
3  51  77   3  70  31  27  30  97  49
4  97  12  36  73  15  65  50  63   5
5  38  46  32  21  13  27  50  50  29
6  87  88  90  41  13  72  48   3  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets at least one item (where possible), while trying to maximize the value each agent receives. This is a simplified approach to fair division, aiming to distribute items based on their perceived value to different agents.

Let's consider allocating items based on the highest value for each item:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 97 by Agent 4.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 88 by Agent 6.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 94 by Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 99 by Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 86 by Agent 2.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 92 by Agent 0 (already has an item, next highest is 88 by Agent 2).
7. Item 6: Highest value is 50 by Agent 4 (already has an item, next highest is 50 by Agent 5).
8. Item 7: Highest value is 97 by Agent 3.
9. Item 8: Highest value is 99 by Agent 1 (already has an item, next highest is 49 by Agent 3).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: Item 0
- Agent 5: Item 6
- Agent 6: Item 1
- Remaining items: 5, 8

Balancing the allocation, considering the remaining items:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 8

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [1]
}
```
