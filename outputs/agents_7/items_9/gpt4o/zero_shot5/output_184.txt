Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  56  84  56  59  38  29  22  20
1  41  47  79  44  84  40  69  83  37
2  84  38  89  34  39  22  16  57  79
3   4  41  79  35  30  25  87  35  20
4  78  15  60  46  49  10   1  56   9
5   9  77  36  87  11  26   1  51  65
6  77  54  15  50  63  72  21   8  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 highly (84).
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly (84).
3. Agent 2 values item 2 highly (89), but it's already taken by agent 0, so consider item 8 (79).
4. Agent 3 values item 6 highly (87).
5. Agent 4 doesn't have any standout high values, so we allocate items that are left.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 highly (87).
7. Agent 6 values item 8 highly (93), but it's already taken by agent 2, so consider item 5 (72).

Considering the above points, here's a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [0, 1, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their highest valuations, and all items are allocated.
