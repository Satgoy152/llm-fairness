Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  93  75  82  93  76  16   7  38
1  46   0   1  56  47  51   5  40  88
2  41  61  90  96  34   3  24  26  17
3  78  61  40  70  49  30  87  96  48
4  28  70  46  63  56  32  11  73  49
5  76  62  94  25  71  38  48  86  57
6  87  48   9  53  50  58  14  81  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute them such that each agent gets items they value highly while ensuring all items are distributed.

To achieve a fair allocation, I will use a greedy approach by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets a fair number of items if possible.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 6 (value 87).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value 93).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 5 (value 94).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2 (value 96).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 93).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 6 (value 58).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value 87).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 3 (value 96).
9. Assign item 8 to agent 1 (value 88).

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and every agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0, 5]
}
```
