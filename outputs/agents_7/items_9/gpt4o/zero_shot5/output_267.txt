Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  93  66  71  78  88  90  47  70
1  62  40  17  42   5  79  48   5  92
2  45  96  82  22  70  67   8  59  34
3  10  88  83  36   2  12  38  56  78
4  64  60  26   3  14  31  50  78  69
5  88  22  40  52  70  47  66  70  12
6  66  17  36  88  63  70  35  26  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring everyone gets at least one item, if possible. Here's one way to achieve a fair distribution:

1. Analyze each agent's highest-value items and try to allocate them to maximize individual satisfaction.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated, and no agent is left without any items.

After analyzing the table, here is a suggested allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 6
- Agent 1: Items 8 and 5
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 7
- Agent 5: Item 0
- Agent 6: Item 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [8, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [4]
}
```
