Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99   0   3   6  15  86  93  80  40
1  58  97  83  68  37  37  48  25  64
2  43  54  64  87  54  96  99   0  97
3  95  29  45  66  28  40  11  97  45
4  12  24  46  32   4   8  95  54   9
5  72  64  54  40  76  85   8  80  50
6  37  54  25  81  23  72  14  62  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing the overall satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation based on maximizing the sum of valuations:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0 and item 6.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1 and item 2.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5 and item 8.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 7.
5. Agent 4 and Agent 5 can receive items with lower competition or lower overall valuation impact.
6. Agent 6 can be considered for any remaining item balancing needs.

Following this approach, here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 6]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [5, 8]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [4]
- Agent 6: []

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 7 agents.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4],
    "6": []
}
```
