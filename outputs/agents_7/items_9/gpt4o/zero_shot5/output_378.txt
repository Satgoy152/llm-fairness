Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  89  47  72  74  75  15  16  94
1  60  83  80  10  42  53  76   8  24
2  37  53  71  93   9  88  13  53  71
3  42  21  69  31   8  14  90  32  50
4  22   8  35  31   2   0  60  45  92
5  74  31  46  84  62  74   5  46  25
6   7  20  37  67   2  20  47  88  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can aim to distribute the items based on maximizing the total valuation each agent has for their allocated items. We can use a simple heuristic where we allocate each item to the agent who values it the highest and ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Allocate the item to that agent.
3. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 5 values it the most (74).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (89).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (80).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (93).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (74).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (88).
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most (90).
- Item 7: Agent 6 values it the most (88).
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it the most (94).

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0 has items [1, 4, 8].
- Agent 1 has item [2].
- Agent 2 has items [3, 5].
- Agent 3 has item [6].
- Agent 4 has no items.
- Agent 5 has item [0].
- Agent 6 has item [7].

Agent 4 doesn't have any items. We'll need to adjust to ensure fairness. Let's reassign item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 4, as Agent 0 has multiple items.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 9.
