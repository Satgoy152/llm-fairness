Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  25  89  34  63  99  22  94  59
1  88  25  44  71  37  20  27  72  28
2  67  66  41  60  76  70  11  63  71
3  76  55  38  42  91   9  70  58  53
4  85  29  35  24  26  96  99  65  12
5  89   5  10  53  50  36   5  87  36
6  38  36  44  69  75  12  55  35  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 7 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more than one item, but the goal is to distribute them as equitably as possible based on the agents' valuations.

Let's consider the valuations and allocate items accordingly:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent first, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Allocate remaining items to agents based on their next highest valuations, ensuring a fair distribution.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (value 99)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (value 88)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (value 76)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (value 70)
- Agent 4: Item 6 (value 99)
- Agent 5: Item 0 (value 89)
- Agent 6: Item 4 (value 75)

Since some items are allocated to more than one agent and some are missed, let's adjust the allocation to ensure uniqueness:

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (value 99)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (value 88)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (value 76)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (value 42)
- Agent 4: Item 6 (value 99)
- Agent 5: Item 7 (value 87)
- Agent 6: Item 1 (value 36)

Now, let's distribute the remaining items (2 and 8) among the agents based on their next highest valuations:

- Agent 2: Item 2 (value 41)
- Agent 1: Item 8 (value 28)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, with some agents receiving more than one item, but keeping the distribution as fair as possible based on the initial valuations.
