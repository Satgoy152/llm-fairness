Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  70  95  90  41  68  45   1  46
1  67  79  79  31  66  13  64  96   7
2  80  69  73  37  15  23  70  76  16
3  52  75  53  21  23  61  79  75  49
4  57  56   5  32  42  80  82  67  62
5  73  53  59  64  90  25  76  14  84
6  24  25  46  70  32  54  57  92  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll do this by considering each agent's preference for the items and ensuring each agent gets at least one item, given there are 9 items and 7 agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 2 (95). Allocate item 2.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 7 (96). Allocate item 7.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 0 (80). Allocate item 0.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 6 (79). Allocate item 6.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 6 (82), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 5 (80). Allocate item 5.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value is for item 4 (90). Allocate item 4.
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value is for item 7 (92), but it's taken. Next highest value is for item 8 (81). Allocate item 8.

Now we have allocated 7 items, and 2 items remain. We'll allocate these remaining items to balance the number of items per agent.

8. **Agent 0** already has 1 item. Allocate item 3 (90) as it's the next highest value for Agent 0.
9. **Agent 3** already has 1 item. Allocate item 1 (75) as it's the next highest value for Agent 3.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6, 1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [8]
}
```
