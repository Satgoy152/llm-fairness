Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  40  78   8  87  95  32  15  45
1  36  99  30  32  90  53  96   0  30
2  75  88  76  55  92  57  60  63  78
3  99  70  84  68  56  87  51  10  35
4  64  27  52  89  61  95  15  94  56
5  35  31  40  41  33  66  26  36  24
6  68  43  78  45  58  40  87  21  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Agent 0's highest-valued items are 0, 4, and 5.
2. Agent 1's highest-valued items are 1, 6, and 4.
3. Agent 2's highest-valued items are 1, 4, and 8.
4. Agent 3's highest-valued items are 0, 2, and 5.
5. Agent 4's highest-valued items are 3, 5, and 7.
6. Agent 5's highest-valued items are 5, 3, and 4.
7. Agent 6's highest-valued items are 6, 0, and 2.

Considering these valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 0
- Agent 1 gets item 1
- Agent 2 gets item 8
- Agent 3 gets item 2
- Agent 4 gets item 3
- Agent 5 gets item 5
- Agent 6 gets items 4 and 6
- Item 7 is not claimed by any agent as their highest value, we need to allocate it to the agent with the least allocation and reasonable valuation, which would be Agent 4.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4, 6]
}
```
This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the 7 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, except agent 4 who gets two.
