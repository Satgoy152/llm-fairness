Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  10  55  79  72  52  55  97  31
1  14  72  60  49   7  42   3  98  31
2  82  34  44  50  24  23  24   4  89
3   4  81  54  10  11  36  93  49  91
4  13  39  91  40  76  54  11   3  78
5  26  13  64  49  17  61  44  38  80
6  92   9  43  69   7  93  23  66  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items, aiming to maximize total happiness or utility. However, given the constraint that each agent gets an integer number of items and only 9 items are available, we need to ensure that all items are allocated without violating these conditions.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. 

Following this approach, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 7.
- Agent 1 has high valuation for item 7.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 8.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 1 and 6.
- Agent 4 has high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 5 has high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 6 has high valuation for item 4.

Adjusting to ensure all 9 items are allocated:

- Allocate item 3 and 7 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- Allocate items 1 and 6 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 5.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 6.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, aiming for a fair distribution based on valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4]
}
```
