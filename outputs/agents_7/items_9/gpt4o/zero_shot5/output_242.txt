Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  55  11  30   7  28  91  95  99
1  44  71  85  62  61  16  94   5  11
2   9  46  16  26  97  82  85   3  22
3  60  91  91  58  23  46  23  12  15
4  56  51  58  99  68  28  48  24  11
5  10  55  89  41  43  61  66  68   8
6  49  70  68  82  31  48  96  57  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value based on their preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent the item which they value the highest, provided no other higher-ranked agent values it more.
2. Resolve conflicts by assigning the item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Continue until all items are allocated.

**Allocation Strategy:**

- Agent 0: Values item 8 the most (value 99)
- Agent 1: Values item 2 the most (value 85)
- Agent 2: Values item 4 the most (value 97)
- Agent 3: Values item 1 the most (value 91)
- Agent 4: Values item 3 the most (value 99)
- Agent 5: Values item 2 the most, but item 2 is already taken by Agent 1. Next highest is item 5 (value 61)
- Agent 6: Values item 6 the most (value 96)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items to ensure all 9 items are distributed:

- Items 0 and 7 are left unallocated. We assign them based on the next highest valuations:

  - Item 0:
    - Agent 3 has the highest value for item 0 (value 60)
  - Item 7:
    - Agent 0 has the highest value for item 7 (value 95)

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [8, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is distributed based on the agents' highest preferences, and all items are allocated.
