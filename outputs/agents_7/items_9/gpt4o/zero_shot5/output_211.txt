Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75   1  71   3  88  63  16  19  42
1  42   6  53  88  77   0  84  72  97
2  48  38  49  11  64  21   0  63  16
3   6  68  63  51  81   7  96  96  89
4   9  74  42  19  75   6  37   9  57
5  88  94  83  13  85  94  69  30  70
6  70  86  26  30  74  62  80   3  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent's valuation is considered while distributing the items. We aim to maximize the agents' satisfaction by assigning them items they value highly, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

Here's a fair allocation of the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 highly (88).
2. **Agent 1** values item 8 highly (97).
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 highly (38).
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 highly (96).
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 highly (19).
6. **Agent 5** values item 5 highly (94).
7. **Agent 6** values item 0 highly (70).

This leaves items 2 and 7 unallocated. We can allocate these to agents based on their remaining high valuations:

- **Agent 5** can also get item 2 (83), as they value it relatively high.
- **Agent 3** can also get item 7 (96), as they also value it highly.

The allocations can be presented in the requested JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5, 2],
    "6": [0]
}
```
