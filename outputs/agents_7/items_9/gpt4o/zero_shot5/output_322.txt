Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  61  34  73  31  47  89   4  35
1  72  34  36  68  56  24  59  76  51
2  30  88  53  70  49  68  86  19   0
3  39   5  49  94  13  82  22  94  84
4  22  27  12  97  90  86  75  74  93
5  60   3  76  18  53  60  23  12  43
6  49  32  19  63  21  84  51  62  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are distributed. A common approach is to maximize the total valuation of the items assigned to each agent. However, considering fairness, we will attempt to balance the allocation based on the given values.

Let's proceed with assigning items based on the highest valuations each agent has for the items, while ensuring fairness in distribution:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 6.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3.
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 4.
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 2.
7. Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 5.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (7 and 8) to ensure all 9 items are distributed. We will consider agents' second highest valuations for these items:

- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 7.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 8.

Thus, the allocations would look as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4, 8],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item based on their valuations, and all 9 items are distributed.
