Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  45  67  13  30   2  89  22  53
1  43  30  68  62  73  78   0  37  96
2  51  27  56  90  34  32  32  84  67
3  31  35  83   3  53  71  81  27  39
4  10  36  29  79   4  66  98  61  13
5  94  33  76  17  40  97  18  45  41
6  13  36  57  15  29  44  28  99  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach that considers each agent's valuation for the items and ensures that each agent gets at least one item, given there are 9 items and 7 agents. This approach will aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets the item they value the most available at the time of allocation.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initialize** each agent with an empty list for allocations.
2. **Iterate** over each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for it, if that agent has not yet received any items.
3. Once each agent has at least one item, continue assigning remaining items to the agent with the highest valuation for them among the agents who do not have the maximum number of items.

Following this procedure, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5, 0],
    "6": [1, 4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 6, as they value it the most compared to other items.
- Agent 1 receives item 8 for the highest value.
- Agent 2 receives item 3 for the highest value.
- Agent 3 receives item 2 for the highest value.
- Agent 4 receives item 7 for the highest value.
- Agent 5 receives items 5 and 0 because they have high values for them and fewer items left to allocate.
- Agent 6 receives items 1 and 4, ensuring all items are allocated fairly.

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated while considering valuations.
