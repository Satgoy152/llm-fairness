Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  96   8   9   3  77  99  43  54
1  24  77  70  25  79  20  93  40  78
2  25  19  42  65  13  42  42  44  98
3  52  57  89  22  42  68  37  44  95
4  23  87  66  91  92  84  47  32  48
5  31  91  60  90  93  51  53  83  22
6  63  83  77  27  17  38  87  19  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 9 items allocated. One possible approach is to assign the items to the agents based on their highest valuations. Here is one way to achieve this:

1. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust the allocations if necessary to ensure that all items are distributed.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 6 (value 63)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (value 96)
- Item 2: Agent 3 (value 89)
- Item 3: Agent 4 (value 91)
- Item 4: Agent 5 (value 93)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (value 77)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (value 93)
- Item 7: Agent 5 (value 83)
- Item 8: Agent 2 (value 98)

Now, let's represent the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4, 7],
    "6": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
