Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  38  62  36  41  59  36  58  29
1  87  22  99  29  20  76  24  86  55
2  50  35  23  53  11  79  73  95  53
3  81   8  44  31  80   6  90  19  82
4   0   1  96  78  10  57  48  67  89
5  55  70  10  48  77  19  99  65  41
6  48   1  95  71  22  39  92  37  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a proposed allocation plan:

### Allocation Plan:
1. **Agent 0**: Values items moderately across the board. Let's give Agent 0 one item that they value relatively well.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 2 (99) and has a good valuation for item 5 (76).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 7 (95) the highest, so this should be allocated to them.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 (90) the highest.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 (96) the highest but since item 2 is allocated to Agent 1, we look at another option such as item 8 (89).
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 6 (99) the highest, but since item 6 is allocated to Agent 3, we choose another high-value item such as item 4 (77).
7. **Agent 6**: Values item 6 (92) and item 2 (95) the highest. Since these are already allocated, we consider item 3 (71).

### Allocations:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [7]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [8]
- Agent 5: [4]
- Agent 6: [1, 3]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated, taking into consideration each agent's preferences to the best extent possible.
