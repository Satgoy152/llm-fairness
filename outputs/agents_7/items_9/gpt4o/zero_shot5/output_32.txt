Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95   5  72  84  85  53  56  20  68
1  78   2  22  58  64  28  44  69  38
2   1   8  52  57  23  91  92   0  56
3  54  77  57  57  41  68  12  96  63
4  46   4  42  69  83  95  24  12  11
5  57  27  21  99  15  92  13  13  81
6  48   0  50  56  62  45  43  49  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. A common approach is to assign items based on the highest value an agent assigns to an unallocated item.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. First, identify the highest value for each item across all agents and assign the item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Repeat this process until all items are allocated.

Following this approach, we can derive the following allocations:

- Item 0 is valued highest by agent 0 (value: 95).
- Item 1 is valued highest by agent 3 (value: 77).
- Item 2 is valued highest by agent 0 (value: 72).
- Item 3 is valued highest by agent 5 (value: 99).
- Item 4 is valued highest by agent 0 (value: 85).
- Item 5 is valued highest by agent 4 (value: 95).
- Item 6 is valued highest by agent 2 (value: 92).
- Item 7 is valued highest by agent 3 (value: 96).
- Item 8 is valued highest by agent 5 (value: 81).

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocations look:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3, 8],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents based on their valuations.
