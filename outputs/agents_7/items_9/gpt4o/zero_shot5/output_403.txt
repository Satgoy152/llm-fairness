Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  91  61  75  45  57  62  15  13
1  77  94  81  60  85  18  33   8  28
2  17  71  78  40  34  59  38  54  83
3  80  79  88  59  64  66  86  91  81
4  50   5  17  59  65  37  58  53  40
5  58  81  32  62   6  70  35  73  35
6   9   9  54  24  38  26  13   6  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed. A potential strategy for fairness could involve allocating items based on maximizing total value per agent or considering a balanced distribution strategy to ensure every agent has a fair share of high-value items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: Items [1, 6] - Total value: 91 + 62 = 153
2. Agent 1: Items [0, 4] - Total value: 77 + 85 = 162
3. Agent 2: Items [2, 8] - Total value: 78 + 83 = 161
4. Agent 3: Items [7] - Total value: 91
5. Agent 4: Items [3] - Total value: 59
6. Agent 5: Items [5] - Total value: 70
7. Agent 6: Items [] - Total value: 0

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item (except agent 6, which receives none due to limited items), and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": []
}
```
