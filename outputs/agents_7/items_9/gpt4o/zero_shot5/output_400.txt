Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  55  69  16  34  89  36  16  19
1  43  49  79  35  41  68  48  23  36
2  76  76  13  57  50  94  41  51  59
3  67   5  41  96  60  28  61  30  74
4  16  73  12  88  96   7  29  30  47
5   9  93   4  43  97  35   1  63  73
6  53  73  11  18  47  72  74  50  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, let's aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. We'll try to distribute the items in a way that is equitable, ensuring each agent receives at least one item when possible, and minimizing the potential valuation loss for any agent.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 highly (89), so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 highly (79), so allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 highly (94), but it's already taken; so allocate item 0 (76) to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 highly (96), so allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 highly (96), so allocate item 4 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 1 highly (93), so allocate item 1 to agent 5.
7. Agent 6 values item 6 highly (74), so allocate item 6 to agent 6.
8. Agent 2 has item 0, so allocate another high-value item for balance; item 8 (59) is a good choice.
9. Agent 0 has item 5, so allocate another high-value item; item 7 (16) is a good choice.

Now, we can assign the remaining items to ensure a more balanced distribution. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuation.
