Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  26  54  40  93  74  75  54   7
1  98  18  40  48  24   5  20  51  57
2  93  22  35   4  85  34  62  62   6
3  58  16  18  83  64  86   1  51  64
4  92  69  91  88  97   9  72  35   8
5  57  64  36  73   3  79   8  42  91
6  46  68   9  50  93  32   6   8   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we strive to distribute the total valuation as evenly as possible among all agents. We will use a greedy approach where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. List all items with their respective valuations for each agent.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure fair distribution by checking that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 1 (98)
2. **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 4 (69)
3. **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 0 (54)
4. **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 3 (83)
5. **Item 4**: Highest value by Agent 4 (97)
6. **Item 5**: Highest value by Agent 3 (86)
7. **Item 6**: Highest value by Agent 0 (75)
8. **Item 7**: Highest value by Agent 0 (54)
9. **Item 8**: Highest value by Agent 5 (91)

Now, let's ensure that each agent has at least one item, if possible, and reallocate if necessary:

- Agent 0: Already has Item 2, 6, 7
- Agent 1: Already has Item 0
- Agent 2: No items assigned, thus assign Item 8 to Agent 2 (since Agent 5 has two items)
- Agent 3: Already has Item 3, 5
- Agent 4: Already has Item 1, 4
- Agent 5: Give Item 8 to Agent 2
- Agent 6: No items assigned, thus Item 8 cannot be reassigned.

Since Agent 6 cannot be assigned an item without reassigning from another, we will leave them with no item:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on valuation, with some agents receiving more items due to higher valuations for those items.
