Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  71  16  77  75  66  63  55   6
1  28  86  69  10  58  44  41  29  33
2  50  23  18  69  36  75  17  84  60
3  92  44   3  58  76  93  74  30   5
4  34  78  31  29  43  15  85  46  22
5  71  11   2  17   8  69  32  68  41
6  20  90  83  28  13   1  48  66  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one can consider several methods such as maximizing the total valuation for each agent or ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, based on their preferences. Given that there are 7 agents and 9 items, a fair distribution could involve each agent getting at least one item, with two agents receiving two items each.

Here is one possible allocation, balancing the distribution and considering the valuations provided:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3. Let's allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 highly, so let's allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 highly, so let's allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest, but since it's already taken, we'll allocate item 6, which is the next highest for Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 highly, but since it's already taken, let's allocate item 4, which is their next highest.
6. Agent 5 values item 5, but since it's taken, we'll allocate item 7, which is the next highest for Agent 5.
7. Agent 6 values item 2 highly, so let's allocate item 2 to Agent 6.
8. The remaining item is 8, which can be allocated to Agent 4 since Agent 4 had fewer items than some others.

This allocation ensures all agents are considered and all items are allocated while attempting to respect their preferences as much as possible.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 8],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [2]
}
```
