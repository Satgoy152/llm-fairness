Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  65  36  37   3  70  28  91   6
1  88  85  34  77  15  74  84  22  93
2  24  73  49  14  79  17  82  39  27
3  68  69  70   8   1  98  71  94  68
4  67  35  23  85   0  72  24   2   0
5  68  18  10  76  45  59  33   8   9
6  51  86  57  43  26  82  46  13  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we can use a round-robin or similar strategy to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations. Considering there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. We'll prioritize giving higher valued items to agents that value them more.

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items fairly based on the valuations:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Since there are more items than agents, some agents will receive two items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0 is most valued by Agent 1 (88).
- Item 1 is most valued by Agent 6 (86).
- Item 2 is most valued by Agent 3 (70).
- Item 3 is most valued by Agent 1 (77).
- Item 4 is most valued by Agent 2 (79).
- Item 5 is most valued by Agent 3 (98).
- Item 6 is most valued by Agent 1 (84).
- Item 7 is most valued by Agent 3 (94).
- Item 8 is most valued by Agent 1 (93).

Now, ensure each agent receives at least one item where possible and distribute the remaining items fairly:

1. Agent 0: No items received yet.
2. Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 6, 8.
3. Agent 2: Item 4.
4. Agent 3: Items 2, 5, 7.
5. Agent 4: No items received yet.
6. Agent 5: No items received yet.
7. Agent 6: Item 1.

Given this distribution, some agents have not received any items, so let's ensure each agent receives at least one item:

Re-distribute some items for fairness:
- Reassign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Reassign Item 4 to Agent 4.
- Reassign Item 2 to Agent 5.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 6, 8],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
