Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  37  75  61   0  50  68  57   6
1  85  89  90  76  69  24   8  85  46
2  26  66  20  56  83  62  91  55  95
3  51  24   4  10  34  53  56  18  98
4  91  84  23  77  79  84   4  16  57
5  69  72  74  73  18   4  75  25  48
6  44  40  34  55  42  38  76  65  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an appropriate number of items based on their valuations. A common approach is to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction or valuation is maximized, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the allocation while considering the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations are for items 2 (75) and 6 (68).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuations are for items 2 (90) and 1 (89).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuations are for items 8 (95) and 6 (91).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation is for item 8 (98).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuations are for items 0 (91) and 5 (84).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest valuation is for item 6 (75).
7. **Agent 6**: The highest valuation is for item 8 (83).

To allocate the items, we can attempt to give each agent at least one of the items they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [2] (Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 0)
- Agent 1: [1] (Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 1)
- Agent 2: [8] (Item 8 is highly valued by Agent 2)
- Agent 3: [3] (Item 3 is a reasonable value for Agent 3, as item 8 is already allocated)
- Agent 4: [0, 4] (Items 0 and 4 are reasonably valued by Agent 4)
- Agent 5: [6] (Item 6 is highly valued by Agent 5)
- Agent 6: [5, 7] (Items 5 and 7 are reasonably valued by Agent 6)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items they value reasonably high.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [5, 7]
}
```
