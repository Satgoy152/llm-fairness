Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  67  27  50  75  32  18  81  39
1  77  83  17  48  48   2  38  55  30
2  15  17  90  29  44  70  10  76  50
3   9  26  57  18  44  35  16  31   7
4  30  13  73  56  82  78  56  23  63
5  21   0  15  98   1  26  85  26  96
6  84  50  79  59  53  39  75  13  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can look for a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach ensures that each item goes to the agent who would benefit the most from it. However, this might not result in a fair distribution of items among agents. Therefore, we may need to make some adjustments to balance the number of items each agent receives.

Let's go through the table and allocate items:

1. Item 0: Agent 6 values it the most at 84.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 83.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 90.
4. Item 3: Agent 5 values it the most at 98.
5. Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most at 82.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 70.
7. Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most at 85.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most at 81.
9. Item 8: Agent 5 values it the most at 96.

After this initial allocation, the distribution is:
- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2, 5]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [3, 6, 8]
- Agent 6: [0]

Agent 3 has not received any items. We can adjust the allocation by transferring one item from an agent who received multiple items to Agent 3. For example, we can transfer item 6 from Agent 5 to Agent 3, as Agent 5 received three items.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2, 5]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [3, 8]
- Agent 6: [0]

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 8],
    "6": [0]
}
```
