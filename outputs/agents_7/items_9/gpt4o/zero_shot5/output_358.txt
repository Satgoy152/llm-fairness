Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  99  67  53  52  80  72  36  86
1  15  62  70  84  21   9  79  87  82
2   9  59  86  19  28   8  18  97  87
3  80  70  22  75  54  49   2  40  61
4  40  34  27  65  32  97  83  34  45
5  99  64  78  54  85  34  15  34  15
6  40  13  49  84  81  93  74  47  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim for a distribution that maximizes overall satisfaction or remains as fair as possible. Since there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive none. We will try to balance the allocations based on their valuations.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 highly (85), so we assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 7 highly (87), so we assign item 7 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 7 highly (97), but since it is already assigned, we assign item 8 (87) to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly (80), but since it is already assigned, we assign item 3 (75) to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly (97), so we assign item 5 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 0 highly (99), but since it is already assigned, we assign item 1 (64) to Agent 5.
- Agent 6 values item 5 highly (93), but since it is already assigned, we assign item 3 (84) to Agent 6.

Now we review any unassigned items:
- Items 2, 4, and 6 are unallocated.

To finalize:
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as their next highest valuation.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3, as their next highest valuation.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 6, as their next highest valuation.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7, 2],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, and we aim to balance based on each agent's highest value preferences, while ensuring the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.
