Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74   3  14  45  17  77  91  23  51
1  50   0  19   6  40  85  99  73  86
2  34  98  14  97  13  56   5  63  73
3  84  77  82  48  75  22  68  99  30
4  94  62   4  19  21  87  77  33  64
5  72  60  91  54  62  91  80  96  57
6  94  82  36  26  72  33  73  10  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a relatively equitable share of their preferred items. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Highest Valuation First**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each item goes to the agent who has the highest preference for it.

2. **Resolve Conflicts**: If more than one agent values an item equally, we will assign that item to one of those agents, balancing the number of items each agent receives.

Let's apply this method to the given table:

- **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it at 94 (highest).
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it at 98 (highest).
- **Item 2**: Agent 5 values it at 91 (highest).
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it at 97 (highest).
- **Item 4**: Agent 6 values it at 72 (highest).
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 77 (highest).
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 99 (highest).
- **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it at 99 (highest).
- **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it at 86 (highest).

Now, let's distribute the items among the agents:

- Agents 0, 1, and 3 have one item so far.
- Agent 2 has two items.
- Agent 4 has one item.
- Agent 5 has one item.
- Agent 6 has one item.

Allocating the remaining items to balance the distribution equally:

- Agent 0: 1 item
- Agent 1: 2 items
- Agent 2: 2 items
- Agent 3: 1 item
- Agent 4: 1 item
- Agent 5: 1 item
- Agent 6: 1 item

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair number of items based on their preferences, while also ensuring all items are allocated.
