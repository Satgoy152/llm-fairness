Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69  38  16  30  30  63  50  86  59
1  18  98  47  66  44  55  26  51  52
2  62  87  85  55  28  91  30  23  10
3  81   8  75  54  62  24   8  28  54
4  60  88  95  43  25  28  70  98  87
5  65  92   5  65  56  59  23  46  52
6  91   2  50  56  66  96  86  69   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91  2 50 56 66 96 86 69  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Given the constraints, we'll attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 7.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 highly.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the most.
6. Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 3.
7. Agent 6 values item 6 the highest.

Taking these into account, here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 7
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 2
- Agent 5: Item 3
- Agent 6: Item 6

Now we have allocated 7 items. We have 2 more items (4 and 8) to allocate.

- Agent 0 can also take item 8, as they have a relatively high valuation for it.
- Agent 4 can take item 4, as they have a moderate valuation for this item.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 4],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [6]
}
```
