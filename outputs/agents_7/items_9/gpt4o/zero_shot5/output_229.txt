Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  72  38  33  32  65  94  84  43
1  80  34  60  40  60  56  51  80  19
2  13  75  47  59  89  89   3  51  44
3  35  95  33  63  90  48  42  71  42
4  72  25  22  61  32  17  22  14  90
5  69  50  69  26  26  93  21  20  50
6  21  80  71  56   8  20  79  68  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for their assigned items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a suggested allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Assign the item with the highest value to the respective agent.
2. Consider each agent's second-best item, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [6] (value 94)
- Agent 1: Items [0, 7] (values 80, 80)
- Agent 2: Items [4] (value 89)
- Agent 3: Items [1] (value 95)
- Agent 4: Items [8] (value 90)
- Agent 5: Items [5] (value 93)
- Agent 6: Items [2, 3] (values 71, 56)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2, 3]
}
```
