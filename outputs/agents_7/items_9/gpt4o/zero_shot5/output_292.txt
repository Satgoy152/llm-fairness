Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  56  93  64  94  56  98  22  49
1  47  11  96  47  46  98  47  49   7
2  95  40  84  26  38  23  82  93   5
3  23  66  80  21  51  77  38  68   1
4   8  28  48  46  74  68  29  41  73
5  70  14  67   4   6  99   3  52  42
6  14  74  49  71  21  13  24  10  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to distribute them such that the total value perceived by each agent is balanced as closely as possible. Here's one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Start by assigning the highest-valued item for each agent.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. Balance the remaining items to achieve fairness in perceived value.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most: Item 6
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most: Item 5
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most: Item 0
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most, but it's taken, so allocate the second highest: Item 1
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most: Item 4
- Agent 5 values item 5 the most, already taken, so allocate the next: Item 8
- Agent 6 values item 3 the most: Item 3

Now, adjust for fairness:

- Agent 0 gets another item to balance: Item 2
- Agent 1 gets another item: Item 7

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution of perceived value is as fair as possible given the constraints.
