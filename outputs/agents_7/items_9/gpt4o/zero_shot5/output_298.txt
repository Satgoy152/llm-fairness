Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  49  13  55  12  30  26  12  79
1  36  99  75  39  75  81  85  20  56
2  30  81  84  60  66  83  70  96  67
3  21  10  81  88  70  50  92  74  88
4   2  55  75  90   4  21  44  95  51
5  82  48  56  75  85  35  27  30  13
6   5  90  22   9  69  11  28  37  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. We consider the possibility of ensuring each agent receives at least one item, but this is not strictly necessary if it leads to an unfair distribution.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Assign item 8 to agent 0 (value of 79).
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value of 99).
- Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value of 96).
- Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value of 92).
- Assign item 3 to agent 4 (value of 90).
- Assign item 0 to agent 5 (value of 82).
- Assign item 4 to agent 6 (value of 69).
- Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value of 84).
- Assign item 5 to agent 6 (value of 11).

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and attempts to maximize the value each agent receives. Note that the allocation involves strategic choices to maximize the total valuation.

The resulting allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [4, 5]
}
```
