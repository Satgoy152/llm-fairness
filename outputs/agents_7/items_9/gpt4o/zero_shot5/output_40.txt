Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  76  98  57  38  94  10  23  58
1  88  38  99  23  77  38  40  37  87
2  32  20  96  27  16  39  27  49   9
3   4  64  30  52   4   2   5  59  76
4  43  55  14  77  74  19  31  25  70
5  91  21  38  54  56  60  79  74   2
6  42   4  85  12  88  35  57  11  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. A common approach is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Analyze the valuations and assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Highest value is 91 by agent 5.
- Item 1: Highest value is 76 by agent 0.
- Item 2: Highest value is 99 by agent 1.
- Item 3: Highest value is 77 by agent 4.
- Item 4: Highest value is 88 by agent 6.
- Item 5: Highest value is 94 by agent 0.
- Item 6: Highest value is 79 by agent 5.
- Item 7: Highest value is 74 by agent 5.
- Item 8: Highest value is 90 by agent 6.

Allocations based on the highest values:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Item [3]
- Agent 5: Items [0, 6, 7]
- Agent 6: Items [4, 8]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 6, 7],
    "6": [4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
