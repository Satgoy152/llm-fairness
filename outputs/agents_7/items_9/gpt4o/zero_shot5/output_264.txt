Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  11  75  32  62  13  72  52  48
1  49  35  62  89  73  57  79  41  77
2  18  14  96  64  56  87  25   4   8
3  74  17  71  78  89  86  54  99  15
4  13  54  67  11  88  71   8  56  80
5  91  31  40  76  38  57  52  92  11
6  26  34   8  51  58   5  58  29  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated and each agent can receive zero or more items. One potential method is to allocate items based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring a balanced distribution of high-value items among agents:

1. Assign an item to an agent if they value it significantly more than other agents.
2. Distribute the remaining items to balance the number of items each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 7 (99).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 2 (96).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 3 (89).
- Agent 3 also has the highest value for item 4 (89).
- Agent 5 has the highest value for item 0 (91).
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 8 (80).
- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 6 (72).
- Agent 4 also has the highest value for item 5 (71).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 1 (35).

Each agent gets the following items:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7, 4],
    "4": [8, 5],
    "5": [0],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, and agents receive items based on their highest valuations, achieving a fair distribution.
