Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  15  83  65  85  46  30  15  11
1  80  87  93  82  88  64  77  26   4
2  78   5   3  44  61   8  35  30  73
3  26  29  90  36  95  10  96  82  55
4  21  60  76  42  99  59  25  16  87
5  18  16  35  59  62  40  10  58  46
6  76  55  33  25  81  33   7  75  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or total value received by each agent, taking into account that each agent may have different preferences for different items.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Balance the allocation by ensuring that all agents get a comparable amount of value, even if the number of items varies slightly.

Let's go through the allocation process by assigning items based on the highest valuations:

- Item 0: Highest value is 80 by agent 1
- Item 1: Highest value is 87 by agent 1
- Item 2: Highest value is 93 by agent 1
- Item 3: Highest value is 65 by agent 0
- Item 4: Highest value is 99 by agent 4
- Item 5: Highest value is 64 by agent 1
- Item 6: Highest value is 96 by agent 3
- Item 7: Highest value is 82 by agent 3
- Item 8: Highest value is 87 by agent 4

Now, let's ensure all agents are included and balance the allocation:

1. Agent 0: [3]
2. Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 5]
3. Agent 2: []
4. Agent 3: [6, 7]
5. Agent 4: [4, 8]
6. Agent 5: []
7. Agent 6: []

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned, and agents with the highest valuation for a particular item receive it.

Here is the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [4, 8],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```
