Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22   2  94  82  52  76   2  18  54
1  84   9  96  88  98  22  96  67  25
2  25  40  13  19  16  13  56  52  24
3  32  10  61  22  13  59  43  52  46
4  78  47  58  94  55  86  61  64  63
5   6  67  25   4  72   0  40  57  63
6  34  16  49  45  44  51  28  18  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We need to make sure all 9 items are allocated, with no item left unallocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Assign each agent to the item where they have the highest valuation, then allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution.

Let's calculate the initial allocation based on the highest valuations:

1. Agent 0: Highest valuation is for item 2 (94).
2. Agent 1: Highest valuation is for item 4 (98).
3. Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 6 (56).
4. Agent 3: Highest valuation is for item 2 (61), but item 2 is already taken. Next is item 5 (59).
5. Agent 4: Highest valuation is for item 3 (94).
6. Agent 5: Highest valuation is for item 4 (72), but item 4 is already taken. Next is item 8 (63).
7. Agent 6: Highest valuation is for item 5 (51), but item 5 is already taken. Next is item 8 (47), but item 8 is already taken. Next is item 3 (45).

Next, distribute the remaining items:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 4, who values it at 78.
- Item 1: Assign to Agent 5, who values it at 67.
- Item 7: Assign to Agent 1, who values it at 67.

Now, let's put this allocation into the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 0],
    "5": [8, 1],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, taking into account the highest possible valuations and ensuring each agent receives at least one item where feasible.
