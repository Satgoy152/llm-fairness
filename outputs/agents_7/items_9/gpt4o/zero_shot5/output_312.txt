Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65   4  92  32  97  60   6  31  85
1  17  76  37  85  28  91  25  73  20
2   8  79  20  82  69  26  40  39   6
3  16  27  30  56  38   2  75  19  25
4  48  85  96  50  63  21  82  39  31
5  34  11   4  65  15  81  70  18  69
6   2  81  36  93  36  32  32  37  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated. Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
    - Highest valuations: Item 4 (97), Item 2 (92), Item 8 (85)
    
2. **Agent 1**: 
    - Highest valuations: Item 5 (91), Item 3 (85), Item 1 (76)

3. **Agent 2**: 
    - Highest valuations: Item 1 (79), Item 3 (82), Item 4 (69)

4. **Agent 3**: 
    - Highest valuations: Item 6 (75), Item 3 (56), Item 4 (38)

5. **Agent 4**: 
    - Highest valuations: Item 2 (96), Item 1 (85), Item 6 (82)

6. **Agent 5**: 
    - Highest valuations: Item 5 (81), Item 8 (69), Item 3 (65)

7. **Agent 6**: 
    - Highest valuations: Item 3 (93), Item 8 (89), Item 1 (81)

Let's distribute the items based on each agent's highest valuations while ensuring all items are allocated:

- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2
- Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 4
- Allocate Item 8 to Agent 6
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 5

Now we have 2 items left to allocate: Item 0 and Item 7.

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (second highest)
- Allocate Item 7 to Agent 1 (second highest)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items maximizing their valuations and all items are allocated.
