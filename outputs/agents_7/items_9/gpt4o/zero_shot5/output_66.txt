Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  83  62  65  68  39  84  56   0
1  52  68  49  29  62   1   9  45  69
2  33  87  60  81  63  59  44  17  12
3  20  34  80  99  94  51  22  44  22
4   0   4   2  97  71  49  66  12  79
5   2  74  11  99  16  85  17  60  30
6  98  37  91  91  85  27  87  99  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents based on their valuations, we need to consider both the value each agent places on each item and ensuring that every agent receives at least an opportunity for a fair allocation. Let's try to maximize the overall satisfaction by giving preference to higher valuations while ensuring a fair distribution.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 6, as agent 6 values it the highest at 98.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it highly at 87.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 6, as agent 6 values it highly at 91.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 5, as agent 5 values it highly at 99.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 3, as agent 3 values it at 94.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 5, as agent 5 values it highly at 85.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it highly at 84.
8. Assign item 7 to agent 6, as agent 6 values it highly at 99.
9. Assign item 8 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it at 69.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it highly, while also distributing items as fairly as possible among the agents.

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3, 5],
    "6": [0, 2, 7]
}
```
