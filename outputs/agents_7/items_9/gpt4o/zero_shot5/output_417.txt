Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  24  96   4  85  67  78  70  26
1  81  33  85  49  16  21  50   3  58
2  80   9  17   2  30  68   2  40  40
3  46  95  54  93  88  72  22  85  77
4  88  68  74  88  68  20  16  58  90
5  90  57  18  79  13  51  88  15  39
6  75  10  95  86  22  56  97   9  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that roughly balances the total value of items assigned to each agent. Here's one approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation for all items by each agent.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation for unallocated items, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure all items are allocated and the distribution is as fair as possible.

Letâ€™s distribute the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations - [64, 24, 96, 4, 85, 67, 78, 70, 26]
   - Highest valuation is item 2 (value 96).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Valuations - [81, 33, 85, 49, 16, 21, 50, 3, 58]
   - Highest valuation is item 0 (value 81).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Valuations - [80, 9, 17, 2, 30, 68, 2, 40, 40]
   - Highest valuation is item 0 (value 80), already taken; next highest is item 5 (value 68).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Valuations - [46, 95, 54, 93, 88, 72, 22, 85, 77]
   - Highest valuation is item 1 (value 95).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Valuations - [88, 68, 74, 88, 68, 20, 16, 58, 90]
   - Highest valuation is item 0 (value 88), already taken; next highest is item 8 (value 90).
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Valuations - [90, 57, 18, 79, 13, 51, 88, 15, 39]
   - Highest valuation is item 0 (value 90), already taken; next highest is item 6 (value 88).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 5.

7. **Agent 6**: Valuations - [75, 10, 95, 86, 22, 56, 97, 9, 55]
   - Highest valuation is item 6 (value 97), already taken; next highest is item 2 (value 95), already taken; next is item 3 (value 86).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 6.

Now we have the following items left unallocated: 4 and 7.

Adjust allocations for fairness and to ensure every item is allocated:

- **Agent 4** can take item 4 (value 68).
- **Agent 3** can take item 7 (value 85).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [8, 4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
