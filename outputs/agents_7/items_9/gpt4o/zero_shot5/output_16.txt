Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  92  29  57  67  93  96  93  71
1  17  63  88   3  57  66  63   8  66
2  14  26   4  76  94  70   0  29  68
3  13  93  21  87  32   5  59  12  45
4  32   5  86  14  91  34  31   0  77
5   9  63  51   1  99  16  36  84  12
6  12  90  66  51  56  73  82  41  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while ensuring all items are allocated. We can use a simple heuristic approach to achieve this.

Let's allocate the items to agents based on their highest valuation:

1. Go through each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated by doing this process iteratively.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 85.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 92.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 88.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 87.
- Item 4: Agent 5 values it the most at 99.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 93.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 96.
- Item 7: Agent 5 values it the most at 84.
- Item 8: Agent 4 values it the most at 77.

Now, the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [4, 7],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.
