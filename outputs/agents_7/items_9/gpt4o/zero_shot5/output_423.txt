Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  59  92   4  65  80  42  94  97
1  29  57  93  62  47  15  61  64  46
2  22  58  69  46  18  70  62  81  25
3  16  32  82  35  15  68  74  85  10
4  34  32  42  66  22  79  46  28   7
5  89  86  81  31  37  26  14  62  47
6  57  56  83  74  36  10  18  12  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we will aim to distribute the items based on the highest valuations while ensuring that every agent has the opportunity to receive at least one item if possible. Here's a fair allocation process:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Start by allocating items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent.

2. **Distribute Remaining Items:** Once the highest valuations have been allocated, distribute the remaining items to the agents who have not received any items yet, attempting to balance the total value each agent receives.

By following this methodology, here is a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Receives item 8 (valuation 97).
2. **Agent 1:** Receives item 2 (valuation 93).
3. **Agent 2:** Receives item 7 (valuation 81).
4. **Agent 3:** Receives item 6 (valuation 74).
5. **Agent 4:** Receives item 5 (valuation 79).
6. **Agent 5:** Receives item 0 (valuation 89).
7. **Agent 6:** Receives item 3 (valuation 74) and item 1 (valuation 56).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed based on the highest valuations possible. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [3, 1]
}
```
