Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47   3  27  52  33  26  66  84  13
1  52  93  38  85  32  93  93   6   3
2  73  19  53  59  61  63  25  39  45
3  60  61  48  63  35  89  69  52  69
4  89  32  94  29  52  37  73  60  41
5   2  59  34  15  19  83  54  11  31
6   8  49  89  19  58  14  52  43  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm. This algorithm will assign items to agents based on their highest valuation for each item, ensuring that each item is allocated and all 9 items are assigned by the end.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Item 0:** The highest valuation is by agent 4 with a value of 89.
2. **Item 1:** The highest valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 93.
3. **Item 2:** The highest valuation is by agent 4 with a value of 94.
4. **Item 3:** The highest valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 85.
5. **Item 4:** The highest valuation is by agent 2 with a value of 61.
6. **Item 5:** The highest valuation is by agent 3 with a value of 89.
7. **Item 6:** The highest valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 93.
8. **Item 7:** The highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 84.
9. **Item 8:** The highest valuation is by agent 6 with a value of 65.

Now, let's allocate the items based on these highest valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1, 3, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 2],
    "5": [],
    "6": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their highest valuations.
