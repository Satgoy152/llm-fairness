Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  35  43  14  73  61  39  41   6
1  95  67  56  14  18  37  49   2  35
2  77  85  41  94  42  16  94  59  13
3  89  45  48  63  56  44  84   0  56
4  38   7  56  15  32  32  65   8  96
5  70  66  92  64  16  11   9  21  21
6  85  54  66  49  26  70  51  46   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated. Given there are 7 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others, but we will try to distribute the total valuations as evenly as possible.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring each item is assigned to one agent only:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 (73) the highest.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 (95) the highest.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 (94) the highest.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 (89) the highest, but it's taken, so the next highest is item 6 (84).
5. Agent 4 values item 8 (96) the highest.
6. Agent 5 values item 2 (92) the highest.
7. Agent 6 values item 5 (70) the highest.

Now, let's re-evaluate the unallocated items (1, 7, and 8):

- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest (85), but since Agent 2 already has item 3, we will look at the next highest, which is Agent 1 (67).
- Item 7: Agent 2 also values this item highly (59), so we allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
- Item 8: Agent 4 values it the highest (96), but since Agent 4 already has something, we'll give this to Agent 3 (56).

After re-evaluation, the assignments can be made as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [6, 8],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent is accounted for, with an attempt to balance the total valuations received.
