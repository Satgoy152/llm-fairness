Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  98  17  11  53  69  14  56  34
1  33  21  10  58  51  10  19  95   7
2  93  65  35  75  93  46  19   6  17
3  61  32   8  88  68   8  52  34  38
4  43  54  82  75  57  32  56  50  18
5  36  78  40  48  94  39  82  91  80
6  59  97  66  26  72  41  22  31   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can use a simple approach to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed. Here’s one possible allocation considering the given valuations:

1. Identify the agent who values each item the most and allocate that item to the respective agent.
2. If there are ties, choose an agent who has fewer items allocated so far.

Using this approach, here is the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (highest value: 93)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (highest value: 98)
- Item 2: Agent 4 (highest value: 82)
- Item 3: Agent 3 (highest value: 88)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (highest value: 93)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (highest value: 69)
- Item 6: Agent 5 (highest value: 82)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (highest value: 95)
- Item 8: Agent 5 (highest value: 80)

Now, each agent should have received items fairly based on their valuations. Here’s the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6, 8],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their overall value.
