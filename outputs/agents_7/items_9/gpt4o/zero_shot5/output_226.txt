Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  17  61  74  66  58  83   4  68
1  87  87  19  47  71  50  10  76  83
2  18  65  75  85  45  60  88  44   9
3   1   4  70  61  31  22   5  51  30
4  27  25  35  52  10  31  56  13  33
5  53  19  94  63  80  46  97   2  63
6  44  65  84  13  22  31  82  18   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (83), Item 3 (74), Item 2 (61)
   - Allocation: Items [0, 6]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (87), Item 1 (87)
   - Allocation: Items [1, 8]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (88), Item 3 (85)
   - Allocation: Item [3]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (70), Item 3 (61)
   - Allocation: Item []

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (56), Item 3 (52)
   - Allocation: Item [4]

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (97), Item 2 (94)
   - Allocation: Items [2, 5]

7. **Agent 6**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (82), Item 2 (84)
   - Allocation: Item [7]

However, this distribution doesn't satisfy the constraint that every item must be allocated, so let's adjust it slightly to ensure all items are allocated:

Here's a revised allocation that ensures all items are assigned:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocation: [0, 6]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocation: [1, 8]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocation: [3]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Allocation: []

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Allocation: []

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Allocation: [5, 2]

7. **Agent 6**:
   - Allocation: [4, 7]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5, 2],
    "6": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents.
