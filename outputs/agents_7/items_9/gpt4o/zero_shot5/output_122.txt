Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  75  21  92  64  13  94  57  13
1  96  11  83   4  44  65  41  59  73
2  82  57  57  62  71  58  62  15  80
3   2  64  37  93  81  69  88  65  83
4  73  55  26  87  86  28  79  21  35
5  31  94  47  33  80  79  34  18  42
6   5  65  64  67  66  85   6   6   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, I'll use a simple round-robin method, where each agent gets one item in sequence, prioritizing items with higher valuations for each agent. This ensures that each agent gets a fair chance, and all items are distributed.

Let's start the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is on item 6 (value 94). Allocate item 6.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is on item 0 (value 96). Allocate item 0.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is on item 4 (value 71). Allocate item 4.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is on item 3 (value 93). Allocate item 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is on item 4, which is already taken. Next highest is item 3, also taken. Next is item 0 (value 73). Allocate item 0, but it's taken. Next is item 6 (value 79). Allocate item 6, but it's taken. Allocate item 3, but it's taken. Allocate item 2 (value 26).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for Agent 5 is on item 1 (value 94). Allocate item 1.
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value for Agent 6 is on item 5 (value 85). Allocate item 5.

At this point, the allocations are:
- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: [1]
- Agent 6: [5]

We have 3 items left to allocate (7, 8, 9). Let's continue:

8. **Agent 0**: Next highest value is item 3 (value 92), but it's taken. Next is item 4 (value 64), but it's taken. Next is item 7 (value 57). Allocate item 7.
9. **Agent 1**: All highest priority items are taken until item 8 (value 73). Allocate item 8.
10. **Agent 2**: All highest priority items are taken until item 9 (value 80). Allocate item 9.

Now all 9 items have been allocated. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent has been considered fairly based on their preferences.
