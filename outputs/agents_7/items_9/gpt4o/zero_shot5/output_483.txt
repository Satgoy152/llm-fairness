Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  14  59  70  69  75  35  50  27
1  17  59  79  11  72  72  57  23  75
2   8  73  73  57  59  25  72  72  70
3  58  61  87  91  38   9  22  65   0
4  14  48  91  42  40  45  90  37  96
5  23  22  62  90  48  53  75   5  93
6  51  56  40  80  41  64  98  46   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and considering that each item should be assigned to one agent, we can follow a strategy where we maximize the valuation of items given to each agent. A potential allocation could be achieved by examining the highest values for each item and assigning it to the respective agent who values it the most.

Here is one approach to allocate the items:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it the most at 83.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 2 values it the most at 73.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 3 values it the most at 87.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 3 values it the most at 91.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it the most at 72.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it the most at 75.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 6 values it the most at 98.
8. **Item 7:** Agent 2 values it the most at 72.
9. **Item 8:** Agent 4 values it the most at 96.

Following this allocation strategy, we ensure each item is assigned to one agent based on the highest valuation. Here's how the allocation looks:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among 7 agents, with some agents receiving more than one item and some receiving none, aligning with the requirement for integer allocations.
