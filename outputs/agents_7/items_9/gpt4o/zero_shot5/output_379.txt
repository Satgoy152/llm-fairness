Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  16  75  42  74  16  96  33  55
1  58   3  67   2  46  43  73  87  73
2  58  71  66   6  74  88  46  17  98
3  49  67   9  75  26   4  72  91  23
4  82  30  93  18  71  64  34  54  20
5  15  29  69  59  67  46  94  16  19
6  83   0  89  20  78  76  32  66  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to ensure that each agent receives items with a total value that is as fair as possible. We will distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and the total value distribution is as balanced as possible.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 7 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 8 highly.
- Agent 3 can get item 3.
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly.
- Agent 5 can get item 5.
- Agent 6 values item 0 highly.

Keeping these considerations in mind, the allocation can be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [1],
    "8": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and attempts to distribute the total valuation fairly across the agents.
