Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  41  16   2   8  70  61  17  88
1  96  51  46   6  84  90  77  46  23
2  41  85  45  80   7  85  99  29  34
3  37  66  65  24  74  69  87   1  67
4   9  38  72  48  84  13  83  27  12
5   9  91  56  26  53   7  37  42  99
6  49  82  30  90  96  53   2  61  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [49 82 30 90 96 53  2 61 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that exactly 9 items are allocated in total. This means that some agents might not receive any items. Here is a possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0: Allocate item 8 (Value: 88)
2. Agent 1: Allocate item 5 (Value: 90)
3. Agent 2: Allocate item 6 (Value: 99)
4. Agent 3: Allocate item 3 (Value: 24)
5. Agent 4: Allocate item 4 (Value: 84)
6. Agent 5: Allocate item 1 (Value: 91)
7. Agent 6: Allocate item 7 (Value: 61)

Now we have allocated 7 items. To ensure all 9 items are allocated, we need to assign 2 more items:

8. Agent 2: Allocate item 2 (Value: 45)
9. Agent 6: Allocate item 0 (Value: 49)

This allocation attempts to distribute items based on maximizing the agent's valuation for the item they receive and ensuring each agent has an opportunity to receive at least one item where possible. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [7, 0]
}
```
