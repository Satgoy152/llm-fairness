Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  76  18  40  99  93  37  73  15
1  70  74  99  17  87  82  89  14  53
2  65  39  73  23  58  66  12  66  47
3  81  84  24   9  24  48  85  55  11
4   2   2  49   5  35  52  55  20  29
5   2  82   7  75  18  87  20  45  14
6  44  78  74  47  80  45  99  28   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider both the valuations given by the agents and the requirement that each agent should receive an integer number of items with a total of exactly 9 items allocated. A reasonable approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation values, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible and that the total allocations are fair.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign items to the agents based on their highest valuations for those items, ensuring a fair distribution.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, while respecting the constraint of a total of 9 items.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 6
- Agent 2: Items 5
- Agent 3: Items 1
- Agent 4: Items 8
- Agent 5: Items 3
- Agent 6: Items 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation considers the agents' valuations and ensures that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.
