Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  97   1  99  33  36  96  53  73
1  58  51  74  31  66   6  66  71  94
2  18  99  55   2  34  13  36  97  61
3  27  27  78  42  31  34   2  55  40
4  92  47  15  45  91  61  99  93  89
5  84  62  22  18  15  67   7  88  24
6  15  38   9   1   1  42  23  39  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. Below is a possible allocation strategy.

1. Agent 0: Allocate items with the highest values for agent 0.
2. Agent 1: Allocate items with the highest values for agent 1.
3. Agent 2: Allocate items with the highest values for agent 2.
4. Agent 3: Allocate items with the highest values for agent 3.
5. Agent 4: Allocate items with the highest values for agent 4.
6. Agent 5: Allocate items with the highest values for agent 5.
7. Agent 6: Allocate any remaining items to agent 6.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 99).
- Agent 1 gets item 8 (value 94).
- Agent 2 gets item 1 (value 99).
- Agent 3 gets item 2 (value 78).
- Agent 4 gets item 6 (value 99).
- Agent 5 gets item 5 (value 67).
- Agent 6 gets items 0, 4, and 7 (values 15, 1, and 39 respectively).

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0, 4, 7]
}
```
