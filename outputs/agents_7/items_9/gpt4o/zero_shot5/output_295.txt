Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  71  75  19   0  52  51  61   6
1  75  92  76  35  40   7  17  80  82
2  21   7  79  44  54  21  54  97  95
3  89   5  76  81  81  88   4  57   7
4   7  49  93  41  97  28   7   3  59
5  87  21   7  79  82  19  91  54  45
6  30  99  32   1  79  16  65  54  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Prioritize allocating items to agents based on the highest individual item value.
3. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
4. Distribute remaining items to maximize the total value.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values: [63, 71, 75, 19, 0, 52, 51, 61, 6]
- Agent 1 values: [75, 92, 76, 35, 40, 7, 17, 80, 82]
- Agent 2 values: [21, 7, 79, 44, 54, 21, 54, 97, 95]
- Agent 3 values: [89, 5, 76, 81, 81, 88, 4, 57, 7]
- Agent 4 values: [7, 49, 93, 41, 97, 28, 7, 3, 59]
- Agent 5 values: [87, 21, 7, 79, 82, 19, 91, 54, 45]
- Agent 6 values: [30, 99, 32, 1, 79, 16, 65, 54, 72]

Allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 2 (value = 75)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (value = 92)
- Agent 2: Item 8 (value = 95)
- Agent 3: Item 5 (value = 88)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (value = 97)
- Agent 5: Item 0 (value = 87)
- Agent 6: Item 6 (value = 65)
  
Remaining Items: [3, 7]
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3 (value = 81)
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 2 (value = 97)

Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [8, 7],
    "3": [5, 3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total value across all agents is maximized given the constraints.
