Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91   7  64  87  64  36   7  76  27
1  65  54   4  98  74  92  17  88  89
2  58  81  69  53  30  64   8  96  40
3  82  30   1  31  90  81   4   1   2
4  76  20  72  69  23  13  40  52  13
5  22  29  32  59  76   7  67  11  88
6  56  14  38  52  27  49  50  85  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuation, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (91)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (98)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value item: Item 7 (96)
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (90)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (72)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5:**
   - Highest value item: Item 8 (88)
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 5.

7. **Agent 6:**
   - Highest value item: Item 8 (76), but it's already taken, so next highest is Item 7 (85), but it's also taken.
   - Allocate item 6 (50) as it's the highest available for Agent 6.

Now, we have allocated these items: 0, 3, 7, 4, 2, 8, and 6. Two items remain (items 1 and 5).

We need to allocate these remaining items:

8. **Remaining items:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value among remaining agents for item 1).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value among remaining agents for item 5).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 1, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while all 9 items are distributed.
