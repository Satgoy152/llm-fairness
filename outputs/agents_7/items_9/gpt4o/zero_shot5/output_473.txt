Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  87  27  45  84   6  43  33  63
1  64  80   8   8  94  32  73  38   7
2   2  79  79  77   8  15  59  92  80
3  43  19  29  89  49  93  50   4  25
4  64  32  21  54  53  74  90  37  70
5  99   4  21  57  34  15  92  75  46
6  10  99  22  77  73  88  38  66  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and the distribution is equitable based on their valuations. One approach is to allocate items to agents who value them the most. Here’s a possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Allocated to Agent 5 (value 99)
2. **Item 1**: Allocated to Agent 6 (value 99)
3. **Item 2**: Allocated to Agent 2 (value 79)
4. **Item 3**: Allocated to Agent 3 (value 89)
5. **Item 4**: Allocated to Agent 1 (value 94)
6. **Item 5**: Allocated to Agent 3 (value 93)
7. **Item 6**: Allocated to Agent 4 (value 90)
8. **Item 7**: Allocated to Agent 2 (value 92)
9. **Item 8**: Allocated to Agent 2 (value 80)

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while trying to distribute them as evenly as possible. Now, let’s present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 7, 8],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 9 items, and each agent's allocation is clearly listed.
