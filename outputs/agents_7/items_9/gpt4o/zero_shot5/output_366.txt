Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  68  34  57  74  39  73  64  58
1  71  77  28  26  78  17  85  93  74
2  11  15  37  60  29   0  70  51   4
3  99   1  36  25  31  68  50  58  54
4  33   7  44  68  47  23  92  76  23
5  13  75  49  62  44  38  12  75  90
6  93  52  34  72  79   1  54  27  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total value for the items they receive. We'll try to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest-valued items for Agent 0 are item 4 (74) and item 6 (73). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest-valued items for Agent 1 are item 7 (93), item 6 (85), and item 4 (78). Assign item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest-valued items for Agent 2 are item 6 (70) and item 3 (60). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest-valued item for Agent 3 is item 0 (99). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest-valued item for Agent 4 is item 6 (92), but it's already taken. The next highest are item 3 (68) and item 7 (76). Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: The highest-valued items for Agent 5 are item 8 (90) and item 7 (75). Assign item 8 to Agent 5.

7. **Agent 6**: The highest-valued items for Agent 6 are item 3 (72) and item 4 (79), but both are taken. The next highest is item 0 (93), but it's also taken. Assign item 2 (34) to Agent 6.

Now, let's check the allocation so far:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [8]
- Agent 6: [2]

This accounts for 7 items. We need to allocate 2 more items:

- The remaining items are [1, 5].

Let's allocate them based on remaining high values:

- **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (77) to Agent 1.
- **Agent 5**: Assign item 5 (38) to Agent 5.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [8, 5],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their highest preferences, and all 9 items are allocated.
