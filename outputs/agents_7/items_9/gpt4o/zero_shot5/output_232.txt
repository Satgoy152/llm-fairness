Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  55  57  17  97  15   4  98  60
1  40  23  45  52  74   3  70  78  45
2  44  68  77  89  51  36  20  55  74
3   9  81   0  43  87  30  89  77  71
4  56  94  16  10  55  98  14  20  74
5  71  17   5  29  81  63  51  18  99
6  17  13  48   1  47  51  95  40   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction. We'll use a simple approach to distribute the items based on the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's determine the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 4 and 7 with values 97 and 98. Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 4 and 7 with values 74 and 78. Since item 7 is already allocated, allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 2 and 3 with values 77 and 89. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 1 and 6 with values 81 and 89. Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 1 and 5 with values 94 and 98. Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 8 with a value of 99. Allocate item 8 to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is for item 6 with a value of 95, but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 5 with a value of 51, but it's also allocated. Allocate item 0 to Agent 6 since it's not yet allocated and has a value of 17 for Agent 6.

Finally, we still have items 1 and 2 unallocated. Let's assign them to agents with fewer items:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 since it has a high value of 77 for them.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 as it has a high value of 81 for them and they currently have only one item.

Now, we allocate all items:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 9.
