Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  87  18  86  60  33  66  95  52
1  76  50  25  79   5  65  22  69  48
2  39  45  48  60  94  82  14  30  38
3  31  46  90  20  10  98  13  49  93
4  19  52  98  67  65  69  86  71   0
5  34  29  90  68  88  23  95  29  71
6  56  82  70  44   4  16  71  76  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can employ the concept of maximizing total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
3. After ensuring each agent has at least one item, continue to assign the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's perform this allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent first.
2. Distribute the remaining items based on the highest value for each unassigned item.

Here is one possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6, 8],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 9.
