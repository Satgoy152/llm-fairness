Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  84  76  45  51  73  89  62  84
1  41  37  99  48  32  69  64  56  11
2  25  40   0  72   1   4  69  81  34
3  33  66  32  94  25  52  25  37  99
4   4  42  25  13  36   5  67  90  71
5   0  22   8  63  18  84  16   8  57
6  86   6  94  36  13  25  63  97  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuations for the items. Given that there are 9 items and 7 agents, not all agents will receive an item, but we will ensure that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (90) and 6 (89).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (81).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 8 (99) and 3 (94).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (90, but already taken by Agent 2).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (84).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (97, but already taken by Agent 2).

Considering the above observations, here's a possible allocation that maximizes fairness:

- **Agent 0**: [0] (Item 0 has a high valuation for Agent 0)
- **Agent 1**: [2] (Item 2 has the highest valuation for Agent 1)
- **Agent 2**: [7] (Item 7 has the highest valuation for Agent 2)
- **Agent 3**: [8, 3] (Items 8 and 3 have high valuations for Agent 3)
- **Agent 4**: [] (No items with high unique valuations left)
- **Agent 5**: [5] (Item 5 has the highest valuation for Agent 5)
- **Agent 6**: [6, 1, 4] (Items 6, 1, and 4 can be allocated based on remaining options)

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [8, 3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6, 1, 4]
}
```
