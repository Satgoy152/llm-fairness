Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  18  16  94  43  72  83  36  34
1  50  76  10  92  88  81  48  74   4
2  66  42   8  25  77  97  25  97  32
3  57  97  27   2  65   5  92  36  79
4  95  54  88  67  21  87  11  81  70
5  53  18  37  40  94  59  71  62  50
6  13  37  64  75  34  17  62  43   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given there are 7 agents and 9 items, a straightforward approach is to assign one item to each agent based on their highest valuation, and then allocate the remaining items to agents who have the next highest valuations for those items. Here's how it can be done:

1. **Initial Allocation:** Assign each agent their most valued item.
2. **Distribute Remaining Items:** Assign the remaining items to the agents who value them next the most without giving any agent more than one additional item initially.

Let's go through the allocations step-by-step:

- **Agent 0:** Highest valuation item is Item 3 (value 94).
- **Agent 1:** Highest valuation item is Item 3 (value 92), but it's already taken. Next highest is Item 4 (value 88).
- **Agent 2:** Highest valuation item is Item 5 (value 97).
- **Agent 3:** Highest valuation item is Item 1 (value 97).
- **Agent 4:** Highest valuation item is Item 0 (value 95).
- **Agent 5:** Highest valuation item is Item 4 (value 94), but it's already taken. Next highest is Item 6 (value 71).
- **Agent 6:** Highest valuation item is Item 3 (value 75), but it's already taken. Next highest is Item 2 (value 64).

Now, we have allocated 7 items. We need to allocate 2 more items:

- **Remaining Items:** Items 7 and 8.

Allocate the remaining items based on the next highest unallocated value:

- **Item 7:** Highest unallocated valuation is Agent 2 (value 97).
- **Item 8:** Highest unallocated valuation is Agent 1 (value 4), but we'll consider a better fit based on previous allocations:

After considering the allocations and ensuring fairness, let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly while distributing all 9 items.
