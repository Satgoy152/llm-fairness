Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  62  55  79  58  77  11  34  29
1  54  28  14  46  40  88  26  67  17
2  57  15  72  56  79  96  93  53  75
3  94  13  62  83  56  67  41  48  87
4  81  84   8   1  83  49   7  62  43
5  58  85  66  31   6  75  27  97  56
6  62  32  28  82  88  56  67  22  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to distribute the items such that each agent gets items with values that are relatively high for them, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item whenever possible and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Here's a possible allocation based on the highest valuations for each agent:

1. Agent 0: Items [3, 5]
   - Item 3 has a value of 79 for Agent 0, which is the highest for this agent.
   - Item 5 has a value of 77 for Agent 0, which is the second-highest for this agent.

2. Agent 1: Item [5]
   - Item 5 has a value of 88 for Agent 1, which is the highest for this agent.

3. Agent 2: Item [6]
   - Item 6 has a value of 93 for Agent 2, which is the highest for this agent.

4. Agent 3: Item [0]
   - Item 0 has a value of 94 for Agent 3, which is the highest for this agent.

5. Agent 4: Item [1]
   - Item 1 has a value of 84 for Agent 4, which is the highest for this agent.

6. Agent 5: Item [7]
   - Item 7 has a value of 97 for Agent 5, which is the highest for this agent.

7. Agent 6: Item [4, 8]
   - Item 4 has a value of 88 for Agent 6, which is the highest for this agent.
   - Item 8 has a value of 74 for Agent 6, which is also a high value for this agent.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it highly, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [4, 8]
}
```
