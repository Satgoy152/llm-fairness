Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  73  16  29  55  44   8  74   7
1  94  48  82  45  89   2   0  52  62
2  51  49  94  37  45  33  71  37  83
3  10   8  72  85  30  19   6   3  88
4  95  88   6  96  20  49  19  62  49
5  78  73  64   9  22  61  28  15  63
6  25  45  72  50  90  28   6  31   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning them the items they value most, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item where possible.

The following allocation strategy ensures each agent gets at least one item and attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction:

1. Assign each agent their highest valued item that hasn't already been allocated.
2. If any items remain unallocated, assign them to the agent who values them most, considering their current allocations.

Let's break down the allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (73).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (94).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (94).
- Agent 3 values item 8 the most (88).
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most (96).
- Agent 5 values item 5 the most (61).
- Agent 6 values item 4 the most (90).

Now let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 1 (73).
- Agent 1: Allocate item 0 (94).
- Agent 2: Allocate item 2 (94).
- Agent 3: Allocate item 8 (88).
- Agent 4: Allocate item 3 (96).
- Agent 5: Allocate item 5 (61).
- Agent 6: Allocate item 4 (90).

The remaining unallocated items are 6 and 7. We can assign these based on the next highest preferences:

- Agent 2 values item 7 with a value of 37, which is highest among unallocated items. Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
- Agent 0 values item 6 with a value of 8, which is highest among remaining unallocated items. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.

The final allocation of items is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4]
}
```
