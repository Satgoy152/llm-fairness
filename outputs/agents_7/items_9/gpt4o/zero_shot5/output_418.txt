Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82   6  64  23  50  21  31  17  51
1   3  69  11   6  63  95  19  93  46
2  71  28  73  67  66  85  34  83  34
3  52  16   6   5  87  75  43  86  77
4  45  77  68  31  13  44   5  21  21
5   7  26  37  47  15  86  54  72  91
6   5  46   6  54  15  24  49  62  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item if possible, and exactly 9 items are allocated in total.

Let's analyze the agents and their valuations for the items:

1. Find the highest-valued items for each agent to maximize their satisfaction.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, starting with the highest-value item for each agent.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value is for item 0 (82).
- Agent 1: Highest value is for item 5 (95).
- Agent 2: Highest value is for item 5 (85), but since it's already taken by Agent 1, choose the next highest, item 2 (73).
- Agent 3: Highest value is for item 4 (87).
- Agent 4: Highest value is for item 1 (77).
- Agent 5: Highest value is for item 8 (91).
- Agent 6: Highest value is for item 8 (89), but since it's already taken by Agent 5, choose the next highest, item 3 (54).

Now fill in the remaining items to agents who could have a secondary high value for them:

- For item 6, Agent 5 has a decent value (54).
- For item 7, Agent 1 has a high value (93).

After these allocations, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [8, 6],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, maximizing their satisfaction based on their highest available valuations.
