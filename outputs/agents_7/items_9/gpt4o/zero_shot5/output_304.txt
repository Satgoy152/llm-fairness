Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  98  72  18  65  24  40  33  39
1  70  80  74  22  71  14  26  52  26
2  41  66  55  93  33  12  49   2  28
3  41  12  28  79  17  64  57  32  42
4  17  26  86  64  55  82  29  32  77
5  41  46   2  71  60  14  61  38  48
6  37  17  23  31  43  62  93  78  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, given there are enough items. We will aim to balance fairness and valuation as much as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** Calculate the sum of valuations for each agent across all items to understand each agent's preferences.

2. **Initial Allocation:** Start by allocating the item with the highest valuation to each agent.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:** Distribute the remaining items to the agents based on maximizing the total valuation, ensuring some balance across the agents.

### Calculations:

1. **Total Valuations:**
    - Agent 0: 401
    - Agent 1: 435
    - Agent 2: 379
    - Agent 3: 372
    - Agent 4: 468
    - Agent 5: 381
    - Agent 6: 444

2. **Initial Allocations:**
    - Agent 0: Item 1 (Value: 98)
    - Agent 1: Item 2 (Value: 74)
    - Agent 2: Item 3 (Value: 93)
    - Agent 3: Item 5 (Value: 64)
    - Agent 4: Item 2 (Value: 86)
    - Agent 5: Item 6 (Value: 61)
    - Agent 6: Item 6 (Value: 93)

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Balance the allocations to ensure fairness and complete the allocation of all items.

### Final Allocation:
Considering the total valuations and ensuring all items are allocated, we can arrive at a fair distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 8],
    "6": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items that align with their preferences while ensuring all items are distributed. Note that some agents might have more items due to higher total valuations and the need to allocate all 9 items.
