Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  39  82  87  75  37  55  78  96
1  30  49  47  12  23  24  94  54  40
2  37  73  75   8  71  84  91  55  92
3  65  44   2  94  52   1   0  76  98
4  92  76  98  62  94  53  80  84  84
5  96  72  17  52  33  76   5  45  41
6  59   2  88  72  91  33  47  81  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a method that aims to give each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and no agent receives more items than necessary. Here's one way to approach this allocation problem:

1. **Calculate the total number of items:** We have 9 items and 7 agents, so not all agents will receive an item.

2. **Assign items based on the highest valuations:** We will examine which agent values each item the most and assign the item to that agent.

3. **Check for fairness:** Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's work through the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 8 the most at 96.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most at 94.
- Agent 2 values item 8 the next highest at 92 (but item 8 was given to Agent 0).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the next highest at 91 (but item 6 was given to Agent 1).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the next highest at 84.
- Agent 3 values item 8 the next highest at 98 (but item 8 was given to Agent 0).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the next highest at 94.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most at 98.
- Agent 5 values item 0 the most at 96.
- Agent 6 values item 8 the next highest at 97 (but item 8 was given to Agent 0).

Continuing this until all items are allocated, we ensure each item is assigned to the agent who values it most among the remaining unallocated items.

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [4, 7, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints and the valuations provided.
