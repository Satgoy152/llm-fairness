Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  38  95  45  10  97  54   9   9
1  91  55  46  89  37  80  25  51  71
2  81  30  80  17  33  65  10  78   4
3  97  55  94  24  68  38  92  75  51
4  34  16  62  97  39  78  50  76  80
5  24  56  99  20  75  10  68  63  69
6  52  16  96  56  22  18  15  33  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy focusing on assigning items to the agents who value them the most:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [89, 38, 95, 45, 10, 97, 54, 9, 9]
   - Max value is for item 5 (97).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [91, 55, 46, 89, 37, 80, 25, 51, 71]
   - Max value is for item 0 (91).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [81, 30, 80, 17, 33, 65, 10, 78, 4]
   - Max value is for item 0 (81), but item 0 is already allocated. Next highest value is item 7 (78).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values: [97, 55, 94, 24, 68, 38, 92, 75, 51]
   - Max value is for item 0 (97), but item 0 is already allocated. Next highest value is item 2 (94).

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Values: [34, 16, 62, 97, 39, 78, 50, 76, 80]
   - Max value is for item 3 (97).

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Values: [24, 56, 99, 20, 75, 10, 68, 63, 69]
   - Max value is for item 2 (99), but item 2 is already allocated. Next highest value is item 8 (69).

7. **Agent 6**: 
   - Values: [52, 16, 96, 56, 22, 18, 15, 33, 36]
   - Max value is for item 2 (96), but item 2 is already allocated. Next highest value is item 3 (56), but item 3 is already allocated. Next is item 1 (16).

Let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 4 has not been allocated yet. It has a relatively high value for Agent 5 (75).
- Item 6 has not been allocated yet. It has a relatively high value for Agent 3 (92).

Final allocation:
- **Agent 0**: [5]
- **Agent 1**: [0]
- **Agent 2**: [7]
- **Agent 3**: [2, 6]
- **Agent 4**: [3]
- **Agent 5**: [8, 4]
- **Agent 6**: [1]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [8, 4],
    "6": [1]
}
```
