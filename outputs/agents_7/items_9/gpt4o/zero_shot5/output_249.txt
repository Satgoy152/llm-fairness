Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  98  54  43  32  94  52  28   7
1   9   1  79  40  79  82   6  66  20
2  99  17  38  68  64  38   3  52  99
3  29  32  87  95  16  81  47  30  98
4  37  63  79  14  12  18  67  84  80
5  81  99  59  77  39  95  69  99  15
6  70  36  88  84  71  32  43  14  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others might receive none.

To achieve this, we can use a greedy approach where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each item is allocated only once. We will then present the allocation in the required JSON format.

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 99 (Agent 2)
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 99 (Agent 5)
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 88 (Agent 6)
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 95 (Agent 3)
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 79 (Agent 1)
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 95 (Agent 5)
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 69 (Agent 5)
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 99 (Agent 5)
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is 99 (Agent 2)

We should ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, but given the constraints, some agents may not receive any.

Here's the allocation based on maximizing the value each agent receives:

- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [0, 8]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [1, 5, 6, 7]
- Agent 6: [2]

Now, here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 5, 6, 7],
    "6": [2]
}
```
