Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  65  28  16  24  24  97  31  23
1   0  18  15  75  86  69  62  51  91
2   7  55  22  10  22  97  63  83  85
3  81  24  76   9  87  62  14  68  47
4  41  47  36  55  98  28  29   6  20
5  88  30   6  48  38  80  70  89  62
6   5  77  73  12  66  62  93  23  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent gets based on their preferences. One method to achieve a fair distribution is to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and then distribute the remaining items to maximize the total value for all agents.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent one of their highest-value items that hasn't been assigned yet.
2. Continue distributing items to maximize the total value.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0: Highest value item is 6 (value 97).
2. Agent 1: Highest value item is 8 (value 91).
3. Agent 2: Highest value item is 5 (value 97).
4. Agent 3: Highest value item is 4 (value 87).
5. Agent 4: Highest value item is 4 (value 98), but it's taken, so choose next highest available: 3 (value 55).
6. Agent 5: Highest value item is 7 (value 89).
7. Agent 6: Highest value item is 6 (value 93), but it's taken, so choose next highest available: 1 (value 77).

Now, we have allocated 7 items. We need to allocate 2 more items. We'll go through each agent's preferences again to allocate the remaining items:

8. Agent 0: Next highest available is 0 (value 93).
9. Agent 2: Next highest available is 8 (value 85).

Now all 9 items are allocated. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences while ensuring that all items are assigned.
