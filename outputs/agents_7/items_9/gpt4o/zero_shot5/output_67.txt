Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  48  31  19  64  91  78  26  54
1   6  90  78   9  63   8  75  43  74
2  83  95  41  79  61  79   7  50  44
3  59  90  30  76  90  81  48  97  40
4  52  38  85  72  33  21  26  78   8
5  76  17  85  35  76  58  40  26  33
6  76  14  64  77  19  48  77  47   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can utilize a round-robin approach based on the agents' valuation sums. First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items to ensure a fair distribution.

The total valuations for each agent are as follows:

- Agent 0: 71 + 48 + 31 + 19 + 64 + 91 + 78 + 26 + 54 = 482
- Agent 1: 6 + 90 + 78 + 9 + 63 + 8 + 75 + 43 + 74 = 446
- Agent 2: 83 + 95 + 41 + 79 + 61 + 79 + 7 + 50 + 44 = 539
- Agent 3: 59 + 90 + 30 + 76 + 90 + 81 + 48 + 97 + 40 = 611
- Agent 4: 52 + 38 + 85 + 72 + 33 + 21 + 26 + 78 + 8 = 413
- Agent 5: 76 + 17 + 85 + 35 + 76 + 58 + 40 + 26 + 33 = 446
- Agent 6: 76 + 14 + 64 + 77 + 19 + 48 + 77 + 47 + 9 = 431

To ensure fairness, we want to give priority to agents with higher valuations for items while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Given that we have seven agents and nine items, each agent will ideally receive one item, and two agents will receive a second item. 

Let's proceed with an allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent first.
2. Distribute the remaining items based on who has the least total valuation from their currently assigned items.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 5 (highest value: 91)
- Agent 1 receives item 1 (highest value: 90)
- Agent 2 receives item 1 (highest value: 95), but since item 1 is already allocated, we'll take the next highest, item 3 (79)
- Agent 3 receives item 1 (highest value: 90), but since item 1 is already allocated, we'll take the next highest, item 7 (97)
- Agent 4 receives item 2 (highest value: 85)
- Agent 5 receives item 2 (highest value: 85), but since item 2 is already allocated, we'll take the next highest, item 0 (76)
- Agent 6 receives item 6 (highest value: 77)

Now, distribute the remaining items 0, 4, and 8:

- Agent 3 receives item 4 (next highest among remaining items: 90)
- Agent 0 receives item 8 (next highest among remaining items: 54)

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7, 4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6]
}
```
