Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  66  78  12  65  23  91  87  15
1  19  59   8  34  79  24  42   5  37
2  78  79   3  37  85  69  81  80   5
3  43  76  24  85  39  82  11  83  55
4  80  94   6   7   0  35  84  20  63
5  83  86  54  84   8   8  41  12  59
6  71  34  86  77  70  54  42  65  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Since there are more items than agents, some agents will receive more than one item. A possible approach is to assign items based on maximizing the value for each agent while considering the total number of items each agent should receive.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high value for items 2 and 6.
- Agent 1 has high value for item 4.
- Agent 2 has high value for items 0 and 1.
- Agent 3 has high value for items 3 and 7.
- Agent 4 has high value for item 8.
- Agent 5 has no items with particularly high value compared to other agents, so we assign leftovers.
- Agent 6 has high value for item 5.

With this in mind, we can make the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, maximizing the satisfaction based on their valuations.
