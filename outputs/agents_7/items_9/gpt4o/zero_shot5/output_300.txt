Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  31  68  77  19  15  49  58  24
1  57  48  51  58  91  45  20  84   6
2  75  92   6  19  21  32  27  22  98
3   4  49  71   2  87  42  26  81  58
4  76  23  24   8  73  19  96  71  36
5  25   9  98  62  26  41  82  56   0
6  11  80  56   6  28  13  77  48  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we'll aim to balance the total value each agent receives. We have 9 items to allocate among 7 agents, which means some agents will receive more items than others. Here's one way to do it:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would gain if given any specific item.
2. Distribute the items such that the total value each agent gains is as balanced as possible.

After considering the valuations and trying to distribute the items fairly based on maximizing the perceived values, here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, with some agents receiving more based on their valuations, while maintaining a balance in total perceived value among all agents.
