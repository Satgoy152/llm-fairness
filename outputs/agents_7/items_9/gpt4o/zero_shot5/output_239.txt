Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  14  84  32  87  80  43  97  27
1  74  35  92  67  75  15  97  10  21
2  36  81  22  41  25  64   8  22  17
3  98  41  59  60  54  26   5  64   8
4  62  54  35  76  70  57  76  87  81
5  31  60  39  75   2  16  90   5  86
6  28  56   0  94  38  24  76  33  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation that attempts to achieve a fair distribution based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 7 and 4.
2. Agent 1 values items 2 and 6 highly.
3. Agent 2 doesn't have any particularly high valuations but can take item 1.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 0.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for items 3 and 8.
6. Agent 5 can take item 5.
7. Agent 6 can take item 6 (although item 6 is also valued by Agent 1, Agent 6 has a decent valuation for it and can also take item 6).

Based on this analysis, here is one allocation:

- Agent 0: [7, 4]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [3, 8]
- Agent 5: [5]
- Agent 6: [6]

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair distribution based on their preferences.

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 8],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6]
}
```
