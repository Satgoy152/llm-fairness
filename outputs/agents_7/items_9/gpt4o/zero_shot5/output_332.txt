Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69  44  39   2  66  14  76  41  60
1  31  88  43  35  31  12  84   1  75
2  12  19  90  43  23  85  63  77  48
3  33  56  72  77  58  47  76  51  15
4  99  64  27  77  15  95  66  65  64
5  96  50  29  37   3  52  57  75  46
6  77  15  29  99  82  28  35  63  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must ensure that each agent gets a roughly equal share of items based on their valuations. We will attempt to distribute the items so that each agent gets either one or two items because there are 9 items to distribute among 7 agents.

Let's evaluate and assign the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 (69), 4 (66), and 6 (76). We can assign item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 (88) and 6 (84). Since item 6 is already taken by Agent 0, we assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** values item 2 (90) the most. We assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 3 (77) and 6 (76). With item 6 already allocated, we assign item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4** values item 0 (99) highly. We assign item 0 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 0 (96) and item 7 (75), but item 0 is already allocated, so we assign item 7 to Agent 5.

7. **Agent 6** values item 3 (99) and item 4 (82) highly. With item 3 already allocated, we assign item 4 to Agent 6.

After these allocations, we still have items 5 and 8 unallocated. Based on the remaining agents' valuations:

- We assign item 5 to Agent 2, who has a high valuation for it (85).
- We assign item 8 to Agent 1, who also has a high valuation for it (75).

Now, each agent has items assigned to them. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [4]
}
```
