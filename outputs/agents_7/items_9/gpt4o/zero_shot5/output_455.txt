Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  90  24  41  36  80  52  20  21
1  14  78  87  61  57   8  39  29  66
2  79  54  66  92   6  94  27  21  70
3  61  90  11  25  64  18  84  56  10
4  81  24  86  31  80  36  19  26  11
5  46  96  10   4  13  73   6  10  82
6  58  85  58  50  24  84  66   8  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider a strategy where each agent receives a selection of items that maximizes their individual valuations, while ensuring each item is assigned to exactly one agent. We will attempt to balance the total value each agent receives to maintain fairness.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 6 (total value = 90 + 52 = 142)
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 8 (total value = 87 + 66 = 153)
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 5 (total value = 92 + 94 = 186)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (total value = 61)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (total value = 80)
- Agent 5: Item 7 (total value = 10)
- Agent 6: No items allocated

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value each agent can get based on their preferences, while ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents in a way that considers the valuations provided.
