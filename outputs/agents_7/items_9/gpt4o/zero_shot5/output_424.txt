Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  25   8  92  79  90  96   3  22
1   0  74  31  21  85  66  39  13  77
2  88  85  51  12  62  32   0  13  53
3  21  78  35  12  29   8  38  66  29
4  15  92  64  25  36  18  21  58   0
5  58  63  33  62  28  31  36  75   7
6   4  85  78  39  31  60  34  98  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated equals 9. We'll aim for an allocation that maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent one item they value highly.
2. Try to maximize the total value by considering remaining items and agents' preferences.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 96.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 85.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 88.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest at 78.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest at 92, but it's already taken. Next best is item 8 at 58.
- Agent 5 values item 7 the highest at 75.
- Agent 6 values item 7 the highest at 98, but it's already taken. Next best is item 2 at 78.

Allocate remaining items:

- Items left: 3, 5
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (second highest value after 6, which was 92)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 6 (after 2, their next best is 60)

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [2, 5]
}
```
