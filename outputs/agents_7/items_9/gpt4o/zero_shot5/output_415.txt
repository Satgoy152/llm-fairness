Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  34  77  59  17   1  78  48   3
1  84  84  54  15  10   3  24  51  72
2  92  36  37  53  72  14  98   3  46
3  29   1  70  78  37  82  84  55  30
4  59  94  44  56  60  92  57  51  57
5  22  39  75  72  46  55  39  56   8
6  60  47  79  39   0  65  19  70  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that considers both the preferences of the agents and ensures a balanced distribution of the total items. This can be achieved by iteratively assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 6, with a valuation of 98.
2. **Agent 0** highly values item 2, with a valuation of 77.
3. **Agent 3** highly values item 3, with a valuation of 78.
4. **Agent 4** highly values item 1, with a valuation of 94.
5. **Agent 5** highly values item 5, with a valuation of 55.
6. **Agent 6** highly values item 8, with a valuation of 81.
7. **Agent 1** highly values item 0, with a valuation of 84.

For the remaining allocations, we distribute the remaining items:

8. **Agent 4** can take item 4 (valuation of 60) because it has the next highest valuation in the remaining unassigned items.
9. **Agent 0** can take item 7 (valuation of 48).

Now, every agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [8]
}
```
