Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  37  88  84  36  47   2  76   5
1  24  21  62  57  88  61  12  25  91
2   4  58  71  33  51  66  53  12  75
3  41  63  63  92  16   9  17   2  43
4  92  42  51  30  36  32  96  84   3
5  31  20  87  44  60  26   8   6  53
6  81  76  52  92  45  91  84  30  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all 9 items are allocated. One approach is to maximize the total value for each agent by assigning items that each agent values highly. Below is one possible allocation that aims to distribute the items fairly:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [2, 3]  
   - This allocation gives Agent 0 high-value items based on their preferences (values 88 and 84).

2. **Agent 1**: Items [4, 8]  
   - Agent 1 values item 4 and item 8 highly (values 88 and 91).

3. **Agent 2**: Item [5]  
   - Item 5 is highly valued by Agent 2 (value 66).

4. **Agent 3**: Items [1, 7]  
   - Agent 3 values items 1 and 7 with decent values (63 and 2).

5. **Agent 4**: Item [6]  
   - Agent 4 values item 6 highly (value 96).

6. **Agent 5**: No items allocated  
   - This agent ends up with no items in this allocation.

7. **Agent 6**: Item [0]  
   - Agent 6 values item 0 highly (value 81).

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0]
}
```
