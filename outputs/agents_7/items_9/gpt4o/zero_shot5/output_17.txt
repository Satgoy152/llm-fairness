Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26   8  51  36  50  85  33  58  23
1  53  76  15  77   9   6  96  98  56
2   5  50  71  98   9  35  58  74  67
3  34  89  29  83  87  47  55  13  32
4   0  42  57  78  50  43  87  82  12
5  99  25  97  99  26  10  27  79  25
6  53  47  51   9   7  91  50  61   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total utility or valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible and all items are allocated. Given there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will end up with more than one item.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the highest valuation for each agent.
2. Assign the item with the highest valuation to each agent.
3. Allocate remaining items to maximize the total valuation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest valuation is 85 for item 5.
- Agent 1: Highest valuation is 98 for item 7.
- Agent 2: Highest valuation is 98 for item 3.
- Agent 3: Highest valuation is 89 for item 1.
- Agent 4: Highest valuation is 87 for item 6.
- Agent 5: Highest valuation is 99 for items 0 and 3. Choose item 0 since item 3 is already taken.
- Agent 6: Highest valuation is 91 for item 5, but it's already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is 61 for item 7, already taken. Then 53 for item 0, already taken. Finally choose item 2 as it's the next highest available.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Remaining items are 4 and 8. Agent 1 can take item 4 for a valuation of 9. Agent 2 can take item 8 for a valuation of 67.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [2]
}
```
