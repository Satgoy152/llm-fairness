Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  70   3  20  45  70  55  11   8
1  91  27  48  75   9   7  66  52  71
2  98  85  10  67  58  96  86  40  30
3  15  51  30  73  97  51  38  35   1
4  61  86   1   6  58  64  54  72  84
5  67  85   1  22  44  73  20  29  66
6  22  69  49  45  96  45  57  59  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 1 and 5 highly. We can allocate these items to maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values items 0 and 8 highly. Allocating these items maximizes their satisfaction.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 2 highly. We can allocate this item to them.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 4 highly. We can allocate this item to them.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 7 highly. We can allocate this item to them.
6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 3 highly. We can allocate this item to them.
7. **Agent 6**: This agent values item 6 highly. We can allocate this item to them.

Based on this approach, the allocation of items would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly and all items are allocated.
