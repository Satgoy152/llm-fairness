Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50   0  48   8  83  69  25  62  73
1  90  70  53  66  85  62  19  46  98
2  23  29  96   9  76   5  34  78  44
3  26  99  15   9   1  39  97  18  17
4  73  15  83  71  99  55  93  93  61
5  45  29   0  96  93  43  18  16  80
6  80  46  42  98  63  13  36  60  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Identify which items are most valued by each agent.
2. Allocate items to maximize individual agent satisfaction while ensuring all items are assigned.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 8.
- Agent 2 highly values item 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 1.
- Agent 4 highly values item 4 but it is already taken, so allocate items 6 and 7.
- Agent 5 highly values item 3.
- Agent 6 highly values item 3, but it is already taken, so allocate item 0.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6, 7],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [0, 5]
}
```

In this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 8.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.
- Agent 3 receives item 1.
- Agent 4 receives items 6 and 7.
- Agent 5 receives item 3.
- Agent 6 receives items 0 and 5.

This ensures all 9 items are allocated.
