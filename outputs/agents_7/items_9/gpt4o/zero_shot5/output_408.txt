Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  96  81  26  50  76  44  20  94
1  88  55  22  17  68   6  91  38  84
2   0  79  22  23  54   0  84  53  78
3   5  18   2  34  31  51  35  15   2
4  64  76  66  20  52  32  23  71  76
5   2  34  27  18  24  35  44  39  28
6   2  29   5  72  88  92  80  51  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (since there are 7 agents and 9 items, two agents will receive an additional item). We'll attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total value from their allocated items.

Here's one potential allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 8
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 6
- Agent 2 receives item: 7
- Agent 3 receives item: 3
- Agent 4 receives item: 4
- Agent 5 receives item: 5
- Agent 6 receives item: 2

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2]
}
```
