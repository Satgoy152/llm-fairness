Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  94  18  29  87  46   5  30  70
1   5  35  79  93  54  43  67  93  94
2  86  85  20  77  23  40  93  38  49
3  29   2   0   0  57  40  46  63  74
4   2  56  60  48  44  15  26  40  21
5  14  74  26  77  91  96  98  14  39
6  71  83  74  57   8  86  32   4   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction or value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's take a simple approach to achieve this:

1. **Determine Total Items and Agents:** We have 9 items and 7 agents.
2. **Assign Items Based on Maximum Valuation:**
   - Each item will be assigned to the agent who values it the most.
   - In case of ties (where multiple agents value an item equally), we can arbitrarily assign the item to one of the tied agents.

Let's calculate the allocations:

- **Item 0:** Highest value is 86 by agent 2.
- **Item 1:** Highest value is 94 by agent 0.
- **Item 2:** Highest value is 79 by agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Highest value is 93 by agent 1.
- **Item 4:** Highest value is 91 by agent 5.
- **Item 5:** Highest value is 96 by agent 5.
- **Item 6:** Highest value is 98 by agent 5.
- **Item 7:** Highest value is 93 by agent 1.
- **Item 8:** Highest value is 94 by agent 1.

This allocation ensures each item goes to the agent who values it the most, maximizing the overall satisfaction.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3, 7, 8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4, 5, 6],
    "6": []
}
```

This distribution ensures that all 9 items are allocated, and each agent has an integer number of items, with some agents receiving no items due to their lower valuations compared to others.
