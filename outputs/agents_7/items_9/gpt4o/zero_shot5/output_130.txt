Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  16  10  14  97  59  78  19  27
1  76  26  85  70  89  64  42  72  95
2   3   6  46   0  64  57  69  92  43
3  43  10  18  16  64  60  33  52  24
4  65  62  21  12  70  66  15  35  19
5  77  59  14  78  44  62  91  22  61
6  13  13  90  26  23  68  10  30  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to distribute them such that each agent gets a roughly equal total value. However, since there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will inevitably receive more items than others. We can try to ensure that the agents receive items that maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly, so assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 8 highly, so assign item 8 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 7 highly, so assign item 7 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 highly, so assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 highly, so assign item 4 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 6 highly, so assign item 6 to agent 5.
7. Agent 6 values item 2 highly, so assign item 2 to agent 6.

Now, we have 2 items left: 1 and 3. Let's allocate them to agents who would benefit highly:

8. Assign item 3 to agent 5, as agent 5 values it at 78.
9. Assign item 1 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it at 62.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 1],
    "5": [6, 3],
    "6": [2]
}
```
