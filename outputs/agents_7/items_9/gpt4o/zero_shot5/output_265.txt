Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  10  88  37   9  22  40  21  34
1  30  52  68  12  62  51  41  29  68
2  95  17  13  92  44  84  96  83   0
3  69  39  70  74  18  75  51  35  69
4  95  58  13  36  85  38  79  52  80
5  43  91  78  73  85  18   6  25   0
6  90  48  64  32  46  27  90  66  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute the items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction or fairness. A simple method to achieve fairness is to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (highest valuation is 88).
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4 (highest valuation is 62).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items 0 and 6 (highest valuations are 95 and 96, respectively).
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 5 (highest valuation is 75).
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate items 8 (highest valuation is 80).
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 1 (highest valuation is 91).
7. **Agent 6**: Allocate items 3 and 7 (highest valuations are 32 and 66, respectively).

This ensures each agent has at least one item and the total number of allocated items equals 9.

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [3, 7]
}
```
