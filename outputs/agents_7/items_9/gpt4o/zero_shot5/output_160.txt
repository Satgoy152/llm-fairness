Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54   8  94  61  15  82  30  71   5
1  68  24  11  96  39  97  29  53  89
2  50  39  25  39  34  76  99  13  94
3  39  83  38  62   7  15   4  90  55
4  31  24  20  12  58  60  18  91  12
5  66   9  91   3  93  11  34  87  60
6  59  80  20  72  11  17  39  38  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and exactly 9 items are allocated in total.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Looking at the valuations, the highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 2 (value 94). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 5 (value 97). Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued item for Agent 2 is item 6 (value 99). Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest valued item for Agent 3 is item 1 (value 83). Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest valued item for Agent 4 is item 7 (value 91). Allocate item 7 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: The highest valued item for Agent 5 is item 4 (value 93). Allocate item 4 to Agent 5.

7. **Agent 6**: The highest valued item for Agent 6 is item 3 (value 72). Allocate item 3 to Agent 6.

Now, we have allocated 7 items in total with each agent getting one item. We have 2 items left to allocate.

8. **Remaining Allocation**:
   - Item 0: Allocate this to Agent 0, as it has the second highest valuation for Agent 0 (value 54).
   - Item 8: Allocate this to Agent 1, as it has a high valuation for Agent 1 (value 89).

Now, all 9 items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required json format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [3]
}
```
