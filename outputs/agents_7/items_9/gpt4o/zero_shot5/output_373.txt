Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  56  60  74  45  30  72  23  33
1  91  99  77  69  41  49  77  31  53
2  75  44  85  97  60  10  24  89  44
3  39  62   8  79  80  78  57  80  59
4  79   7  75  85  48   0  67  82  56
5  49  29  89  41  72   9  50  76  85
6   6  84  33  23  27   7  77  79  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the values each agent assigns to the items and try to distribute them such that the total value each agent receives is balanced. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest, so we assign item 0 to agent 1.
2. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest, so we assign item 3 to agent 0.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 highly, but it's already taken, so we assign item 2, the next highest, to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest, so we assign item 4 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the highest, but it's already taken, so we assign item 7, the next highest, to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 8 the highest, so we assign item 8 to agent 5.
7. Agent 6 values item 1 the highest, so we assign item 1 to agent 6.
8. Agent 1 values item 6 highly, so we assign item 6 to agent 1.
9. Agent 2 also values item 5 highly, so we assign item 5 to agent 2.

Now, every agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [1]
}
```
