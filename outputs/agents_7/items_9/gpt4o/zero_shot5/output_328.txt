Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  87  77  16  65  13  64  39  89
1  83  99  70  99  97  63  69  96  72
2  56  82  54  53  52  66  67  37  95
3  71  87   5  89  89  69  62  66  55
4   0  13  26  19  33  77  39  54  14
5  45  27  11  31  74  80  17  50  69
6  32   9  50  27  99  73  92  58  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations of the items by each agent and try to maximize overall satisfaction. A reasonable strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach ensures that each allocation is optimal in terms of the individual item-agent pair valuations.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the highest valuation.

Applying this method to the given data:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (90)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (99)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (70)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (99)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 6 (99)
- Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 5 (80)
- Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 6 (92)
- Item 7: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (96)
- Item 8: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (95)

Now, ensure each agent's allocation is fair and that no more than 9 items are allocated. We have:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3, 7
- Agent 2: Item 8
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: Item 5
- Agent 6: Items 4, 6

This allocation gives agent 1 four items, which is the highest number of items any agent can have. However, considering the high valuations, this allocation stays optimal.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated while optimizing the total value based on provided valuations.
