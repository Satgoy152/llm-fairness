Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  11   1  14  78  93  58  81  93
1  97   9  24  51  83  43  77  65  65
2  45  94  75  37   9  36  39  30  14
3  81  26  77  11  51  89  64  19  16
4  82  38  86  47  10  97  37   8  19
5  53  56  19  34  61  34  50  95  11
6  19   4  55  70  68  73  89  36  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. Our goal is to ensure that every agent receives an integer number of items, and that all 9 items are allocated without any overlap.

Let's consider the highest-valued items for each agent and allocate them accordingly. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 8 (93).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (97).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (94).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (89).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 5, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 2 (86).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (95).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (89).

Now, we need to ensure that all items are allocated:

- Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Remaining items: 3, 4

Continue allocation with the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 8.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 0.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 1.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 3, as it has a reasonable valuation (11).
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 4, as it is the next available and provides a value (10).

This way, all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 3],
    "4": [2, 4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and maximizes their satisfaction based on their highest valuations for the available items.
