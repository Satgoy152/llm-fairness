Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  29  74  11  82  38  81  87  64
1  97  29  16  72  95  61  91   4  46
2  88  80  58  37  45  79  51  14  75
3  53  75  96  72  52  29  40  41  91
4  67  70  56  90  39  39  11  95  17
5  73   3  21  88  70  82  26  19  32
6   2  65   8  81   0  64  46  42  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and the total number of items allocated equals 9. We can start by attempting to give each agent one item, preferably one they value highly. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most, ensuring no duplicates.
2. Ensure all items are allocated.

Here's one allocation that satisfies these conditions:

- Agent 0 highly values item 4 (value 82).
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (value 97).
- Agent 2 highly values item 0 (value 88), but since it's already taken, we give them item 8 (value 75).
- Agent 3 highly values item 2 (value 96).
- Agent 4 highly values item 7 (value 95).
- Agent 5 highly values item 5 (value 82).
- Agent 6 highly values item 3 (value 81).

Now let's allocate the remaining unassigned items based on the next highest valuations:

- Item 1 and item 6 remain unallocated.
  - Agent 0 will get item 6 (value 81).
  - Agent 2 will get item 1 (value 80).

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 4, 6
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 8, 1
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 7
- Agent 5: Item 5
- Agent 6: Item 3

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and it attempts to respect the agents' preferences as much as possible.

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [8, 1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [3]
}
```
