Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2   4  16  91  73   0   0  29  58
1  99  31  46  27  10  70  42  90  60
2  79  99  32  58  95  81  61  54  35
3  68  26  79  42  93  65  33  43  86
4  13   4  17   4  73  12  24  62  40
5  36  71  96  20  86  45  86  12  52
6  92  18  36  31  90  37  86  38  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items so that the total value each agent receives is as equitable as possible, given the constraints of the problem. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Start by identifying which items each agent values the most.
2. Try to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Balance the total values across agents as closely as possible.

Let's step through this process:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 3 (91), 4 (73), and 8 (58).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value items are 0 (99), 7 (90), and 5 (70).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value items are 1 (99), 4 (95), and 5 (81).
- **Agent 3**: Highest value items are 8 (86), 4 (93), and 2 (79).
- **Agent 4**: Highest value items are 4 (73), 7 (62), and 8 (40).
- **Agent 5**: Highest value items are 2 (96), 4 (86), and 6 (86).
- **Agent 6**: Highest value items are 0 (92), 4 (90), and 6 (86).

Considering this, we can try to allocate items to maximize the value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [3] (Item 3 is highly valued by Agent 0)
- Agent 1: [0] (Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 1)
- Agent 2: [1] (Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 2)
- Agent 3: [8] (Item 8 is highly valued by Agent 3)
- Agent 4: [7] (Item 7 is highly valued by Agent 4)
- Agent 5: [2] (Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 5)
- Agent 6: [4, 5, 6] (Items 4, 5, and 6 have good value for Agent 6)

This allocation respects the constraints: each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [4, 5, 6]
}
```
