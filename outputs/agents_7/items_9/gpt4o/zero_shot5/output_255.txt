Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  83  71  76  40  77  78  68  73
1   2  65  44  30   2  67  97  45  87
2   7  28  43  52  75  44   7  45  91
3  41  40   3  45   9  38  85  14  64
4  42  76  66  57  92  65  78  84  67
5  30  34  24  92  47  38  31   6  90
6  46  99  18  54  93  17  32  83  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction or valuations of the agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (or as fairly as possible given the constraint of 9 items). We'll use a simple approach where we iterate over the items and assign them to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, ensuring each agent gets a reasonably fair share.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 85 by Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 99 by Agent 6.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 71 by Agent 0 (next highest is 66 by Agent 4, but Agent 0 gets priority here as per fairness).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 92 by Agent 5.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 93 by Agent 6.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 77 by Agent 0 (next highest is 67 by Agent 1, but Agent 0 gets priority here as per fairness).
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 97 by Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 84 by Agent 4.
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is 91 by Agent 2.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [1, 4]
}
```

Each agent has been fairly allocated based on the highest valuations, and all items have been distributed.
