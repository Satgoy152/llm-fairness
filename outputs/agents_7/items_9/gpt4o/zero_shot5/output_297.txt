Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78   2  12  46  21  74  87  40  31
1  39   5  56  76  25  78  30   0   3
2  58  33  55  97   6  42  79  25  82
3  44  98   8  76  99  55  34  91  26
4  44  82  56  42  41  83  38  77  62
5  55  75  97  83  52  41  41  83  47
6  93  27  54  98  19  18  12  96  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 27 54 98 19 18 12 96 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives items with a relatively balanced total value, considering their preferences. Here's a possible allocation that attempts to maintain fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocated items with high values for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocated items with high values for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocated items with high values for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocated items with high values for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocated items with high values for Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocated items with high values for Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: Allocated items with high values for Agent 6.

Given the table, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: 0, 5
- **Agent 1**: 3
- **Agent 2**: 8
- **Agent 3**: 1
- **Agent 4**: 7
- **Agent 5**: 2
- **Agent 6**: 4, 6

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [4, 6]
}
```
