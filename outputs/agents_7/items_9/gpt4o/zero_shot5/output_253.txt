Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  97  22  63   8  77  73   7  25
1  53  18  41  66  69  57  30  52  57
2  25  74  43  63  63  99  38  72  65
3  23   3  21  92  62  49  40  63   4
4  97  22  11  22  72  98   9   2  64
5   8  53  82  18  77  34  69  37  11
6   2   0   2  20  45  49  64  78  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We have 9 items and 7 agents. Since we have more items than agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring that all items are allocated and no agent receives more items than necessary:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are for items 1, 5, and 6. Let's allocate item 1.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are for items 4, 3, and 5. Let's allocate item 4.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuations are for items 5, 1, and 8. Let's allocate item 5.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuations are for items 3, 7, and 4. Let's allocate item 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest valuations are for items 0, 5, and 8. Let's allocate item 0.
6. **Agent 5:** Highest valuations are for items 2, 4, and 6. Let's allocate item 2.
7. **Agent 6:** Highest valuations are for items 7, 6, and 5. Let's allocate item 6.

Now, we have allocated 7 items. We have 2 more items left to allocate. The remaining items are 7 and 8.

- **Remaining allocations:**
  - Item 7: Allocate to Agent 6 (highest valuation for remaining items).
  - Item 8: Allocate to Agent 2 (highest valuation for remaining items).

This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [6, 7]
}
```
