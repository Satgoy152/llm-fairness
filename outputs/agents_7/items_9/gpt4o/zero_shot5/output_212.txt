Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  27  33  91  70  65  39   8  16
1  29  98  79  64  17  79  62  41  72
2  36  97  88  20   2  20  48  73  86
3  61  67  18  37  87  18  20  88  61
4  84   8  93  13  33  84  86  15  12
5  28  99   8   4  61   9  74  37   5
6  66   4  59  63  98  48   8  16  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, given that there are 9 items and 7 agents. At least two agents will receive two items, while the others will receive one item each.

We can prioritize allocating items based on the highest valuation by each agent, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item.
2. For the remaining items, allocate them to agents with the next highest valuations, ensuring a fair distribution.

Here's one way to do it:

- Agent 0: Items [3] (value 91, highest for agent 0)
- Agent 1: Items [1] (value 98, highest for agent 1)
- Agent 2: Items [2] (value 88, highest for agent 2)
- Agent 3: Items [7] (value 88, highest for agent 3)
- Agent 4: Items [0] (value 84, highest for agent 4)
- Agent 5: Items [5] (value 9, highest for agent 5)
- Agent 6: Items [4, 6, 8] (values 98, 8, and 32, with 98 being the highest available at that point)

By following this allocation strategy, we ensure each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4, 6, 8]
}
```
