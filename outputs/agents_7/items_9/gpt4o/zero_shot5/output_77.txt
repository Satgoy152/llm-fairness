Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  84  64  72  22  13  56  48  17
1   6  86  98  39  98  61  42  91  54
2  37  76  92  87  35  66  34  27  99
3  20  60  32  34  47  70  64  68  35
4  42  44  68  57  63  72   2  91  47
5  99  79  20  79  18  97  50  75  55
6  91  57   5  77  23  62  98  49  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to distribute them such that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items, considering their valuations. Since there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. 

Let's proceed with the allocations:

1. Assign the highest valued items to agents to maximize their total value.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 2: Items [8]
- Agent 3: Items [5]
- Agent 4: Items [7]
- Agent 5: Items [4]
- Agent 6: Items [6]

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [6]
}
```
