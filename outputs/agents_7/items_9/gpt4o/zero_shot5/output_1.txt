Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  43  99  60  25  90  11  99  77
1  40  45  13  67  16  13  52  54  58
2  28  25  55   2  56   9  46  31   9
3   8  58  68  73  68  39  42  49  25
4  17  36  22  30  16  92   8  58  94
5  25  21  96  26   1  55  31  54  46
6  60   2  37  51  62  35  94  89   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. One approach is to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring fairness and completeness in the allocation process.

Let's go through the items one by one and assign them to the agents who value them the most, considering the constraints:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 6 values it the most with 60.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most with 58.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most with 99.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most with 73.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 6 values it the most with 62.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most with 90.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 6 values it the most with 94.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most with 99.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 4 values it the most with 94.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item. Agent 0 already has more than one item, and Agent 6 also has multiple items. Agent 3 has two items. Agent 4 has one item. Agents 1, 2, and 5 are not allocated any items yet.

We need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness and that each agent gets at least one item. Let's make the adjustments:

- Move Item 1 from Agent 3 to Agent 1.
- Move Item 4 from Agent 6 to Agent 2.
- Move Item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 5.

With these adjustments, we ensure each agent has at least one item and exactly 9 items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total allocation is exactly 9 items.
