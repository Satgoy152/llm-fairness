Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  26  94  64   8   6  53   0  59
1  45  62  76  85  92  85  46  82  26
2  18  98  99  95  68  12  68  30  17
3  31  37  55  34  84  37  87   2  41
4  70  12  28  18  80  80  93   8  60
5   4  17  37  87  45  13  45  65  58
6  36  96  77  14  37   3  34  98  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items according to the agents' valuations. We'll try to give each agent items for which they have relatively high valuations while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's one potential allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (94).
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly (92).
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly (99), but it's already allocated to Agent 0, so we consider a different item.
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly (87).
- Agent 4 values item 6 highly (93), but it's already allocated to Agent 3, so we consider a different item.
- Agent 5 values item 3 highly (87).
- Agent 6 values item 7 highly (98).

Based on these observations, here is an allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [0]
- Agent 5: [3, 8]
- Agent 6: [7, 5]

These allocations attempt to maximize each agent's happiness based on their valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3, 8],
    "6": [7, 5]
}
```
