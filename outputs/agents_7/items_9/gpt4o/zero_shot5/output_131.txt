Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  43  22  22  95  89  19  97  19
1  41  86   8  26  74  36  77  53  74
2  94  32  27  22  26  28  56  96  23
3  64   5  72  43  14  50   1  87  66
4  41  68  53  11   1  20  47  76  83
5  60  63  20   1  69  13  42   0  67
6  66   3  35   2  76  60  63  15  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items and ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, while maximizing the overall satisfaction. Let's perform the allocation step by step:

1. **Determine the highest valued item for each agent:** This ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly.

2. **Allocate items based on individual highest valuations:**

    - Agent 0 values item 7 the most (value 97).
    - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (value 86).
    - Agent 2 values item 0 the most (value 94).
    - Agent 3 values item 8 the most (value 66).
    - Agent 4 values item 8 the most (value 83), but since item 8 is already taken, we look for the next highest available item, which is item 4 (value 1).
    - Agent 5 values item 0 the most (value 60), but since item 0 is already taken, we look for the next highest available item, which is item 4 (value 69).
    - Agent 6 values item 4 the most (value 76), but since item 4 is already taken, we look for the next highest available item, which is item 0 (value 66).

3. **Redistribute or allocate remaining items:**

   After the above step, some items will remain unallocated. We need to ensure that all 9 items are allocated.

   - Item 3 is not yet allocated. Agent 3 values item 3 at 43, which is the highest among those who haven't received a second item yet.
   - Item 5 is not yet allocated. Agent 0 values item 5 at 89, which is the highest among those who haven't received a second item yet.
   - Item 6 is not yet allocated. Agent 1 values item 6 at 77, which is the highest among those who haven't received a second item yet.
   - Item 2 is not yet allocated. Agent 3 values item 2 at 72, which is the highest among those who haven't received a third item yet.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [8, 3, 2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has been considered for their highest valued items, and all items have been fairly distributed among the agents.
