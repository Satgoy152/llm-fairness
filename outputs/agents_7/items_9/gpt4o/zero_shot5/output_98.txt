Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  72  60  51  29  82  62  22  90
1  29  85  53   0  82  30   1  21   3
2  19  38  77  94  25  39  98  40  98
3  84  84  44  92  94  31  24  65  10
4  77  88  43  43   2  47  39  59  43
5  14  86  96  38  30  23  66  64  41
6  78  83  83  51  46  23   8  68   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each gets at least one item if possible and all items are distributed. The goal is to have a balanced distribution based on the agents' valuations.

One possible allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 highly values item 8.
- Agent 1 highly values item 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 6.
- Agent 3 highly values item 3.
- Agent 4 highly values item 4.
- Agent 5 highly values item 2.
- Agent 6 highly values item 0.

After these initial allocations, we need to distribute the remaining items 5 and 7. We can assign these based on the next highest valuations from agents who have not yet received an item or who have lower total value from their current items.

Here's one possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2, 5],
    "6": [0]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 8, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives item 1, which they value the most.
- Agent 2 receives items 6 and 7, maximizing their valuation.
- Agent 3 receives item 3, which they highly value.
- Agent 4 receives item 4, which is the highest available.
- Agent 5 receives items 2 and 5, which maximizes their value.
- Agent 6 receives item 0, which is the highest value available to them.

This distribution attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, ensuring all items are allocated.
