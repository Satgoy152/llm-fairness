Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  49  58   1  82  80  23  46  94
1  91  71  22  16  14  41  51  66  44
2  26   6  76  76  50  68  83  77  81
3  33  48  25   7  49  46  10  26  79
4  67  58  63  87  12  50  93  62  87
5  70  33  14  19  85  16  49  89  62
6  76   3  61  38  60  18  10  79  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations provided in the table and distribute the items in a manner that optimizes total satisfaction across all agents. Each agent should receive at least one item, ensuring fairness in the distribution. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are on items 0, 4, and 8. Allocate item 8 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is on item 0, but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is on item 6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is on item 8, but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 1, but it's also allocated. Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are on items 3 and 8. Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is on item 4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is on item 0. Allocate item 0 to Agent 6.

Now, we have allocated 7 items, but need to allocate 2 more to ensure all 9 items are distributed.

8. **Revisit allocations**:
   - Item 2: Highest remaining valuation is Agent 0. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Highest remaining valuation is Agent 2. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

The allocations are now complete. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed among the 7 agents.
