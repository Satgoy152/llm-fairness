Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  43  14  29  37  31  12  17   5
1  83  70  84  86  66  79  96  32  66
2  74  67  64  11  53  24  74  91  31
3  77  39  80  13  78  75  85  81  68
4  62  11   6  97  17  78  39  81  20
5  51  62  49  66  24  89  87  91  14
6  77  75  87  56  98  84  37  67  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations of the items. The goal is to allocate items such that each agent gets a relatively fair share based on their valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated.

One way to approach this is to use a greedy algorithm that iteratively assigns items to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated. We'll ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible and that the distribution is as even as possible.

Here is a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Following these steps, here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 3
- Agent 5: Item 5
- Agent 6: Items 1, 4, 8

Now, I will present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1, 4, 8]
}
```
