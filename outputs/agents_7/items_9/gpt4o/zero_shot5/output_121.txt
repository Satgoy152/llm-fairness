Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  25  41  29   0  74  10  92   4
1  77  39   0  90   6  21  95  83  61
2  93  17  52  53  71  17  41  75  18
3   5  50  74   2  63  43  52  56  47
4  28  86  23  14  75  48  25  44  37
5  94  97  33  60  56  64  23  23  91
6  48  99  91  11  20  65   7  17  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider distributing them in a way that attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent. Given the table of values, a possible approach is to allocate items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 20) and item 3 (value 29).
2. Agent 1 gets item 7 (value 83).
3. Agent 2 gets item 2 (value 52).
4. Agent 3 gets item 6 (value 52) and item 8 (value 47).
5. Agent 4 gets item 4 (value 75).
6. Agent 5 gets item 1 (value 97).
7. Agent 6 gets item 5 (value 65).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and attempts to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6, 8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [5]
}
```
