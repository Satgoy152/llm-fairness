Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  93  94  23   9  56  41  31  69
1  18  85  13  33  64  86  59  85  51
2   9  60  44   7  89  83  36  58  27
3  68  19  66  63  72  30  57   7  54
4   5  78  90  60  18  41  12  66  55
5  94  85  84  30  90  99  57  65   1
6  26  51  80  63  29  58  93  27  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 7 agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on the provided values. Given that there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Here is a possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 2 (value 94).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 5 (value 86).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 4 (value 89).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is item 0 (value 68).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for Agent 4 is item 2 (value 90). However, since item 2 is already allocated, the next best is item 1 (value 78).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value item for Agent 5 is item 5 (value 99). However, since item 5 is already allocated, the next best is item 0 (value 94).
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value item for Agent 6 is item 6 (value 93).

This covers the highest values per agent, but we need to allocate all 9 items.

Let's adjust:

- **Agent 0**: [2]
- **Agent 1**: [5, 8]
- **Agent 2**: [4]
- **Agent 3**: [0]
- **Agent 4**: [1]
- **Agent 5**: [3]
- **Agent 6**: [6, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items fairly based on their highest valuations, while all items are allocated.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [6, 7]
}
```
