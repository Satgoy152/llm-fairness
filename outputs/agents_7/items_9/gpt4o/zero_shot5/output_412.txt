Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  55  78  46  59  95  30  11  72
1  56   7  84  86   7  59  57  38  49
2  59  91  11   9  82  71  48  94  32
3  22  69  17  33  65  41  80  65  41
4  81  59  98  36  67  17  27  56   1
5  61  55  26  37  23  65  55  78  61
6  92  83   5  46  31  39  49  20  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and that exactly 9 items are allocated in total. We can aim for maximizing the total valuation by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Below is the allocation based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 6 values it at 92.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 91.
3. Item 2: Agent 4 values it at 98.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 86.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 82.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 95.
7. Item 6: Agent 3 values it at 80.
8. Item 7: Agent 2 values it at 94.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 72.

Based on these allocations, here is the resulting JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each item going to the agent who values it the most.
