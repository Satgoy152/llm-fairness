Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84   4  66  25  44  36   5  69  92
1  53  33  95  48  39   3  41  44  22
2  61  32  78  35  42  46  56   6  79
3  89  26   0  79  62  71   7  55  27
4  42  75  70  24  56  18  36  78  34
5  71  68  24  43  84  95  92  78  13
6  95  25  75  95   4  47  55  45  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84  4 66 25 44 36  5 69 92]
 [53 33 95 48 39  3 41 44 22]
 [61 32 78 35 42 46 56  6 79]

 [95 25 75 95  4 47 55 45 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible, and distribute the 9 items in total.

Based on the valuations given, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 8
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 7
- Agent 5: Item 5
- Agent 6: Item 3
- Reassigning for maximum value while ensuring all items are allocated:
  - Agent 0: Item 8
  - Agent 1: Item 2
  - Agent 2: Item 6
  - Agent 3: Item 0
  - Agent 4: Item 7
  - Agent 5: Item 5
  - Agent 6: Items 3, 1, 4

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [3, 1, 4]
}
```
