Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  11  33  64  40  25  70  54  78
1  15  70  83  99  57   1  89  72  90
2  79  61  88  92  14  72  30  79  99
3  37  69  45  50  23  59  83  86  76
4  17  89  70   8  76  38  95  32  48
5  22  21  28  94  54  56  98  49  57
6  31   6  90  55  56  91  23  94  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items such that the overall allocation is as fair as possible. We'll aim to distribute the items based on the valuations provided, considering that we have 9 items and 7 agents.

Let's allocate the items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring fairness:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Valuations: [61, 11, 33, 64, 40, 25, 70, 54, 78]
   - Highest valued items: 8 (78), 6 (70)

2. Agent 1: 
   - Valuations: [15, 70, 83, 99, 57, 1, 89, 72, 90]
   - Highest valued items: 3 (99), 2 (83)

3. Agent 2: 
   - Valuations: [79, 61, 88, 92, 14, 72, 30, 79, 99]
   - Highest valued items: 8 (99), 3 (92)

4. Agent 3: 
   - Valuations: [37, 69, 45, 50, 23, 59, 83, 86, 76]
   - Highest valued items: 7 (86)

5. Agent 4: 
   - Valuations: [17, 89, 70, 8, 76, 38, 95, 32, 48]
   - Highest valued items: 6 (95), 1 (89)

6. Agent 5: 
   - Valuations: [22, 21, 28, 94, 54, 56, 98, 49, 57]
   - Highest valued items: 6 (98), 3 (94)

7. Agent 6: 
   - Valuations: [31, 6, 90, 55, 56, 91, 23, 94, 26]
   - Highest valued items: 7 (94), 5 (91)

Now, let's allocate:

- Agent 0: Items [8, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [3]
- Agent 2: Items [2]
- Agent 3: Items [7]
- Agent 4: Items [1]
- Agent 5: Items [5]
- Agent 6: Items [0]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and items are distributed based on the highest valuations while ensuring fairness.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0]
}
```
