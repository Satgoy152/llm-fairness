Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  73  71  91  26  87  55  67  40
1  62   5  50  49  34  84  97  40  54
2  14  92   5   3  27  42  85  97  29
3  29  70  85  72  87  25  86   1   2
4   9  40  95  49  59  44  36  45  76
5  32   4  94  74  34  38  49  45  14
6   9  93  69  43   4  55  93  10  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If any agent has more than one item, consider redistributing to agents with no items, if necessary, to ensure fairness in the number of items distributed.

Let's determine the maximum-valued agent for each item:

- Item 0 is most valued by Agent 0 (value 89).
- Item 1 is most valued by Agent 6 (value 93).
- Item 2 is most valued by Agent 4 (value 95).
- Item 3 is most valued by Agent 0 (value 91).
- Item 4 is most valued by Agent 3 (value 87).
- Item 5 is most valued by Agent 0 (value 87).
- Item 6 is most valued by Agent 1 (value 97).
- Item 7 is most valued by Agent 2 (value 97).
- Item 8 is most valued by Agent 4 (value 76).

Now, distribute the items based on the above valuations:

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [7]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [2, 8]
- Agent 5: []
- Agent 6: [1]

All agents except Agent 5 have received items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the requested json format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 8],
    "5": [],
    "6": [1]
}
```
