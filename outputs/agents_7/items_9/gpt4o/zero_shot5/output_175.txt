Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  43  82   9  53  54  74  14  62
1  63  59  54  77   1  96  98   5  86
2  77  80  64  60  65  42  44  46  24
3  55  85  78  17  79  61  62  15  29
4  89  28  77  76  47  12   9  85  43
5  68  22  43  52  83   2  54  51  11
6  90  57  23  41  92  98  36  53  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [90 57 23 41 92 98 36 53 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of items based on their valuations. A common approach is to aim for maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Considering the table and aiming for a balanced distribution, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 8]
- Agent 4: Item [7]
- Agent 5: No items
- Agent 6: No items

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents. Note that the allocation could vary depending on the strategy used (e.g., maximizing individual valuations, fairness criteria, etc.). Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```
