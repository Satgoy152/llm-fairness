Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  79  63  55  42  59  27  78  95
1  35  36  50  62  92  59  20  34  37
2  76   8   5  30  22  64  56  10  74
3  22   2  21  44  34  48  32  94  97
4  65  55  22   4   8  85  34  28  32
5  75  15  83   7  33  59  84  28  63
6  32  76  90  14  61  86  28  32  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple approach that ensures each agent gets an allocation and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. One way to do this is to assign each agent one item based on their highest valuation for that item. We will proceed by iteratively assigning items to agents based on the highest remaining valuations until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Agent 0 values item 8 the highest at 95.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 92.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 76.
4. Agent 3 values item 8 the highest at 97, but it's already taken, so we consider item 7 at 94.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 the highest at 85.
6. Agent 5 values item 2 the highest at 83.
7. Agent 6 values item 5 the highest at 86, but it's already taken, so we consider item 2 at 90 (which is also taken), and then item 1 at 76.

Now we need to assign the remaining items (3 and 6) to the agents with the next highest valuations:

- Agent 0 has item 3 valued at 55.
- Agent 5 has item 6 valued at 84.

Below is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2, 6],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that all 9 items are allocated.
