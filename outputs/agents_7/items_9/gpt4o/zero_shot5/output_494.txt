Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  41  27  95  90  85  87  98  75
1  15  16  92  34   7  88  13  54  77
2   7  76  86  65  77  48   8  67  55
3  27  14  57  29  93  26  81  54  81
4   8  89  39  10   7  76  89  12  41
5  23   1  71  65   0   3  19  45   6
6  95   9  87  73   8  83  39  67  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Given there are 7 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others. A reasonable approach is to first allocate one item to each agent and then distribute the remaining items based on the highest valuations.

Let's start the allocation process by assigning one item to each agent based on their highest valuation. After that, we will allocate the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

### Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (value 98).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (value 92).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (value 86). Since item 2 is already taken, we assign the next highest, item 4 (value 77).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (value 93). Since item 4 is already taken, we assign the next highest, item 6 (value 81).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 89).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (value 71). Since item 2 is already taken, we assign the next highest, item 3 (value 65).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value 95).

### Remaining Items:

The items that have been allocated so far are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. The remaining items are 5 and 8. 

Assign these items based on the next highest valuations:

- **Item 5**:
  - Agent 0: 85
  - Agent 1: 88 (highest)
  - Agent 2: 48
  - Agent 3: 26
  - Agent 4: 76
  - Agent 5: 3
  - Agent 6: 83
  
  Allocate item 5 to **Agent 1**.

- **Item 8**:
  - Agent 0: 75
  - Agent 1: 77
  - Agent 2: 55
  - Agent 3: 81 (highest)
  - Agent 4: 41
  - Agent 5: 6
  - Agent 6: 67

  Allocate item 8 to **Agent 3**.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6, 8],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
