Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  84  46  73  45  21  16  36  38
1  56  97  94  38  57  36   3  37  80
2  72  27  69  81  54  29  53  88  90
3  97  60  77  23  16  37  59  17  14
4  61  37  69  71   4  84  24  16  78
5  62  36  78  23  79  52  17  28  63
6  33  78  25  64  29  59  96  56  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to distribute the items such that each agent receives approximately the same total value based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Try to assign items to agents in a way that balances the total values each agent receives.
3. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that exactly 9 items are allocated in total.

Let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 66 + 84 + 46 + 73 + 45 + 21 + 16 + 36 + 38 = 425
- Agent 1: 56 + 97 + 94 + 38 + 57 + 36 + 3 + 37 + 80 = 498
- Agent 2: 72 + 27 + 69 + 81 + 54 + 29 + 53 + 88 + 90 = 563
- Agent 3: 97 + 60 + 77 + 23 + 16 + 37 + 59 + 17 + 14 = 400
- Agent 4: 61 + 37 + 69 + 71 + 4 + 84 + 24 + 16 + 78 = 444
- Agent 5: 62 + 36 + 78 + 23 + 79 + 52 + 17 + 28 + 63 = 438
- Agent 6: 33 + 78 + 25 + 64 + 29 + 59 + 96 + 56 + 96 = 536

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [0, 1] (Value: 66 + 84 = 150)
- Agent 1: [2, 8] (Value: 94 + 80 = 174)
- Agent 2: [3, 7] (Value: 81 + 88 = 169)
- Agent 3: [4] (Value: 16)
- Agent 4: [5] (Value: 84)
- Agent 5: [6] (Value: 17)
- Agent 6: [] (No items)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, though exact fairness in terms of value balance might not be achievable due to the limited number of items and varying valuations.
