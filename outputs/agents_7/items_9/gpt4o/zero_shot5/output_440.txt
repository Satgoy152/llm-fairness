Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  35  33  36  62  88  15   8  26
1  48  29   0  96  23  66  89  48  89
2  33  42  50  17  36  13  25  48  27
3  15  74  44  37  95  25  88  96  24
4  69  74  95  69  14  57   6  73   9
5  88  51  37  47  17  98  30  57  42
6  95  15  43  64  62  94  46  91  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One common way to approach this problem is by utilizing a method that attempts to maximize overall satisfaction or total valuation, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the table of valuations, let's distribute the items based on each agent's preferences, ensuring that all 9 items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are for items 0 and 5.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are for items 3 and 8.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuation is for item 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuations are for items 7 and 4.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest valuation is for item 2. However, item 2 is already allocated to Agent 2, so we look for the next highest, such as item 1.
6. **Agent 5:** Highest valuation is for item 5, but it's already allocated to Agent 0. We look for the next highest, such as item 6.
7. **Agent 6:** Highest valuation is for item 0, but it's already allocated to Agent 0. We look for the next highest, such as item 4.

### Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 8
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Item 6
- Agent 6: Item 4

Now, let's format this allocation into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation respects their valuation preferences as closely as possible.
