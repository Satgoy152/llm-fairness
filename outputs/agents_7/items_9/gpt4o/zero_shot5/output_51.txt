Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  16  28  80   4  31  61   0  80
1  37  81  66  11  70  11  55  24  28
2  95  86  56  61  16  98   4  45  58
3  21  66  68  22  71  54  15  93  77
4   4  29  60  32  56  46  82   4  18
5  55   2  66  33  34  98   5  64  73
6  14   5  36  17  46  20  42  87  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share while considering their valuations. This doesn't necessarily mean each agent gets the same number of items, but rather that the distribution takes into account maximizing overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. Let's go through the table and make a distribution:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 highly with 96 and item 3 with 80.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 highly with 81 and item 4 with 70.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 highly with 98.
4. **Agent 3** values item 7 highly with 93.
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 highly with 82.
6. **Agent 5** values item 8 highly with 73.
7. **Agent 6** has lower valuations overall, but item 8 has a relatively higher value with 80.

Based on these observations, we can attempt a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3] (96, 80)
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4] (81, 70)
- Agent 2: Item [5] (98)
- Agent 3: Item [7] (93)
- Agent 4: Item [6] (82)
- Agent 5: Item [8] (73)
- Agent 6: No items

This allocation tries to give each agent a high-value item based on their preferences. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [8],
    "6": []
}
```
