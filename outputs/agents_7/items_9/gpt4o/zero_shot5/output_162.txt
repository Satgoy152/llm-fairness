Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  50  55  83  41  73  89  89  75
1  34  72   6  87  10  80  61  56  51
2  48  48  78  20  97   2  92  50  69
3  52  79  96  82  54   0  59  95  58
4  36  58  89  10  93   8  63  16  28
5  84   8  95  13  75  61  49  75  87
6  32  47  38  43  52  65   6  37  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are more items than agents, some agents will receive more than one item, but we'll strive for a balanced distribution.

One approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations expressed by each agent for the items. We start by sorting each agent's valuation in descending order and allocating the highest valued items first to ensure fairness:

1. Agent 0: Highest valuations are for items 6 (89) and 7 (89).
2. Agent 1: Highest valuations are for items 3 (87) and 1 (72).
3. Agent 2: Highest valuations are for items 4 (97) and 6 (92).
4. Agent 3: Highest valuations are for items 2 (96) and 7 (95).
5. Agent 4: Highest valuations are for items 2 (89) and 4 (93).
6. Agent 5: Highest valuations are for items 0 (84) and 8 (87).
7. Agent 6: Highest valuations are for items 5 (65) and 4 (52).

Now, we proceed with allocation ensuring each item is assigned to one agent only, prioritizing higher valuations. If there are conflicts (multiple agents valuing the same item highly), we can resolve them by considering the next highest valued item for those agents.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 6 and 7.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.
- Agent 3 receives item 2.
- Agent 4 receives item 1.
- Agent 5 receives items 0 and 8.
- Agent 6 receives item 5.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0, 8],
    "6": [5]
}
```
