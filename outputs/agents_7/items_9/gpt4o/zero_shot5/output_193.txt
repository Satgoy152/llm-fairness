Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  78  96  13  97  96   2  60  32
1  89  69   7   6  86  98  23  75   8
2  89   2  75  84  89  36  22  88  98
3  85  49  72  76   9  44  30  10  23
4  57  45  66  90   2  19  37   2  66
5  43  68  17  29  13  82  42  68  87
6   9  89  41  27  60  35  88  53  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 9 89 41 27 60 35 88 53 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all items are allocated. Given that there are 7 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more than one item while others may receive none. Let's aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation.

One possible approach is to assign items based on the highest valuations for each item. Let me proceed with that approach:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (89)
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 6 (89)
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (96)
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (90)
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (97)
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (98)
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 6 (88)
8. **Item 7**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (88)
9. **Item 8**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (98)

Now, let's make sure each agent gets an integer number of items and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5
- Agent 2: Items 7, 8
- Agent 3: (No items)
- Agent 4: Item 3
- Agent 5: (No items)
- Agent 6: Items 1, 6

This allocation ensures all items are assigned, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [],
    "6": [1, 6]
}
```
