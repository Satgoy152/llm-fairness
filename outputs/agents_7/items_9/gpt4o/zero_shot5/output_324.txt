Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3   3  29  52  20   7  41  36  38
1  74  34  56  97  48   9  78  97  91
2   6  20  61  45  41   0  28  73  46
3  92  65  57  27  33  89  65  73  49
4  46  55  30   7  39  84  54  37  72
5  68  51  40  71  24  31  70  39   6
6  81  15  87  67  99  13  82  13  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [81 15 87 67 99 13 82 13 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A straightforward way to approach this is by maximizing the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives item 3 (value 52)
2. **Agent 1**: Receives item 1 (value 34) and item 7 (value 97)
3. **Agent 2**: Receives item 2 (value 61) and item 8 (value 46)
4. **Agent 3**: Receives item 0 (value 92)
5. **Agent 4**: Receives item 5 (value 84)
6. **Agent 5**: Receives item 6 (value 70)
7. **Agent 6**: Receives item 4 (value 99)

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and the overall valuation is considered.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [4]
}
```
