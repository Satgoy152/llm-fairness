Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  28  39  23  26  21  17  76  69
1  25  13  90  55  13  19  50  53  66
2  21  37  97  46  98  52  42   8  82
3  16  59   6  19  53  93  83  31  21
4  95  21  19   0  39  52  12  24  11
5  31  17  75   1  84  80  69  58  73
6  75  23  77  57  61  97  42   2  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents based on the valuations provided, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that every item is allocated. Here is a possible allocation strategy that considers the high valuations for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1] - These items have relatively higher values for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Item [2] - Agent 1 highly values item 2.

3. **Agent 2**: Item [4] - Agent 2 highly values item 4.

4. **Agent 3**: Item [5] - Agent 3 highly values item 5.

5. **Agent 4**: Items [7, 8] - These items have relatively higher values for Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Item [6] - Agent 5 has a relatively higher valuation for item 6.

7. **Agent 6**: Item [3] - Agent 6 has a relatively higher valuation for item 3.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item where feasible. Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7, 8],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [3]
}
```
