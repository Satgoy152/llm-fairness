Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4   7   8  74  19  41  14  56   7
1  35  53  66  67  74  53  82  42  13
2  44  29  18  11  57  66  76  90   1
3  82  22  89  96  69  83  10  78  56
4  72  62  37  65  46  34  14  17  30
5  93  63  48  93  59  16  96  13  72
6  13  88  48  84  56  64  33  12   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. We'll aim for a balanced distribution, considering both individual preferences and the overall spread of values to minimize envy and maximize fairness.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest value for each item and allocate it to the corresponding agent.
2. Attempt to balance the total values received by each agent.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0** is most valued by Agent 5 (value 93).
- **Item 1** is most valued by Agent 6 (value 88).
- **Item 2** is most valued by Agent 3 (value 89).
- **Item 3** is most valued by Agent 3 (value 96).
- **Item 4** is most valued by Agent 1 (value 74).
- **Item 5** is most valued by Agent 3 (value 83).
- **Item 6** is most valued by Agent 5 (value 96).
- **Item 7** is most valued by Agent 2 (value 90).
- **Item 8** is most valued by Agent 5 (value 72).

Let's review the allocations to ensure fairness and balance:

- Agent 0: No items, needs to be considered.
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Items 2, 3, 5
- Agent 4: No items, needs to be considered.
- Agent 5: Items 0, 6, 8
- Agent 6: Item 1

Given the above allocations, agents 0 and 4 have not received any items. We may need to adjust the allocations to ensure that every agent receives at least one item. Let's reallocate:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (moved from Agent 3)
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Items 3, 5
- Agent 4: Item 8 (moved from Agent 5)
- Agent 5: Items 0, 6
- Agent 6: Item 1

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [0, 6],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item, with an emphasis on maximizing total valuations and minimizing envy.
