Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  71  82  96  85  90  58  91  30
1  77  27  41  51  57  33  35  61  14
2  67  84  76  90  18  85  17  37   0
3  79  41  66  53  33  74  58  80  85
4  45  57  38   3  12  40   1  47   8
5  94  10  70  86  16  87  87  20  18
6  53  21  89  65  41  32  11   3  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and the total value or utility is maximized, subject to fairness. Given the constraints of the problem, here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (value 96).
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (value 77).
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (value 84).
4. Agent 3 values item 8 the highest (value 85).
5. Agent 4 values item 7 the highest (value 47).
6. Agent 5 values item 5 the highest (value 87).
7. Agent 6 values item 2 the highest (value 89).

Since each agent is allocated one item they value the most, we have allocated 7 items so far. We need to allocate 2 more items to complete the allocation of 9 items in total. We can allocate these remaining items based on the next highest valuations or to agents who have lower total valuations. For simplicity, let's allocate:

- Agent 0 also gets item 4 (value 85) since it has the next highest value for this agent.
- Agent 1 also gets item 6 (value 35) since it is the next highest value for this agent.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives items they value highly.
