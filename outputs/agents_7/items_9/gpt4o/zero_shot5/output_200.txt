Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40   0  79  71  81  84  11  72  49
1  93  26  12   4  29  36  84  65  73
2  53  39  61  59  88  90  33  18  76
3  75  43  61   1  67  35  82  16  43
4  74  22  21  98  12  22  37  92   5
5   3  35  75  21  17  97  71  15  63
6  20  45  81  57  51  64  56  75  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can attempt to distribute them based on the agents' valuations, ensuring that no agent is left out and that all items are allocated. Since each agent values items differently, a balanced approach could be to assign items to agents in a way that maximizes their individual total value while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item while considering their preferences as reflected in their valuations.
