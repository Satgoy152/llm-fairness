Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  76  43  22  16   5  73  75  79
1  36  44  14  33  88  74  58  89  10
2  34  90  50  41  61   0  12  43  32
3  33  59  54  91  65  74  62  39  61
4  65  86  19   2  49  35  54   6  78
5  16  12  58  40  77  55  28  16  18
6  77  88  69  73  23  24  87  71  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Let's examine the valuation table and distribute the items accordingly.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly (87), which is the highest valuation for this agent.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 highly (89), which is the highest valuation for this agent.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 highly (90), which is the highest valuation for this agent.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 highly (91), which is the highest valuation for this agent.
5. Agent 4 values item 8 highly (78), which is the highest valuation for this agent.
6. Agent 5 values item 4 highly (77), which is the highest valuation for this agent.
7. Agent 6 values item 6 highly (87), which is the highest valuation for this agent.

Now, we have allocated 7 items to 7 agents. We still need to allocate 2 more items.

- Agent 0 can also receive item 8 (79).
- Agent 3 can also receive item 5 (74).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total valuation based on the highest preferences from each agent.
