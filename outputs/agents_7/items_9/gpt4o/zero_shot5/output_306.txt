Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  35  12  40  39  36  17  73  89
1  10  65  58  68  38  68  55  40  98
2  35   6  51  80  39  80  67  12  88
3  22  38  53  36   0  31  62  30  76
4  73  68  80  63  74   1  42  60   0
5  55   4  80  24  46  92  84  40  93
6  10  79   7  94   4  37  73  25  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I'll aim to distribute items in a way that considers each agent's preferences as represented by the given valuations. We will ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated equals 9.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 8 (89), 7 (73), and 3 (40).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value items are 8 (98), 1 (65), and 3 (68).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value items are 3 (80), 5 (80), and 8 (88).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value items are 8 (76), 2 (53), and 6 (62).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value items are 2 (80), 0 (73), and 4 (74).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value items are 5 (92), 8 (93), and 6 (84).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value items are 3 (94), 1 (79), and 6 (73).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 7 (73) and item 0 (41) for a total of 2 items.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 8 (98) for a total of 1 item.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3 (80) for a total of 1 item.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 6 (62) for a total of 1 item.
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 2 (80) for a total of 1 item.
- **Agent 5**: Allocate item 5 (92) for a total of 1 item.
- **Agent 6**: Allocate item 1 (79) and item 4 (4) for a total of 2 items.

This ensures each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1, 4]
}
```
