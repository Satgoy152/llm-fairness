Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  78   2  23  20  35  13  27  69
1  14   5  63   3  64   5  37  34  83
2   5  65  26  33  35  84  20  10  64
3   4   5  69   2  93  84   1  41  21
4  11  54  18  36  68  21   9  57  57
5  42  97  82  65  62  91  43  62  68
6  54  92  72   4  71  76  34  12  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. A common approach to this problem is to maximize the total value of the allocation while ensuring fairness. One way to achieve this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how it can be done for this particular situation:

1. **Evaluate each item's highest value:** For each item, find which agent values the item the most.
2. **Allocate items accordingly:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's the breakdown:

- Item 0: Agent 6 values it the most (54).
- Item 1: Agent 5 values it the most (97).
- Item 2: Agent 5 values it the most (82).
- Item 3: Agent 5 values it the most (65).
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most (93).
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most (84).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most (37).
- Item 7: Agent 4 values it the most (57).
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it the most (83).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1, 2, 3],
    "6": [0]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated items based on the highest valuation strategy, ensuring all 9 items are distributed among them.
