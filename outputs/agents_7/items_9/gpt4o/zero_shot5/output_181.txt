Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  63  18   5  56  28  28  99  28
1  16  55  23  47   0  13  73  81  87
2  42  32   2  90  16  12   7  59  60
3  38  96  56  56  56  62  90  50  36
4  10  92  14  47  54  41   3  62  55
5  74  69  26  89  86  16  78  98  41
6  78  62  80  47  71  57  65  39  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to distribute the total number of items (9 in this case) in a manner that attempts to maximize overall satisfaction. Given the table of valuations, we can use a simple strategy to assign items by trying to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 7 to agent 0, who values it at 99.
2. Assign item 5 to agent 3, who values it at 62.
3. Assign item 8 to agent 1, who values it at 87.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2, who values it at 90.
5. Assign item 1 to agent 4, who values it at 92.
6. Assign item 6 to agent 5, who values it at 78.
7. Assign item 0 to agent 6, who values it at 78.
8. Assign item 4 to agent 5, who values it at 86.
9. Assign item 2 to agent 6, who values it at 80.

This approach attempts to allocate items where they are most valued, resulting in a fair distribution based on preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6, 4],
    "6": [0, 2]
}
```
