Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  68  16  13  98   4   1   3  35
1  42  51  59  92  94  52  21   4  59
2  68   4  43  42  92  23  95  87  91
3  80  68   4  12  31  35  65  81  89
4  54  45  50  78  15  28  83  71   8
5  54  90  98  97  77  71  24  46  79
6  38  28  36  66  64  34  23   8  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple method where we distribute the items based on the highest valuations given by each agent for individual items. This way, each item goes to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. Look at each item and identify which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Continue this process until all items are distributed.

Let's perform this allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most at 80.
- Item 1: Agent 5 values it the most at 90.
- Item 2: Agent 5 values it the most at 98.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 92.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 98.
- Item 5: Agent 5 values it the most at 71.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 87.
- Item 8: Agent 2 values it the most at 91.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 7, 8],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 2, 5],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed to the agents who value them the most, thereby maintaining fairness in terms of valuations.
