Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  39  79  32  98  21  21  25  35
1  64  76   9   2  97  97  14  87  98
2  19  89  88   7  62  87  33  90  54
3  71  34  67  12   3   0  11  49  39
4  33  23  94  75  28  71  22  56  54
5  39  16  12   9  35  34   3  29  39
6  89  75  72  81  36  58  28  51  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple round-robin method based on the agents' valuation of each item. We'll iterate over each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item, where possible.

Here is a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0 is assigned to Agent 6 (value: 89)
2. Item 1 is assigned to Agent 2 (value: 89)
3. Item 2 is assigned to Agent 4 (value: 94)
4. Item 3 is assigned to Agent 6 (value: 81)
5. Item 4 is assigned to Agent 0 (value: 98)
6. Item 5 is assigned to Agent 1 (value: 97)
7. Item 6 is assigned to Agent 2 (value: 33)
8. Item 7 is assigned to Agent 1 (value: 87)
9. Item 8 is assigned to Agent 1 (value: 98)

With these allocations, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most.

The final allocations in the required JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5, 7, 8],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0, 3]
}
```
