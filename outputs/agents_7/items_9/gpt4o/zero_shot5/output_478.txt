Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  24  30  64  12  31  38  17  55
1  39  18  13  98  84   8  61  88  87
2  68  49  55   0  79  78  85  53  50
3  90  30  82   5  37  53  43  34  41
4   1  19  38  28  40   6  17  71  57
5  67   5  69  43  41  81  53  98  30
6   3   7  40  99  66  47  92  91  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations, keeping in mind that each agent can receive an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy maximizing each agent's value for the items they receive:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 0, 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 3, 7, 8.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 6, 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 0, 2.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 7, 8.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuations are for items 5, 7.
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuations are for items 3, 6.

Let's allocate the items to maximize fairness while ensuring all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0** gets item 0 (value 80)
- **Agent 1** gets item 3 (value 98)
- **Agent 2** gets item 6 (value 85)
- **Agent 3** gets item 2 (value 82)
- **Agent 4** gets item 7 (value 71)
- **Agent 5** gets item 5 (value 81)
- **Agent 6** gets item 4 (value 66)
- Assign remaining items (1 and 8) to maximize fairness:
  - **Agent 1** gets item 1 (value 18)
  - **Agent 6** gets item 8 (value 67)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4, 8]
}
```
