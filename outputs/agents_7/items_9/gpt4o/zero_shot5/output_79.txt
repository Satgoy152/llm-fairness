Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  75  61  16  39  11  17  27  84
1  45  63   9  26  81  49  33  61  77
2   0  41  70  80  85  80  55  54  55
3  41  86  75  61  58   9  52  14  51
4   4  86  52  30   1  85  58  71  92
5  88  81  64  34  88  28  90   9  28
6  54   2  18  73  90  51  97  15  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we'll try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (except if it's not possible due to the number of items being less than the number of agents) and all items are allocated.

Given there are 7 agents and 9 items, one approach is to assign the highest-valued items to each agent in order of their preference, ensuring that the total allocation is fair and maximizes the agents' satisfaction.

Here's one way to allocate the items fairly:

1. Agent 0 gets item 8 (value 84).
2. Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 81).
3. Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 80).
4. Agent 3 gets item 1 (value 86).
5. Agent 4 gets item 5 (value 85).
6. Agent 5 gets item 6 (value 90).
7. Agent 6 gets item 2 (value 18).

Since there are still 2 items left (0 and 7), we can assign these based on the next highest preference of any agent:

8. Agent 5 also receives item 0 (value 88).
9. Agent 4 also receives item 7 (value 71).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 9. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 7],
    "5": [6, 0],
    "6": [2]
}
```
