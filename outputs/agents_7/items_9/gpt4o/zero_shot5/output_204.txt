Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  35   8  35  57   1  16  19  45
1  50   0  88  40  24   1  93   8  29
2  92  36  46   2   6  29  21  68  52
3  98  11  58  98  88   0  67  19  18
4  62   6  68  14  43  51  51  24  18
5  11  41  27  90  45  29  70  73  78
6  98  11  21  69  37   1  25  93   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items based on each agent's preferences and values for the items. This will involve examining the valuation table and attempting to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. We will ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (57).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (88).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (92).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (98).
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most, but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 5 (51).
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most, but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 8 (78).
- Agent 6 values item 0 the most, but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 7 (93).

Now that we have assigned one item based on the highest available value for each agent, we need to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's distribute the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can take item 1 (35), which is the next highest available value for them.
- Agent 1 can take item 6 (93), which is the next highest available value for them.
- Items 9 and 10 don't exist, so we need to ensure only valid allocations.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.
