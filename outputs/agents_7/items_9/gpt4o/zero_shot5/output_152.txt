Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  26  56  89  49  34  79  99  38
1  72  10  67  59  88  80  84  89  20
2   2  89  70   9  18  64  95  14  69
3  79  40  91  47  30  54   7  18  69
4  28  41  53  49  95  59  13  81  14
5  68  94  53  81  87  14  33  80  65
6  90  74  61  14  34  56  49  17  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (except when not possible due to fewer items than agents). Let's consider the valuations and distribute the items to optimize overall satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values are for items 3 and 7. Let's assign item 7 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest values are for items 4 and 5. Let's assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest values are for items 6 and 2. Let's assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest values are for items 2 and 0. Let's assign item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 4, but it's already taken. Next is item 5. Let's assign item 5 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value is for item 1. Let's assign item 1 to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: The highest values are for items 8 and 0. Let's assign item 8 to Agent 6.

Now, we have assigned 7 items. Two items (0 and 3) are still unallocated. Let's assign them to the agents with the next highest available valuations:

8. **Agent 0**: Assign item 3 (second-highest unallocated).
9. **Agent 6**: Assign item 0 (highest unallocated).

The allocations based on this strategy are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [8, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the agents, maximizing their individual valuations as fairly as possible given the constraints.
