Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  33  76  62  60  16  88  26  49
1  25  59   7  28  17  21  97  79  14
2  76  13  42  65  41  90  93  13  13
3  95  35  17  44  12  74  74  91  61
4  39  87  66  84   4  86  37  14  47
5  37  13  74  28  93  81  67  53  85
6  61  80  83  82  72  71  81  66  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. We will try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item where feasible and distribute the remaining items based on maximizing their valuation. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. First, allocate one item to each agent with the highest value for that agent to ensure everyone gets at least one item.
2. Distribute the remaining items to maximize the total valuation.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most at 88.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most at 97, but since it's taken, we look at item 7, valued at 79.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most at 90.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most at 95.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most at 87.
- Agent 5 values item 4 the most at 93.
- Agent 6 values item 2 the most at 83.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items:

- Items 3 and 8 are not yet allocated. Agent 3 values item 8 highly at 61, so we give item 8 to Agent 3.
- Item 3 is given to Agent 6, who values it at 82.

This allocation ensures all items are assigned and maximizes the value each agent can receive based on their preferences. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 8],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the 7 agents, with each agent receiving items to maximize their satisfaction based on the given valuations.
