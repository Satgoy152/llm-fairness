Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  53  36  32  32  77  34  47   9
1  83   0  60  60  59  33  52  21  65
2  39  91  56  93  11  63  78  24  29
3  70  69  96  38   5  88  81  58  69
4  55   9  30  76  43  78  46  41  97
5  85  32  20  95  94  77  30  29  57
6  13   0  97  97  19  86  95   7  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total utility while ensuring each agent receives at least some value. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that considers the agents' valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 0, 5, and 7.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 and 8.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 8 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 6 values items 2 and 3 the most.

Based on these considerations, a fair allocation could look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6, 7, 1, 4]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 0 gets item 0, which they value decently.
- Agent 1 gets item 8, which they value the most.
- Agent 2 gets item 3, which they value the most.
- Agent 3 gets item 2, which they value the most.
- Agent 4 unfortunately doesn't get any items in this allocation to maximize others' satisfaction.
- Agent 5 gets item 5, which is one of the higher values for them.
- Agent 6 gets items 6, 7, 1, and 4, which balances out remaining items with relatively higher values.

This allocation aims to distribute the items to maximize total satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
