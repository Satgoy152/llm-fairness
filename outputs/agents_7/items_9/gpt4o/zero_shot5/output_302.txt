Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  70  96  25  50  95  90  29  43
1  78  91  50  25  10  32   7  36  31
2  19  61  39  76  25  51  57  34  85
3  38  45  15  53  51  45   3  95  80
4  41  36  36  57  64  67  21  12  69
5  54  45  85  37   3  87  35  87  43
6  64  14   1  59  70  35  64  50  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while making sure each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with a fair allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 and 5. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 8. Assign item 8 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 7. Assign item 7 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** has a high valuation for item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6** has a high valuation for item 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 6.
8. We have assigned 7 items, and two more items remain: items 0 and 3. 

Since Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 0 among unassigned items, give item 0 to Agent 0.

Finally, allocate item 3 to Agent 2, as this will balance the allocation and provide Agent 2 with another item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [8, 3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [4]
}
```
