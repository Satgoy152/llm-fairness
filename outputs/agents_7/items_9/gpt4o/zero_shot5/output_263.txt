Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  78  16  30  24  48  75  25  59
1  47  45  83  42  14  31  63  13  52
2  93  74  45  58  80  64  92  70   8
3  37  76  44  89  72  89  44  96  94
4  14  57  19   7  67  26  64  55  51
5  33  84  95  19  59  58  24  21  87
6  37  16   7   5  44  64  41  53  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations provided in the table. The goal is to distribute the nine items among the seven agents such that the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences**: Assign items based on the highest value preferences for each agent to maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets a Fair Share**: Since there are more agents than items, some agents will not receive any items. We will try to distribute items such that the overall value each agent receives is balanced.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 6 (Valuation: 75)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (Valuation: 83)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (Valuation: 93)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (Valuation: 96)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (Valuation: 67)
- Agent 5: Item 8 (Valuation: 87)
- Agent 6: Item 5 (Valuation: 64)

Now, we still have two more items (1 and 3) to allocate:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 5 (Valuation: 84)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3 (Valuation: 89)

With this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and we have distributed all nine items.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7, 3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [8, 1],
    "6": [5]
}
```
