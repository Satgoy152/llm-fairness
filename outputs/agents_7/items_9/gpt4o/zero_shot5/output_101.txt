Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  49  14  65  60  93  87  88  17
1  86  12  11  16  33  82  52  38  56
2  95  16  48  48  99  31  96  81  69
3  22  45  17  61  39  73   2  21  67
4  82  49  53  38  50  41  84  15  33
5  74  75   0  30  68  42  35  97  73
6  95  99  98  47  86  65  50  18  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (93).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (86).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (99).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (73). Since item 5 is taken, the next highest is item 3 (61).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (84).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (97).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (99).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

8. **Agent 3**: Already has item 3, so we will not assign another item.
9. **Agent 0**: Next highest valuation is item 7 (88), which is not taken.

Now, let's check if all items are allocated:

- Items assigned: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Remaining items: 2, 8

Let's allocate the remaining items based on the remaining agents' next best valuations.

10. **Agent 2**: Already has item 4, next highest for item 2 (48).
11. **Agent 5**: Already has item 7, next highest for item 8 (73).

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [1]
}
```

All items are allocated, and every agent has been considered in the allocation process.
