Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  40  81  35  77  87  86  90  68
1  95  65  14  80  35  41  11   0  38
2  47  61   6  95  17  51  70  66  17
3  49  47  91  46  37  39  27  10  69
4  70  89  97  72  91  11  72  50  16
5  33   9  76  76  27  49  16  20  45
6  98   5  41  91  49  47  93  14  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's preference for each item and aim to maximize overall satisfaction. We can achieve this by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item by reallocating items if necessary.

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Item 0: Agent 6 values it the most with 98.
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most with 89.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most with 97.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most with 95.
- Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most with 91.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most with 87.
- Item 6: Agent 6 values it the most with 93.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most with 90.
- Item 8: Agent 6 values it the most with 82.

After making sure each agent gets at least one item, the allocation can be adjusted as follows:

- Agent 0: [5, 7]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [8]
- Agent 4: [2, 4]
- Agent 5: [0]
- Agent 6: [6]

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [2, 4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6]
}
```
