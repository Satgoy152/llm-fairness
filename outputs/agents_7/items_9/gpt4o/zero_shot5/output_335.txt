Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  53  99  12   7  61  20   6  85
1   5   5  59  18   2  72  50  16  72
2  49   8   3  81  48  13  14  85  44
3  33  63  55  72  98  46  97  52  28
4  44  76  22  59   6  88  78  72  87
5  44  31  58  98  23  19  77  66  50
6   2  14  64  95  53  93  34  10  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We aim to distribute the items to maximize the total value each agent receives, based on their valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (99), Item 0 (86), Item 8 (85)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (72), Item 8 (72), Item 2 (59)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (85), Item 3 (81), Item 0 (49)
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (98), Item 6 (97), Item 3 (72)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (88), Item 8 (87), Item 7 (72)
   - Allocate Item 8 to Agent 4

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (98), Item 6 (77), Item 2 (58)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 5

7. **Agent 6**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (93), Item 3 (95), Item 2 (64)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 6

Now we need to ensure all items are allocated and no agent receives more than one item, as we started with a single allocation per agent for simplicity. Items left are 0, 1, and 7, and agents with fewer allocations can receive them. 

Final allocation based on maximizing value:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [6],
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1]
}
```

Note: The allocation above assumes that items are allocated to maximize individual agent's value while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed. Adjustments are made to fit the condition of using all 9 items.
