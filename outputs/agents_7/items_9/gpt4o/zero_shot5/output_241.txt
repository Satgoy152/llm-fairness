Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  66  67  64  71  77  20  65  63
1  59  34  11  99  42  27  68  78  18
2  92  89  11  66  93  98  22  70  55
3  16   1  60  15  14  11  30  54  39
4  66  52  91  70  14  63  82  80  56
5  11  18  33  11  43  40   2  98  80
6  14   4  14  67  87  76   5  61  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we aim to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent. Let's follow a strategy to ensure fairness and maximize the overall satisfaction:

1. **Calculate the Total Valuation for Each Agent:** Sum up the values each agent assigns to all the items.

2. **Prioritize Assignment Based on Highest Valuation:** Assign items to agents based on their preferences, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Ensure Fairness:** If some agents have not received an item, ensure they get the items with the least impact on other agents' highest preferences.

4. **Allocate Items:**
   - Agent 2 has very high valuations and should be prioritized for items they value highly.
   - Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 3.
   - Distribute remaining items among agents with lower allocations.

Following this strategy, here's a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance agents' preferences, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and maximizing the overall satisfaction.
