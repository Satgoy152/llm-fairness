Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  85  45  11  91  36  24  53  21
1  60   8   0  68  94  55  61  24   4
2   4  39  97  29  37  38  83  22  91
3   9  63  39  99  79  76  38   8  53
4  57  34  72  19  20  55  91  86  74
5  48  96  85  90  83  86  78  78  96
6   8  57  65  64  34  67  63  87  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Since there are 9 items and 7 agents, not all agents will receive an item. We will try to allocate items to maximize the overall satisfaction or value each agent receives.

Let's start by allocating the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (91).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (94), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 3 (68).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (97).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (99), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 5 (76).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (91).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (96).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (87).

Now, we will allocate the remaining items:

- Item 0: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 1 (60), but Agent 1 already has an allocation (item 3). Next is Agent 4 (57), but Agent 4 also has an allocation (item 6). Next is Agent 5 (48), who has item 1, but we can give Agent 5 another item as they have a high valuation for this item.
- Item 8: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 2 (91), but Agent 2 already has an allocation (item 2). Next highest is Agent 4 (74), who has item 6, but we can give Agent 4 another item since they have a high valuation for this item.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6, 8],
    "5": [1, 0],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one high-value item, and all items are allocated. 

Note: There are multiple ways to allocate items fairly, and this is one possible approach based on maximizing valuations while ensuring allocations are fair.
