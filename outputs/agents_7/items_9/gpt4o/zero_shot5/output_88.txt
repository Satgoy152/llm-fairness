Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  27  17  33  57  56  59  14  93
1  13  98  35   8  71  83  50  23  96
2  36  51  25  18  21  60  48  95  24
3  79  78  21   4  31  38  69   1  84
4  49  37  18  50  21  13  93  75  30
5  25  28   1  63  64  45   1  83  16
6  73  39  80   2  10  34  38  73  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. Given that there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. We'll try to allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed. Below is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has relatively high values for items 4, 5, and 6.
2. Agent 1 has very high values for items 1 and 8.
3. Agent 2 has a high value for item 7.
4. Agent 3 has a high value for item 0.
5. Agent 4 has a high value for item 6.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 highly.
7. Agent 6 has high values for item 2.

By considering the highest valuations for each agent, here's a potential allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item with a high personal valuation, and all items are distributed.
