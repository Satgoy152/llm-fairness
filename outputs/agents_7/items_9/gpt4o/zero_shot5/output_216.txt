Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  48  88  73  87  60  62  90  58
1  56   1  79  13  38  19  15  97  31
2  80  44  55  86  67  27  69  56  60
3  74   8  81  51  72  50  83  80  50
4  69  10  15  65   6  39  95  81  13
5  96  52  99  69  14  52   1  25  79
6  83  87  91  34  91  58   9  62  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a share of the items that maximizes their respective valuations while distributing all 9 items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation for an item that hasn't been assigned yet.
2. Repeat the allocation until all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 7 with a valuation of 90.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 7, but it is already allocated. The next highest available is item 2 with a valuation of 79.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3 with a valuation of 86.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 6 with a valuation of 83.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 6, but it is already allocated. The next highest available is item 7 with a valuation of 81, but it is already allocated. The next highest available is item 2 with a valuation of 15, but it is already allocated. The next highest available is item 3 with a valuation of 65, but it is already allocated. The next highest available is item 0 with a valuation of 69.
6. Agent 5 highly values item 2 with a valuation of 99, but it is already allocated. The next highest available is item 0 with a valuation of 96, but it is already allocated. The next highest available is item 8 with a valuation of 79.
7. Agent 6 highly values item 4 with a valuation of 91.

Now, ensure all items are allocated:

- Item 1 is unallocated; assign it to Agent 0, who values it at 48.
- Item 5 is unallocated; assign it to Agent 3, who values it at 50.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [4]
}
```
