Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  90  41  72  75  96  64  12  94
1  23  84  47  83  88  54  92  34  61
2  14  19  77   4  38  90  68  85  12
3  99  98   3  65  96  15  59  92  33
4  78  80  19  60  91  15  48  32  86
5  94  60  11  59  59  72  44  89  80
6   7  35  91  71   7  16   1  84  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider various approaches, such as maximizing the total valuation, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, or trying to balance the total valuation received by each agent. Given the constraint of keeping each agent's allocation as an integer and ensuring all items are allocated, let's attempt a balanced approach that considers the agents' preferences and spreads the items fairly:

1. Start by identifying the highest value item for each agent, if possible.
2. Distribute remaining items by considering the next highest valuations while trying to balance the total value for each agent.

Here's a potential allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item with a preference towards items they value highly.
