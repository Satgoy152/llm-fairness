Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  48  57  57  67  90   9   3  91
1   3  68  77  86  27  97  28  30  57
2  37  13  10  90  85  97  30  32  28
3  33  70  19  43  50  62  94  45  96
4  39  62  31  16  60  44  76  49  67
5   6  33  79  53  10  50  77  90  81
6   9  36  82  14  85  72  23  21  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on the values they have assigned to the items, while ensuring every item is allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 5 (90) and item 8 (91).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 3 (86).
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 4 (85) and item 2 (10).
4. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 6 (94).
5. Agent 4 has the highest value for item 1 (62).
6. Agent 5 has the highest value for item 7 (90).
7. Agent 6 receives item 0 as it is the remaining unallocated item with a relatively balanced distribution.

Based on these allocations, here is the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, and every agent receives at least one item.
