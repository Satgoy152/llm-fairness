Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  95  27  19  85  80  57  24  62
1  27  93  84  28  78  14  39  57  21
2  79  50  42  65  83  61  83   9  27
3  91  88  36  23  88  64  26  13  11
4  55  18  91  21  48  18  24  46  62
5   1  21  69   3  39  10   6  26  60
6  66  24  50  65  15  24  73  10  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to give each agent items they value the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

We'll start by identifying the highest-valued items for each agent and then gradually allocate items, ensuring fairness and that no agent is left without items. Here's one way to do it:

1. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, without leaving any agent without an item.
   
2. Adjust as necessary to ensure all agents have at least one item and exactly nine items are allocated.

Given the table, let's proceed with this method:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 and 1 highly.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 highly.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 highly.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 and 4 highly.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 highly.
6. Agent 5 values item 2 highly.
7. Agent 6 values item 6 highly.

After considering these values, we can make the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [4]
- Agent 2: Items [6]
- Agent 3: Items [3]
- Agent 4: Items [2]
- Agent 5: Items [8]
- Agent 6: Items [1, 7]

This ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [1, 7]
}
```
