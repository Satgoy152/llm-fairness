Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  70  89  12  52  69  72  45  57
1  91   6  71  70  25  18  29   3  28
2  13  85   1  30   5  73  42  63  39
3   0  35  43  52  34  30  70  50  59
4  99  37  49  79  87   6  79  75  63
5  69  51   8  74  18  93   3   1  80
6  72  91  40  82  95  69  45  69  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed. We can distribute the items by considering the valuations and attempting to maximize fairness, which could mean each agent receives items that they value highly. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has relatively high valuations for items 1 and 2. Allocating these items to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 0, so we allocate it to them.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has a high valuation for item 5. Allocating item 5 to Agent 2 increases their satisfaction.

4. **Agent 3**: Item 6 is highly valued by Agent 3, making it a good allocation choice.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values items 4 and 8 highly, so we allocate these items to them.

6. **Agent 5**: Item 3 has a high valuation for Agent 5, so we allocate it here.

7. **Agent 6**: Finally, item 7 is highly valued by Agent 6, making it a suitable allocation.

Here's how the allocation looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 8],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they highly value and all items are distributed among the agents.
