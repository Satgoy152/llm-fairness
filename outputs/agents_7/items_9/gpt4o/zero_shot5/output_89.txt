Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  30   5  25  59  82  63  97  10
1  97  60  37  83  71  26  82   3  16
2  10   8  75  31  16  40  46  39  97
3  27  78  96  92  27  99  47  52  60
4  97  88   7  44  43   1  74  36  56
5  95  14  33  98  25  50   2  51  43
6  80  10  11  54  47  57  63  35  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. We need to distribute exactly 9 items among the 7 agents, which means some agents will receive more than one item. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 highly.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 highly.
3. Agent 2 values item 8 highly.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 highly.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 highly.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 highly.
7. Agent 6 values item 4 highly.

For the remaining two items:

- Item 6 can go to Agent 0, who has a high valuation for it.
- Item 2 can go to Agent 3, who values it highly.

This distribution aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction for their allocated items. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5, 2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed.
