Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18   6  93  54  67  31  58  45  92
1  80  12  32  99   7  55  20  98  91
2  59  77  74  85  23  60  30  73  15
3  15  71  75  23  15   2  29  33  15
4  63  92  25  97  58  92   9  89  88
5  12  60  28  20  41  93  78  74  30
6   2  70  55  95  60   1  27  33  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, I'll aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives roughly equal value if possible, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 0, who values it the highest.
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1, who values it the highest.
3. Assign item 1 to agent 2, who values it second highest.
4. Assign item 7 to agent 3, who values it the highest.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 4, who values it the highest.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 5, who values it the highest.
7. Assign item 8 to agent 6, who values it the highest.
8. Assign item 0 to agent 1, who values it the second highest.
9. Assign item 6 to agent 5, who values it the highest.

Each agent's allocation is balanced based on their highest valuations to ensure fairness. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 6],
    "6": [8]
}
```
