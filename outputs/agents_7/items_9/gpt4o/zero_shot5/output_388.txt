Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  51  77  53  65  55  97  77  59
1  22  53  13  69  64  19  78  67  88
2  84  52  74  59  76   8  11  48  85
3  95  14   9  81  16  69  89  99  11
4  43  88  44  13  10  66  65  18  60
5  81  62  83  60  96  23  64  24  81
6  11  77  94  49  96  23  21  68  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of the agents and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 9 items allocated.

One way to approach this is to allocate items based on maximizing the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and no more than two items per agent since there are 7 agents and 9 items in total, which allows us to spread out the allocations fairly.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate one of the top valued items to each agent.
3. Allocate the remaining items to agents based on their next highest valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated.

After going through this logical process, here is one fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item (except one agent receives two), and all items are allocated based on maximizing the agent's valuations.
