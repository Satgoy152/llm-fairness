Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  12  23  68  22  10  27  38  60
1   6  88  52  28  28  90  79  29  43
2  64  73  14  95  56  79  55   9  78
3  25  88  55  85  60  33  15  68  25
4  53  13  88  86  23  54  73  53  92
5  91   9   7  57  75  36  71  62  35
6  72  85  97  25   9  36  23  23  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most with a value of 68.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most with a value of 90.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most with a value of 95, but it's already assigned to Agent 0, so we assign the next highest, item 1 with 73.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most with a value of 88, but it's already assigned to Agent 2, so we assign the next highest, item 3 with 85.
- Agent 4 values item 8 the most with a value of 92.
- Agent 5 values item 0 the most with a value of 91.
- Agent 6 values item 2 the most with a value of 97.

Next, we need to fill in the remaining items:

- Items 4, 6, and 7 are left to allocate.
- Agent 1 can take item 4 with a value of 28, since item 5 was already assigned.
- Agent 6 can take item 6 with a value of 23, since item 2 was already assigned.
- Agent 5 can take item 7 with a value of 62, since item 0 was already assigned.

Now, all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [0, 7],
    "6": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while maximizing each agent's total valuation based on their highest preferences.
