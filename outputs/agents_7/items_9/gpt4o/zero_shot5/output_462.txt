Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  21  93  10   9  30  33  16  76
1  32  36  14  49  55  57  68  92  10
2  74   3  78  81  20   1  91  94  93
3  86  47  33  10  10   7  14  80  53
4  55  46  74  51  52  98  66  77  34
5  36  85  54  56  64  56  10  21  48
6  54  36  66  97   3  76  11  16  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. This can be done using a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here is the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 86, the highest among all agents.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 5 values it at 85, the highest among all agents.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 93, the highest among all agents.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 6 values it at 97, the highest among all agents.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it at 55, the highest among all agents.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 4 values it at 98, the highest among all agents.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 2 values it at 91, the highest among all agents.
8. **Item 7:** Agent 2 values it at 94, the highest among all agents.
9. **Item 8:** Agent 2 values it at 93, the highest among all agents.

After allocating based on these highest valuations, here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 7, 8],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [3]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated items based on the highest valuation for those items, ensuring a fair distribution according to their preferences.
