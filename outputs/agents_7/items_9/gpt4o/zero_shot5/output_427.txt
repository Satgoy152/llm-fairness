Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  18  62  89  76  61  60  38  80
1  57  24  41  26   7  92  62  50  88
2  88  52  39  77  68  60  22  77  78
3  80  78  59  13  94  69  12  92  80
4  55  15  74  33  66  76  94  37  13
5  15  64  60  16  43  86  73  28  75
6   7  94  79  53   8  64  19  78  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Assign each agent one item based on their highest valuation that hasn't been assigned yet.
2. Allocate any remaining items based on the next highest valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 with 89.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5 with 92.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 with 88.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4 with 94.
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 6 with 94.
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 5, but it's already taken, so the next highest is item 8 with 75.
7. Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 1 with 94.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 2 is unallocated. The highest remaining bid is from Agent 6 for 79.
- Item 7 is unallocated. The highest remaining bid is from Agent 3 for 92.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each item going to the agent who values it the most, after considering previous allocations.
