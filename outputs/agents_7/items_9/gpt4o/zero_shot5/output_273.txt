Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  15   1  18  43  16  81  99  13
1  36   9  24  95  92  32  12  89   1
2  35   8  83  89  98   6  88  13  29
3  17  98  27  34  40  39  71  53  96
4   6  60  50  54  12  96  37  91  79
5  74  75  24  25   2  45  41  42  63
6  78  18   8  10  20  21  49  84  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is done in a way that considers the valuations provided. Since there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 7, as it has the highest value for them (99).
- Agent 1: Allocate item 3, as it has the highest value for them (95).
- Agent 2: Allocate item 4, as it has the highest value for them (98).
- Agent 3: Allocate item 1, as it has the highest value for them (98).
- Agent 4: Allocate item 5, as it has the highest value for them (96).
- Agent 5: Allocate item 0, as it has the highest value for them (74).
- Agent 6: Allocate item 6, as it has the highest value for them (49).

Now, items 2 and 8 remain unallocated. We can assign these remaining items based on second highest valuations or to balance the number of items.

- Agent 2: Allocate item 2, as they have a high valuation for it (83).
- Agent 3: Allocate item 8, as they have a high valuation for it (96).

This way, every agent gets at least one item, and we have allocated all 9 items. Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [1, 8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6]
}
```
