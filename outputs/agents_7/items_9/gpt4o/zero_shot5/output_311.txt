Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80   0  33  58  14   6  87  59  48
1  38   3  93  14  11  26  87  32  66
2  99   3  28  76  29  46  94  80  39
3  66   1  45  17  87  24  71   6  67
4  37  54  87  50  29  74  40  88  63
5  74  26  45   4  98  63  65  73  37
6  26  24  42  43  85  94  18  77  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. Given that there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify the Highest Value for Each Item:** For each item, determine which agent values it the most. This can be done by looking at the highest valuation in each column of the table.

2. **Allocate Items to Agents:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Ensure Each Agent Gets at Least One Item:** If an agent is left without any items, reassign one item from another agent (preferably the one with the smallest reduction in value).

4. **Adjust for Fairness:** Balance the allocations by ensuring no agent has too many more items than others.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 99.
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it at 54.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 93.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 76.
- Item 4: Agent 5 values it at 98.
- Item 5: Agent 6 values it at 94.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 94.
- Item 7: Agent 4 values it at 88.
- Item 8: Agent 3 values it at 67.

Initially, this allocation gives Agent 2 three items, Agent 4 two items, and Agents 1, 3, 5, and 6 one item each. Agent 0 is left with no items, so we need to adjust:

1. Reassign item 3 (second-highest valuation is Agent 0 with 58) from Agent 2 to Agent 0.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 6
- Agent 3: Item 8
- Agent 4: Items 1, 7
- Agent 5: Item 4
- Agent 6: Item 5

This allocation ensures every agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 9.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1, 7],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [5]
}
```
