Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  23  93  45  87  40  17  17  22
1  16  87  97  14  78  97  59  73  42
2  62  63  57  82  56  15  50  74  56
3   7   7  67  15  80   4  20  29  38
4  23  29  89  49  19  40   2  66  29
5  30  25  60  98  70  64  33  96  95
6  61  46  35  78  85  91  91  13  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method that considers both the total valuation each agent has for the items and the need for fair distribution. One approach is to allocate items sequentially to the agent who values them the most while ensuring that all agents get a fair share of the total value.

Here is the allocation plan considering the highest valuations for each agent and trying to distribute items fairly:

1. Assign one item to each of the seven agents to ensure that all have at least one item.
2. Allocate the remaining two items based on maximizing the value for agents who have relatively lower total valuations.

After evaluating the valuations, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item [0]: Valuation is 99
- Agent 1 gets items [2, 5]: Valuations are 97, 97
- Agent 2 gets item [3]: Valuation is 82
- Agent 3 gets items [4, 8]: Valuations are 80, 38
- Agent 4 gets item [1]: Valuation is 29
- Agent 5 gets item [7]: Valuation is 96
- Agent 6 gets item [6]: Valuation is 91

Thus, the allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and the total value for each agent is maximized based on their preferences.
