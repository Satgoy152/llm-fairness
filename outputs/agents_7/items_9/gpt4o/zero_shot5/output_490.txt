Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  40  79  51  91  71  58  50  96
1  84  88  23  73  50  50  65  97  45
2  78  52  37  80  83  85  54  84   4
3  26  60  20   4   0  39  25  11  96
4  37  28  43  20  65  20  95  43  19
5  87  50  47  48  71  33  29   1  42
6  50  91  70  29  25  55  51  70  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that considers the valuations of each agent, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent a high-value item based on their preferences.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated by considering the remaining unallocated items and distributing them to agents such that their total valuation is maximized.

Let's proceed with this allocation approach:

- Agent 0 values item 8 the highest (96).
- Agent 1 values item 7 the highest (97).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (85).
- Agent 3 values item 8 the highest (96), but since item 8 is already taken, we consider item 1 (60).
- Agent 4 values item 6 the highest (95).
- Agent 5 values item 0 the highest (87).
- Agent 6 values item 1 the highest (91), but since item 1 is already taken, we consider item 2 (70).

Now, let's finalize the allocations ensuring all items are assigned:

- Agent 0: [8]
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [6]
- Agent 5: [0]
- Agent 6: [2, 3, 4]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent's preferences are considered.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
