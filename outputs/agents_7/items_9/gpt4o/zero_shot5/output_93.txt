Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  74   9  39  77  78  36  13  27
1  37  56  26  63  73  77  22  61  77
2  56  96  13  30  74  47  52  58  31
3  59  80  77  88  32  16  77  85  69
4  80  71  38  26  97  74  14  43  95
5  13  73  37  90   8  18  27  94   4
6  24  17  18  59   6  58  30  84  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to ensure that all 9 items are distributed across the 7 agents. One approach to achieve this is to try to maximize the total valuation for each agent, but since there are more agents than items, not every agent will receive an item.

Here's a possible allocation based on the valuations given:

- Agent 0: 1 item
- Agent 1: 2 items
- Agent 2: 1 item
- Agent 3: 2 items
- Agent 4: 1 item
- Agent 5: 1 item
- Agent 6: 1 item

Now let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Item 4 (value 77)
- Agent 1: Items 5 and 8 (values 77 and 77)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (value 96)
- Agent 3: Items 3 and 6 (values 88 and 77)
- Agent 4: Item 0 (value 80)
- Agent 5: Item 7 (value 94)
- Agent 6: Item 2 (value 18)

Now presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are distributed.
