Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  21  72  16  61  35  16   7  49
1  16  31  98  60  81  86  39  96  82
2  67  20  97  53  42  78  95   0   0
3  80  32  26  71  98  99  38  24  12
4  33  42  66  77  41  69  73  85  25
5  84  76  49  21  53  46  22  80  15
6  19  32  91  60  66  28  20  38  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuations for the items and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items. Let's attempt to allocate these items based on the highest valuations each agent has for different items, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 0.
2. Agent 1 receives items 2 and 7.
3. Agent 2 receives item 6.
4. Agent 3 receives items 4 and 5.
5. Agent 4 receives item 3.
6. Agent 5 receives item 1.
7. Agent 6 receives item 8.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item (where possible), and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [8]
}
```
