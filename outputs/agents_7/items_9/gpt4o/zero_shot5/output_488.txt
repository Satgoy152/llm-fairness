Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79   3  66  14  73  70  52  58  10
1  96  73  88  23  92  23  81  75  40
2  55   5  55  86  51  66  97  63  36
3  69  14  25  16  27  83  43  79  56
4  70  91  48   1  63  96  14  76  33
5  64  42  46  44  62  30  79  77  22
6  77  96  73  26  30  89  95  15  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that ensures a balanced and optimal distribution based on the given valuations. One possible approach is to assign each agent the item they value the most, and then adjust to ensure that each agent gets at least one item. Since there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

Let's proceed with this allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the highest with 79.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the highest with 96, but since item 0 is taken, assign them item 4 (92).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 the highest with 97.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the highest with 83.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 5 the highest with 96, but since item 5 is taken, assign them item 1 (91).
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 6 the highest with 79, but since item 6 is taken, assign them item 7 (77).
7. **Agent 6**: Values item 1 the highest with 96, but since item 1 is taken, assign them item 2 (73).

Now we need to ensure all items are allocated. The remaining items are 3, 8.

- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, who has already received item 6, but values item 3 the second highest.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 0, who already has item 0, but values item 8 next.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [2]
}
```
