Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  55  28  45  35  96  28  91  24
1  73  14  32   4   6  65  68  23  83
2  13   7  65  30  31  60  14  88   3
3   8  54  62  50  27  29  14  63  69
4  84  21   6  53  45   6  66  95  96
5  55  72  37  57  52   5  53  34  57
6  24  65  65  23  60  43  86  49  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we can aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and no items are left unallocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. First, we identify the items that are most highly valued by each agent.
2. Then, we try to allocate these items to the respective agents, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
3. Finally, we allocate the remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Based on the given valuations, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 8 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 8 the most, but since it's already allocated to agent 1, the next highest is item 3.
- Agent 4 values item 8 the most, but since it's already allocated, the next highest is item 7.
- Agent 5 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 6 values item 6 the most.

Let's distribute the items:

- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 4 (next highest available for Agent 4).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 5.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 6.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest available).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 4 (next highest available).

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [6]
}
```
