Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  30   5  81  71  37  29   0  24
1  24  14   1  56  65  57  31  37  25
2  97  24  52  38  66  85  70   6   8
3  31  76  21  80   3  45  15  85  95
4  61  22  52  85  66  36  46  90  60
5  50  22  43  96  43  66  13  78  70
6  97  97   1  87  79  53  37  15  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. The aim is to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation should be as fair as possible based on their preferences.

Here is one way to approach this allocation:

1. Identify the highest valued item for each agent and try to assign it if it's not already taken.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item by allocating the next highest available item if their top choice is taken.
3. Continue the allocation process while ensuring no more than 9 items are distributed.

Following this approach, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (81). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (65). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (97). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 8 the most (95). Assign item 8 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 7 the most (90). Assign item 7 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most (96), but it's already assigned. The next highest is item 5 (66). Assign item 5 to Agent 5.
- Agent 6 values item 0 and 1 equally (97), but item 0 is taken. Assign item 1 to Agent 6.

Now, we have assigned 7 items, so we need to allocate 2 more items to complete the allocation of 9 items.

- The remaining items are 2 and 6. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (next highest for Agent 1) and item 6 to Agent 0 (next highest for Agent 0).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all agents get at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed.
