Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  20   0  30  44  29  10  27  37
1  68  62  26  85  55  49  32  18  48
2  13   7  33  55  78  78  30  43  10
3  69  19  44  83  65  94  32  83  55
4  23  59  47  74  58   2  35  60  73
5  88   2  64  42  18  70  49  35  20
6  77  78  49  92  80  61  14  83  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [77 78 49 92 80 61 14 83 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate all the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 9 items allocated. Here's one way to achieve a fair distribution:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 77.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 85.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 and 5 equally at 78.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest at 94.
5. Agent 4 values item 8 the highest at 73.
6. Agent 5 values item 0 the highest at 88.
7. Agent 6 values item 1 the highest at 78.

By considering the highest valuations and ensuring each agent gets at least one item, we can form a fair allocation.

Here is one possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [1, 6, 7]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 0 is given item 2.
- Agent 1 is given item 3.
- Agent 2 is given item 4.
- Agent 3 is given item 5.
- Agent 4 is given item 8.
- Agent 5 is given item 0.
- Agent 6 is given items 1, 6, and 7.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and a total of 9 items are allocated.
