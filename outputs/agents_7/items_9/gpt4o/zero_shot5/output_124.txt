Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  80  29  96   1  82  77  12  20
1  95  43  64  30  61  99  60  53  25
2  56   7  83   0  18  10  63  12  58
3  29  33  51  44  28  47   5  62  46
4  35  20   1  58  79  72   0  60  32
5  19  82  55  37  40  84  78  71  26
6  58  46  26  84  90  30  94  21  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. This can be challenging, especially when the number of items is fewer than the number of agents, as is the case here. One approach is to allocate items by maximizing each agent's individual utility, while also considering fairness.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring every agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Adjust assignments if necessary to ensure fairness and that all items are allocated.

Let's apply this approach to the given table:

- Item 0 is most valued by Agent 1 (95).
- Item 1 is most valued by Agent 0 (80).
- Item 2 is most valued by Agent 2 (83).
- Item 3 is most valued by Agent 0 (96).
- Item 4 is most valued by Agent 6 (90).
- Item 5 is most valued by Agent 1 (99).
- Item 6 is most valued by Agent 6 (94).
- Item 7 is most valued by Agent 5 (71).
- Item 8 is most valued by Agent 2 (58).

Assigning the items based on these valuations, and ensuring that each agent gets a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 8]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [7]
- Agent 6: [4, 6]

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents based on their valuations, while also attempting to maintain a fair distribution of total value.
