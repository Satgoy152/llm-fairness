Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  22  26  38  71  29  43  41  22
1  32  25  40  61  83  36  87  21  85
2   8  14  79  85  32  45  84  36  38
3  43  67   5  96  41  41  17  95  62
4  72  19  84  80  93  17  98  63  77
5  85  92  33  17  67  43   3  48  28
6  66  80  49  53   6  62  70  26  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated without duplication. We can approach this by considering the valuations and ensuring a balanced distribution as much as possible.

Let's allocate the items based on the agents' highest valuations to ensure that each agent receives items they value significantly. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0: Receives items that they value relatively highly.
2. Agent 1: Similarly, gets items they highly value.
3. Repeat this process for each agent.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2 (High valuations: 53, 26)
- Agent 1: Items 4, 8 (High valuations: 83, 85)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (High valuation: 85)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (High valuation: 95)
- Agent 4: Item 6 (High valuation: 98)
- Agent 5: Item 1 (High valuation: 92)
- Agent 6: Item 5 (High valuation: 62)

By following this strategy, each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that no agent is left without any items and that the items are distributed according to their valuations where possible.
