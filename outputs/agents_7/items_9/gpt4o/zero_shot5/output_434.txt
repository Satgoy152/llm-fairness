Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  49  49  92  14   7   8  51  22
1  93  80  46  74  93  22  48  73  69
2  51   7  32  29  71  24  59   3  21
3  26  19  40  38  10  14  19  40  84
4  70  83  69  92  91  14  51  52  66
5   8  19   6   0  68  93  74  56  59
6  79  17  75  19   7  75  37  78   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the allocation maximizes the total valuation. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign the items to the agents based on their highest valuation for each item. 
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, adjusting if necessary to maintain fairness.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0 has the highest valuation (93) by Agent 1.
- Item 1 has the highest valuation (83) by Agent 4.
- Item 2 has the highest valuation (75) by Agent 6.
- Item 3 has the highest valuation (92) by Agent 0 or Agent 4.
  - Assign to Agent 0 to ensure each agent gets at least one item.
- Item 4 has the highest valuation (93) by Agent 1.
- Item 5 has the highest valuation (93) by Agent 5.
- Item 6 has the highest valuation (74) by Agent 5.
- Item 7 has the highest valuation (78) by Agent 6.
- Item 8 has the highest valuation (84) by Agent 3.

Now, distribute the items to ensure each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 8
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Item 5, 6
- Agent 6: Item 7

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5, 6],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated.
