Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  36   8   3  29  16  92  20  11
1  43   4  79  31  76  73  95  65  21
2  99  57  10  68  85  77  26  72  11
3  68  12   2  80  97  69  71  20  36
4  86  40  95  29  94  40  99  28  55
5  37  84  90  95  80  58  68  91  86
6  29  76  15  32  41  82   1  35  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets an approximately equal share of value based on their preferences. Let's analyze the table and allocate the items.

We have 7 agents and 9 items. Each agent should ideally get at least one item, but since we only have 9 items, some agents may not get any items.

Let's start by allocating one item to each agent based on their highest valuation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (98).
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (95).
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (85).
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (97). However, since item 4 is already allocated, we choose their next highest valued item, which is item 3 (80).
5. Agent 4 values item 6 the highest (99). However, since item 6 is already allocated, we choose their next highest valued item, which is item 2 (95).
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the highest (95). However, since item 3 is already allocated, we choose their next highest valued item, which is item 1 (84).
7. Agent 6 values item 5 the highest (82).

Now, we have allocated 7 items: 0 to Agent 0, 6 to Agent 1, 4 to Agent 2, 3 to Agent 3, 2 to Agent 4, 1 to Agent 5, and 5 to Agent 6.

We have 2 items left to allocate (items 7 and 8). Let's allocate them based on the next highest available valuations:

1. Agent 0's next highest unallocated item is item 6 (already taken), then item 0 (already taken), then item 7 (20).
2. Agent 1's next highest unallocated item is item 7 (65).
3. Agent 2's next highest unallocated item is item 5 (77), but it's already taken, then item 7 (72).
4. Agent 3's next highest unallocated item is item 5 (69), already taken, then item 7 (20).
5. Agent 4's next highest unallocated item is item 1 (40), but it's already taken, then item 3 (29), already taken, then item 8 (55).
6. Agent 5's next highest unallocated item is item 4 (80), but it's already taken, then item 8 (86).
7. Agent 6's next highest unallocated item is item 8 (18).

Based on the above, items 7 and 8 are allocated to the agents with the highest remaining valuations and not repeating allocations:

- Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (65 is the highest remaining valuation for item 7).
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 5 (86 is the highest remaining valuation for item 8).

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 8],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, with consideration of the highest possible individual valuations and fairness in distribution.
