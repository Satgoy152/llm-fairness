Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  95  83  21  23  60  33  74  47
1  30  80   2  33  89  72  16  18  88
2  69  24  57  51  21  18  38  32  55
3  38  27  47  38  31  74  68  57  52
4  38  82  14  84  19  69  36  16  96
5  30  61  67  44  86  32  71  76  48
6  49  82  49  31  55  15   3  60   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction for each agent while ensuring that all items are assigned. One straightforward approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 0. (Agent 0 values it at 95)
2. Assign item 4 to agent 1. (Agent 1 values it at 89)
3. Assign item 0 to agent 2. (Agent 2 values it at 69)
4. Assign item 5 to agent 3. (Agent 3 values it at 74)
5. Assign item 8 to agent 4. (Agent 4 values it at 96)
6. Assign item 6 to agent 5. (Agent 5 values it at 71)
7. Assign item 7 to agent 6. (Agent 6 values it at 60)
8. Assign item 2 to agent 0. (Agent 0 values it at 83)
9. Assign item 3 to agent 4. (Agent 4 values it at 84)

This way, we ensure that each item is given to the agent who values it highly, while also ensuring that all agents are considered in the allocation process.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [8, 3],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [7]
}
```
