Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  24  68   3   4  35  39  66  94
1  41  22  68  65  60  82  25  43  21
2  71  56  68  41  65  11  22  87  46
3  71  35  46  24   0  55  41  39  27
4  31  93   6  52   9  26  19  36  60
5  73  56  49   8  98  78  15  85  72
6  63  29  58  39  14  89  49  99  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation while considering the overall fairness of the distribution. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with this approach:

**Step 1: Calculate total valuations for each agent:**

- Agent 0: 93 + 24 + 68 + 3 + 4 + 35 + 39 + 66 + 94 = 426
- Agent 1: 41 + 22 + 68 + 65 + 60 + 82 + 25 + 43 + 21 = 427
- Agent 2: 71 + 56 + 68 + 41 + 65 + 11 + 22 + 87 + 46 = 467
- Agent 3: 71 + 35 + 46 + 24 + 0 + 55 + 41 + 39 + 27 = 338
- Agent 4: 31 + 93 + 6 + 52 + 9 + 26 + 19 + 36 + 60 = 332
- Agent 5: 73 + 56 + 49 + 8 + 98 + 78 + 15 + 85 + 72 = 534
- Agent 6: 63 + 29 + 58 + 39 + 14 + 89 + 49 + 99 + 11 = 451

**Step 2: Allocate items based on highest valuations:**

- Item 0: Agent 0 (93)
- Item 1: Agent 4 (93)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (68)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (65)
- Item 4: Agent 5 (98)
- Item 5: Agent 6 (89)
- Item 6: Agent 3 (41)
- Item 7: Agent 6 (99)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (94)

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. It attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by allocating items to agents who value them the most.
