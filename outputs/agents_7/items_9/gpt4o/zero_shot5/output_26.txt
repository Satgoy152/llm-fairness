Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35   2  95  92   0  61   2  20  67
1  92  17  29  29  64   9  54  96  71
2  20  59  50  33   5  77  41  41  89
3  33  25  93  12  79  74  67  27   3
4  21  88   9  35   1   0  70  19  78
5  75  17  33  18  84   0  44  67  67
6  35  31  91  69   0  21  86  11  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and the distribution is fair based on their valuations. We will use a method that ensures each agent gets at least one item and tries to maximize the overall valuation:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most, provided that the item is still available.
2. Once each agent has at least one item, assign the remaining items to the agents who value them the most.

Let's implement this:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most with a valuation of 95.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most with a valuation of 92.
3. Agent 2 values item 8 the most with a valuation of 89.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the most with a valuation of 93, but since item 2 is already taken, we assign item 5 with a valuation of 74.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the most with a valuation of 88.
6. Agent 5 values item 4 the most with a valuation of 84.
7. Agent 6 values item 6 the most with a valuation of 86.

Now, we check the remaining items and allocate them based on the highest valuation by any agent who has not yet received.

Let's allocate:

- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 92, which is the highest among the remaining.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 96, which is the highest among the remaining.

The allocation is now complete. Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This ensures all items are allocated fairly among the agents, considering their highest valuations for the items.
