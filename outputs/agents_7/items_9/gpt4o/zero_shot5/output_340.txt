Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69  16  65  33   0  76  66  65  51
1  12  89  15  12  44   4  84  62  26
2  22  52  11  42  13  97  63  52  16
3  12  70  74   1  62  50   6  32  60
4  12  93  24  28  65  77  86  75  42
5   1   6  29  46  90  50  38  47  31
6  59  47  22  18  55  36  36  50  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall fairness and satisfaction. Given there are 9 items and 7 agents, it's likely that some agents will receive more items than others due to the integer constraint. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign items to agents based on the highest valuations to ensure that each agent gets items that they value the most.
2. Check if all items are allocated and make adjustments if necessary to ensure the total allocation is exactly 9 items.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 5] (High valuations for these items)
- Agent 1: Items [1, 6] (High valuations for these items)
- Agent 2: Items [7] (Fair allocation based on remaining high valuations)
- Agent 3: Items [2] (Fair allocation based on remaining high valuations)
- Agent 4: Items [4] (Fair allocation based on remaining high valuations)
- Agent 5: Items [3, 8] (Fair allocation based on remaining high valuations)
- Agent 6: No items, as the remaining items have been fairly distributed

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 8],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, respecting their valuations and trying to maximize fairness.
