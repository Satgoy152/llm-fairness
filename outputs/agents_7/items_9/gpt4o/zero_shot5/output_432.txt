Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  94  46  29   9  52  75  32   5
1  37  98  66  54  27  16  48   5  75
2  12  70  74  14  75  46  43  56  11
3  22   1  64  57   3  54  62  10  52
4  16  24  29  27  98  63  66  82  14
5  12   7  95  19  37  73  69  40  87
6  93  14  53  78  72  20  17  64  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that considers each agent's total valuation for all items and aims to maximize the total value for each agent. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent:** Sum up the values for each agent across all items.

2. **Allocate items to agents:** Start with the agent with the highest total valuation. Assign items one by one to each agent based on the highest value for that agent, ensuring that no item is assigned more than once.

3. **Continue this process:** Once an item is assigned, it cannot be assigned again. Continue until all items are allocated.

Let's implement this strategy:

**Total Valuations:**
- Agent 0: 385
- Agent 1: 426
- Agent 2: 401
- Agent 3: 327
- Agent 4: 419
- Agent 5: 439
- Agent 6: 493

**Allocations:**

1. **Agent 6** (Highest valuation: 493) gets the items with the highest values: 0 (93), 3 (78), 8 (82).

2. **Agent 5** (Next highest valuation: 439) gets the remaining highest values: 2 (95), 5 (73).

3. **Agent 1** gets the next highest values: 1 (98), 4 (27).

4. **Agent 2** gets item 6 (43).

5. **Agent 3** gets item 7 (10).

Let's format the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2, 5],
    "6": [0, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all 9 items are distributed.
