Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  11  74  53  91  10  22  94  86
1   6  93  77  19   9  40  93  95  45
2  23  95  47  99  49  89  26   8  59
3  46  73  56  28  55  98  66   4  99
4  93  61  11  72  22  91  19  58  79
5  51  41  32  18  94  69  54  59  47
6  16  81  20   2  86  54  21  87  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Given that there are 7 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more than one item while others will receive just one or none.

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 the most (91).
2. **Agent 1** values item 7 the most (95).
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most (99).
4. **Agent 3** values item 8 the most (99).
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 the most (93).
6. **Agent 5** values item 4 the most (94), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 5 (69).
7. **Agent 6** values item 8 the most (90), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 7 (87).

Now, let's resolve this based on individual maximum valuations while ensuring every item is allocated:

- **Agent 0**: [4] (91)
- **Agent 1**: [7] (95)
- **Agent 2**: [3] (99)
- **Agent 3**: [8] (99)
- **Agent 4**: [0] (93)
- **Agent 5**: [5] (69)
- **Agent 6**: [1, 2] (81, 20)

Each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1, 2]
}
```
