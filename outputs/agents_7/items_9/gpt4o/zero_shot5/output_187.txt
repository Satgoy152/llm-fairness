Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  90  64  26  39  84  80  13  10
1   6  41  30   5  11  26  23  91  93
2  15  27  57   9  55  60   8   7  48
3   4  11  66  72  92  56  46  38  37
4  43  69  70  51  44  15  85  11  26
5  96  92  38  50  19  63  84  13  86
6  24  88  47  18  95  32  99  63  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we need to consider an allocation that maximizes overall satisfaction based on the given valuations, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible. One approach is to look for a balanced distribution of items that maximizes total valuations for each agent.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 1 (valuation: 90) and item 5 (valuation: 84).
- Agent 1 gets item 8 (valuation: 93).
- Agent 2 gets item 4 (valuation: 55) and item 2 (valuation: 57).
- Agent 3 gets item 3 (valuation: 72).
- Agent 4 gets item 6 (valuation: 85).
- Agent 5 gets item 0 (valuation: 96).
- Agent 6 gets item 7 (valuation: 63).

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives an item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [7]
}
```
