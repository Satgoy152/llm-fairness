Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  88  68  16  64  11   3  86  45
1  65   0  52  60  62  56  98  74  87
2  88  27   1  93  14  56  44  77  65
3  83  98  81  65  37  30  67  15  18
4  84  65  31  97  98   9  19  40   3
5  92   6  79  35  87  60  83  77  92
6  98  16  84  34  84   1  81  19  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. We will ensure each agent receives at least one item, and we will distribute the items based on the highest valued items for each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once and each item is allocated to one agent only. 

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (94), 1 (88), and 7 (86). We'll allocate items 0 and 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 6 (98), 8 (87), and 7 (74). We'll allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (93), 0 (88), and 7 (77). We'll allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (98), 2 (81), and 0 (83). We'll allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (98), 3 (97), and 0 (84). We'll allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (92), 8 (92), and 6 (83). We'll allocate item 8 to Agent 5.

7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (98), 2 (84), and 4 (84). We'll allocate item 2 to Agent 6.

Now, let's compile the allocations into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
