Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38  64  79  44   2  85  87  24  70
1  20  34  54  49   6  90  64  72  80
2  72  19  55  87  71   2  96  34  91
3  19  25  84  99  75  93  82  65  33
4  42   4  44  50  74  30  85  59  26
5  23  21   4  82  39  19  14  61   1
6  82  36  21  47  86  52  33  85  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we can use the concept of maximizing total value for each agent while ensuring everyone gets a fair share. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Try to allocate items to agents in such a way that each agent gets items they value highly, while also ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 9.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Compute total valuation for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 493
   - Agent 1: 469
   - Agent 2: 527
   - Agent 3: 575
   - Agent 4: 414
   - Agent 5: 265
   - Agent 6: 512

2. Allocate items based on highest valuation for each item.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 6 (82)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (64)
- Item 2: Agent 3 (84)
- Item 3: Agent 3 (99)
- Item 4: Agent 6 (86)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (90)
- Item 6: Agent 2 (96)
- Item 7: Agent 6 (85)
- Item 8: Agent 1 (80)

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned and the total number of allocated items is 9.
