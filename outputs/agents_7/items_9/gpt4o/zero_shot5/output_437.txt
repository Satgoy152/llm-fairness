Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  48  70  38  50  12  29  26  83
1  93  27  17  10  16  14  46  74  58
2  58   6   2  19  18  69  41  99  80
3  94  68  75  70  17  13  10   9  40
4  90  31   5  40  64  41  77  89  86
5   5  78  38  55  21  46  71  28  71
6  46  86  51  44  44  76  83  74  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that we maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high value for item 2.
2. Agent 1 has high value for item 0.
3. Agent 2 has high value for item 7.
4. Agent 3 has high value for item 3.
5. Agent 4 has high value for item 8.
6. Agent 5 has high value for item 1.
7. Agent 6 has high value for item 6.
8. Assign the remaining items to balance the distribution as fairly as possible.

Given these considerations, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [6, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item. Each item is allocated, and the allocation is based on maximizing individual agent valuations.
