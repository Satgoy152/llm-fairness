Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  34  81  62  12  44  11  75  45
1  13  83  48  30  44   8  46  91  63
2  40  11  14  54  31  87  61  52  26
3  43  94  40  54  18  82  34  18   7
4  95  31  39  61  69  59  46  98   6
5  32  31  46  13  85  53  74  76   9
6  99  74  30  31  51  78  66  79  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible and all items are allocated. We can use a greedy approach to achieve this, where we iteratively assign items to agents based on their highest valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 6 to agent 5 (Value: 74).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 6 (Value: 99).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 3 (Value: 94).
4. Assign item 7 to agent 4 (Value: 98).
5. Assign item 8 to agent 1 (Value: 63).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (Value: 87).
7. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (Value: 62).
8. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (Value: 81).
9. Assign item 4 to agent 4 (Value: 69).

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while trying to distribute the items fairly among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7, 4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0]
}
```
