Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  79  35  91  16  75  56  30  20
1  32   6  80  89  39  70  69  93  43
2  29  24  72  37  30  28  50  72  77
3  76  25  49  20  95  99   7   1  15
4  31  48  43  80  33  50  97  36  26
5   8  68  81  64  38   5  13  22  84
6  19   3  71  83  12  91  13   4  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A simple approach is to assign items to the agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and no agent gets more than necessary.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 0 and 3. We allocate item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 7 and 3. We allocate item 7.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 8 and 2. We allocate item 8.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 5 and 4. We allocate item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 6 and 3. We allocate item 6.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuations are for items 8 and 2 (already allocated). We allocate item 2.
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (already allocated) and 3. We allocate item 3.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Items 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have been allocated to agents.
- Items 1 and 4 are still unallocated.

Let's allocate the remaining items:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 0, who values it at 79.
2. Assign item 4 to agent 3, who values it at 95.

Now, each item is allocated, and each agent has at least one item.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5, 4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [3]
}
```
