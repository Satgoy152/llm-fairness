Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  42  33  78  45  45  65  17  93
1  64  80  86  28  62  31   8  73  37
2  67  25  96  93  32  10  81  97  67
3  83   0  89  72  75  28  25   5  50
4  36  98   3  75  94  82  41  83  59
5   2  39  82  25  37  64  23  19  51
6  10   2  83  21  42  33  44  48  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. Since we have 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Let's prioritize maximizing the valuation for each agent while maintaining fairness.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent with one item based on their highest valuation.
2. Allocate the remaining items to the agents with the highest total valuations for their assigned items.

Let's proceed with this:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 8 (93).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (86).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (97).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (83).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (98).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (64).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (83), but already taken by agent 1. Next highest is item 0 (10), but already taken by agent 3. Next highest is item 6 (44).

After each agent has one item, we have two items left: items 3 and 4.

- Item 3: Highest valuation by agent 2 (93), but already taken. Next is agent 0 (78).
- Item 4: Highest valuation by agent 4 (94), but already taken. Next is agent 3 (75).

So, we allocate:

- **Item 3** to agent 0.
- **Item 4** to agent 3.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated at least one item, and all items have been assigned.
