Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  41  85  43  95  76  46  94  27
1  23  50  94  45  20  42  45  91  43
2  55  35  50  83  40  16   1  41  62
3  33  59  67  87  44  65  79  24  47
4  72  98  10  78  62  32  15  97  24
5  21  10  96  15  24  61  74  90   0
6  23   2  71  65  77  67   0  16  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, let's aim for maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item where possible. Since there are 9 items and 7 agents, two agents will receive an additional item. Here's one way to do it:

1. Assign each agent their highest valued item first.
2. Distribute the remaining items to the agents with the next highest value for those items, ensuring that no agent receives more than two items and every item is allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4 (value 95)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (value 94)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (value 83)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (value 79)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (value 98)
- Agent 5: Item 5 (value 61)
- Agent 6: Item 8 (value 80)

Now, we have one item left (item 0), and we can allocate it to the agent who values it highest among those who have only one item:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (value 91)

Now, Agent 0 has two items, and all items are allocated. Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [8]
}
```
