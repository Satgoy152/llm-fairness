Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  98  97  97  63  98  87  44  17
1  17   6  99   1  75  68  51   9  60
2  87  18  65  50  54  68   8  97  16
3   7  90  58  99  72  43  51  22   3
4  38  19  33  87  34  21  62  50  68
5  26  16  70  20  44  80  96  64  18
6  73  41  81  17  99  52  82   3  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can attempt to distribute them such that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item where possible. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. We first list each item's highest value and allocate it to the respective agent. If an item has the same highest value for multiple agents, we choose one that balances the number of items each agent receives.
2. We continue the allocation process until all items are distributed.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Highest value is 87 by agent 2.
- Item 1: Highest value is 98 by agent 0.
- Item 2: Highest value is 99 by agent 1.
- Item 3: Highest value is 99 by agent 3.
- Item 4: Highest value is 99 by agent 6.
- Item 5: Highest value is 98 by agent 0.
- Item 6: Highest value is 96 by agent 5.
- Item 7: Highest value is 97 by agent 2.
- Item 8: Highest value is 68 by agent 4.

Now here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed based on the highest values.
