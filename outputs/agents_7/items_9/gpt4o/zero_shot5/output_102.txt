Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  12  96  68  29  69  21  15  98
1  46  49  30  29  29  42  96  62  89
2  27  89  20  72  89  21  10  29  15
3  95  47  10  52  91  64  71  72  88
4  16  90  88  76  94  38  56  36  95
5  21   1  64  45  50   8   0  77  56
6  95  91  15  14  78  31  10   1  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, let's aim to distribute them in a way that considers the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuation for each item. We can iterate over each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most. Hereâ€™s the allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (95).
2. Item 1: Agent 6 has the highest valuation (91).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (96).
4. Item 3: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (72).
5. Item 4: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (94).
6. Item 5: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (69).
7. Item 6: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (96).
8. Item 7: Agent 5 has the highest valuation (77).
9. Item 8: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (98).

Now, let's organize these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, without exceeding the total number of items and maintaining integer allocations.
