Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  77  91  83  86  97  81  90  55
1  72  14  45  56  17  56  84  21  86
2  72  49  88   2  48  72  31  34  49
3  50  22  74  16  89  72  68  40  30
4  41  71  14  12   6  47  53  74  61
5  58  28  49  18  39  15  44  24  67
6  65  97  57  25  58  12  69  85  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, as there are 7 agents and 9 items.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0:** This agent has high values for several items. Let's give them item 5 (value 97) and item 2 (value 91).
2. **Agent 1:** This agent values item 8 highly (value 86). Let's allocate item 8 to this agent.
3. **Agent 2:** This agent values item 2 highly (value 88), but it's already allocated. We can give them item 0 (value 72).
4. **Agent 3:** This agent values item 4 highly (value 89). Let's allocate item 4 to them.
5. **Agent 4:** This agent has a relatively high valuation for item 7 (value 74). Let's give them item 7.
6. **Agent 5:** This agent has moderate values across the board. Let's give them item 8 (value 67), but since it's already allocated, we'll give item 6 (value 44).
7. **Agent 6:** This agent values item 1 highly (value 97). Let's allocate item 1 to them.

Now let's check the allocation and make adjustments if needed:

Allocated items: 
- Agent 0: [5, 2]
- Agent 1: [8]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [7]
- Agent 5: [6]
- Agent 6: [1]

All items [0-8] are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [1]
}
```
