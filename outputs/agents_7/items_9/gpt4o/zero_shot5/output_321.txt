Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  62  97   0  16  93  53  78  22
1  53  99   6  62  48  27  19  11  90
2  27  81  41  50  88  44  74  85  70
3   0  51  42  65  55  91   0   6  81
4  51  58  35  22  70  97  68  23  21
5  84   6  73  48   4  78  90  57  59
6  20  18  38  82  14  99  75  91  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 7 agents based on their valuations, I'll attempt to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes the total value they get, while also ensuring that each agent receives at least one item where possible, and all items are allocated. 

The goal is to balance fairness while trying to give each agent at least one of their higher-valued items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as it has the highest value for agent 0 (97).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as it has the highest value for agent 1 (99).
3. Assign item 8 to agent 2, as it has a high value for agent 2 (70) and is not the highest for any other agent.
4. Assign item 5 to agent 3, as it has the highest value for agent 3 (91).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 4, as it has a high value for agent 4 (70).
6. Assign item 0 to agent 5, as it has a high value for agent 5 (84).
7. Assign item 7 to agent 6, as it has a high value for agent 6 (91).
8. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as it is a remaining item with a decent value for agent 2 (50).
9. Assign item 6 to agent 5, as it has a high value for agent 5 (90).

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [8, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 6],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.
