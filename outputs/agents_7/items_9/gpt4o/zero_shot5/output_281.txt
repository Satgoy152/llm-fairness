Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  21  99  88  79  63  88  96  33
1  43  26  75  46  54  80  41   2  52
2  97  14  88  72  72  31   2  87  22
3  75  65  99   9  98  22  52  54  40
4  52   8  42  84  63  66  29  77  22
5  72  64  28  96  42  51  25  52  55
6  45  58  79  60   8  26  14  35  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. A common approach is to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation. Since there are 9 items and 7 agents, most agents will receive at least one item, and a few may receive more than one.

Here's a possible allocation based on maximizing the valuations of each agent:

1. Assign each agent their highest valued item.
2. Evaluate the remaining allocations to ensure all items are distributed.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 3 (assigned to Agent 4, pick next highest).
- Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 2 (assigned to Agent 0, pick next highest).

Re-evaluate to allocate remaining items:

- Item 1, 6, 7, and 8 are unallocated.

Reallocate based on remaining highest valuations:

- Agent 0: already has item 2, next highest is item 7.
- Agent 1: already has item 5, next highest is item 8.
- Agent 2: already has item 0, next highest is item 3.
- Agent 3: already has item 4, next highest is item 6.
- Agent 4: already has item 3, next highest is item 7 (already assigned, pick next).
- Agent 5: already has item 3 (assigned to Agent 4), next highest is item 1.
- Agent 6: already has item 2 (assigned to Agent 0), next highest is item 1 (assigned, pick next).

After considering the valuations and allocations, here is a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 7 agents, with some agents receiving more than one item based on their highest valuations.
