Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  31  39   0   9  17  43   1  65
1  79  97  65  63  68  42  32  12   4
2  61  82  53  66  29  26  51  84  82
3  74  22  63  36  76   5  56  83   4
4  60  16  90  88  85  74  84  91  48
5   2  31  24  83  93  72  68  22  30
6  78  78  84  34  87  63  24  86  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 31 39  0  9 17 43  1 65]
 [79 97 65 63 68 42 32 12  4]
 [61 82 53 66 29 26 51 84 82]
 [74 22 63 36 76  5 56 83  4]
 [60 16 90 88 85 74 84 91 48]
 [ 2 31 24 83 93 72 68 22 30]
 [78 78 84 34 87 63 24 86 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: They value Item 0 the most with a valuation of 95.
2. **Agent 1**: They have the highest valuation for Item 1 with a value of 97.
3. **Agent 2**: They value Item 7 the most with a valuation of 84.
4. **Agent 3**: They value Item 4 the most with a valuation of 76.
5. **Agent 4**: They value Item 2 the most with a valuation of 90.
6. **Agent 5**: They value Item 3 the most with a valuation of 83.
7. **Agent 6**: They value Item 8 the most with a valuation of 79.

Now, let's check if all items have been allocated. We have allocated 7 items so far. We need to allocate 2 more items.

8. **Agent 4**: They also have a high valuation for Item 5 with a value of 74.
9. **Agent 6**: They have a high valuation for Item 6 with a value of 24.

Now, all 9 items have been allocated. Here's the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 5],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [8, 6]
}
```
