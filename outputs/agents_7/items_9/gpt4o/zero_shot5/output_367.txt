Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  71  66  96  20  67  82  40  44
1  73  83  13  98  77  89  33  89  55
2  95  84  62  74  94  23  21  35  61
3  13  94  73  86  64  64  86   5  49
4  89  36  14  42  38  85  89  99  21
5  30  41  79  31  13  82   3  96  76
6  96  53  80  24  90  10  93  26  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each item is assigned. Here is one possible allocation:

Assign each item to the agent that values it the most.
Ensure that all items are allocated and each agent has a fair share.
Let's analyze the values and allocate accordingly:

Item 0: Agent 6 values it at 96.
Item 1: Agent 3 values it at 94.
Item 2: Agent 6 values it at 80.
Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 98.
Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 94.
Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 89.
Item 6: Agent 6 values it at 93.
Item 7: Agent 4 values it at 99.
Item 8: Agent 6 values it at 81.
The allocations based on these valuations are as follows:
```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0, 2, 6, 8]
}
```
