Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  26  35  66  20  99  96  65  41
1  95  91  73  43  62  46  80  28  54
2  25  74  38  35  75   8  84  11  87
3  37  73  93  77  45  26  27  27  86
4  61  97   9   7  87   4  87  93  42
5  91   9  10  33  74  88  15  95  45
6  36  57  70  61  62  36  25   6  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Given that there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while at least one agent will receive none.

Let's start by reviewing the valuations and proceed with the allocations.

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is for item 5 (value 99).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is for item 0 (value 95).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is for item 8 (value 87).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is for item 2 (value 93).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is for item 1 (value 97).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for Agent 5 is for item 7 (value 95).
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value for Agent 6 is for item 8, but it's already allocated to Agent 2, so the next highest is item 2 (value 70).

Given the priorities above and ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 5
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 0
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 8
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 2
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 1
- **Agent 5**: Allocate item 7
- **Agent 6**: No remaining unique high-value items, so allocate another remaining item, item 4.

Now, we have 7 items allocated. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items (items 3 and 6) to the agents with the least number of items allocated:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 5
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 0
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 8
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 2
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 1
- **Agent 5**: Already has item 7
- **Agent 6**: Already has item 4

Allocate items 3 and 6 to agents with lower total values:

- Allocate item 3 to **Agent 0** (next highest value for them).
- Allocate item 6 to **Agent 3** (next highest value for them).

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives their highest-valued available item, and the number of items allocated matches the number of items available.
