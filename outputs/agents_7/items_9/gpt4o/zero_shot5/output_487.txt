Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  19   7  58  71  99  66   6  53
1  99   4  36  90  54  76  35   3  63
2  23  46   5  27   6  61  19  47  72
3  80   8  12   9  95  16  91  16   4
4  21  94   6  99  21  12   8  44  84
5  51  56  90  67   7   2  43  74   8
6  58  56  14  55   0  85  32  29  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. We also need to allocate exactly 9 items in total, as per the problem statement. One approach is to prioritize giving items to agents based on their highest valuation and ensuring no agent is overloaded with items compared to others.

Let's go through the allocation process with the goal of maximizing the total valuation across all agents:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is item 5 (99).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is item 0 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is item 8 (72).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is item 4 (95).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is item 3 (99).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is item 2 (90).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is item 5 (85), but it's already taken by agent 0. Next highest is item 0 (58), but it’s taken by agent 1. Next is item 3 (55), but it’s taken by agent 4. Next highest available is item 1 (56).

Now let's assign the remaining items:

- Agent 0 has one item (5), and their next highest available valuation is item 4 (71), but it's taken by agent 3. Next is item 3 (58), but it's taken by agent 4. Next highest available is item 0 (73), but it’s taken by agent 1. Next highest available for agent 0 is item 7 (6).
- Agent 2 has one item (8), and next highest available is item 1 (46), but it's taken by agent 6. Next is item 3 (27), but it’s taken by agent 4. Next highest available is item 0 (23).
- Agent 3 has one item (4), and next highest is item 6 (91).
- Agent 4 has one item (3), and next highest is item 8 (84).
- Agent 5 has one item (2), and next highest is item 7 (74).
- Agent 6 has one item (1), and next highest available is item 6 (32), but it’s taken by agent 3. Next highest available is item 7 (29).

Now let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent gets an integer number of items, with a focus on maximizing their valuations.
