Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  34   6  50  42  80  66  87  77
1  22  80  33  42  97  56  59  32  94
2  51   5  75  26  74  52  78  68  28
3  42   1  56  48  41  50  41  38   6
4  66  18  53  45  55  75  10  94  78
5  29  36  66  38  11  13   7  16  81
6   4   6  32   1  62  16  35  66  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets an approximate fair share based on their valuations. Given that there are 9 items and 7 agents, each agent will not be able to receive exactly the same number of items, but we will try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 could be allocated item 7 (valuation of 87).
2. Agent 1 could be allocated item 4 and 8 (valuations of 97 and 94).
3. Agent 2 could be allocated items 2 and 6 (valuations of 75 and 78).
4. Agent 3 could be allocated item 3 (valuation of 48).
5. Agent 4 could be allocated item 5 (valuation of 75).
6. Agent 5 could be allocated item 1 (valuation of 36).
7. Agent 6 could be allocated item 0 (valuation of 4), which leaves them with a smaller value, but ensures all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [0]
}
```
