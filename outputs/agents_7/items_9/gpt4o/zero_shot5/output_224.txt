Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  71  62  57  50  97  44  13  12
1  98  10   8  68  74  42  98   2  86
2   2  11  92  59  76  17  89  27  84
3  58  88  29  97  70  95  85  69  42
4  82  92  42  89  51  26  31  12  19
5  64   5  26  29  73  10  74  47  47
6  77  16  26   2  76  13  47  16  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as equitable as possible based on the agents' valuations. Since there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive none. Our goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every item is allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent.
2. If possible, balance the number of items each agent receives to make the allocation as fair as possible.

Based on the valuations given, here is a possible fair allocation:

- Item 0 (max value 98 by agent 1)
- Item 1 (max value 92 by agent 4)
- Item 2 (max value 92 by agent 2)
- Item 3 (max value 97 by agent 3)
- Item 4 (max value 76 by agent 2)
- Item 5 (max value 97 by agent 0)
- Item 6 (max value 98 by agent 1)
- Item 7 (max value 69 by agent 3)
- Item 8 (max value 86 by agent 1)

Now, we distribute the items to the agents based on the highest valuation:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0, 6, 8]
- Agent 2: [2, 4]
- Agent 3: [3, 7]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: []
- Agent 6: []

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while also attempting to distribute the load fairly among the agents.

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 6, 8],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```
