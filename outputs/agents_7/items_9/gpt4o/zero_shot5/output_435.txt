Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  18   4  31  77  77  40  35  79
1  74  61  82  15   9  73  40  30   7
2  63  28  37  69  43  43  24  37  81
3  23  83  31  56  53  82  83  55  27
4  91  36  14   6  87  81  77  67  87
5  40   5  71  57  35  19  80  48  33
6  40  92  81  13  52  13  87  86  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that considers both maximizing the total valuation and attempting to distribute the items evenly among the agents. Since there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent.
2. Try to allocate items to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets close to the same number of items.
3. Since we have 9 items and 7 agents, 5 agents will get 1 item, and 2 agents will get 2 items each.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. Agent 0: Items (4, 8)
2. Agent 1: Item (2)
3. Agent 2: Item (3)
4. Agent 3: Item (5)
5. Agent 4: Item (0)
6. Agent 5: Item (6)
7. Agent 6: Item (1, 7)

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution tries to maximize individual agent valuations based on the given table.

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with some agents receiving more items based on their valuations.
