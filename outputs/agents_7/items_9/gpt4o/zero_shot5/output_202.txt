Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  30  40  97  53  56  80  42  24
1  55  56  12   2  50  48  89  77  76
2  39  33   0  77  71  20  80  67  23
3  47  67  64   5  93  53  48  38  13
4  54  15  19  80   8  82  65  41  96
5  98  40  74  93  24  15   0  23  50
6  30  77  88  75  76  58  24  96  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets a portion of the total items based on their preferences, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's consider the total valuation each agent has for all items to guide the allocation. This way, higher preference totals will be given priority.

First, calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 35 + 30 + 40 + 97 + 53 + 56 + 80 + 42 + 24 = 457
- Agent 1: 55 + 56 + 12 + 2 + 50 + 48 + 89 + 77 + 76 = 465
- Agent 2: 39 + 33 + 0 + 77 + 71 + 20 + 80 + 67 + 23 = 410
- Agent 3: 47 + 67 + 64 + 5 + 93 + 53 + 48 + 38 + 13 = 428
- Agent 4: 54 + 15 + 19 + 80 + 8 + 82 + 65 + 41 + 96 = 460
- Agent 5: 98 + 40 + 74 + 93 + 24 + 15 + 0 + 23 + 50 = 417
- Agent 6: 30 + 77 + 88 + 75 + 76 + 58 + 24 + 96 + 61 = 585

Now, based on these totals, we can start assigning the items one by one to the agent that values them the most, ensuring that we don't over-allocate items to any agent.

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 5 (value: 98).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 6 (value: 77).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 6 (value: 88).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value: 97).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (value: 93).
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 4 (value: 82).
7. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (value: 89).
8. Allocate item 7 to Agent 6 (value: 96).
9. Allocate item 8 to Agent 4 (value: 96).

Let's check the allocation to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [5, 8]
- Agent 5: [0]
- Agent 6: [1, 2, 7]

Now, I'll present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 8],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [1, 2, 7]
}
```
