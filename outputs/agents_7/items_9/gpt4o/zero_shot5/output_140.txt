Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  83  35  85  52  93  24  61  14
1  45  35  33   4   2  23  92  55  75
2  16  17  74  72  11  32  42   1  25
3   5  45  95  78  62  53  71  12  44
4   1  89  66  69  19  43  46  62  74
5   8  66  96  13  40  26  31  57  37
6  44  87  25  51  95  68  69  86  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items so that the valuations are maximized while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Given there are 7 agents and 9 items, some agents may receive more than one item while others may receive none.

Letâ€™s go through the process of allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Has the highest valuation for item 5 (93).
2. **Agent 1:** Has the highest valuation for item 6 (92).
3. **Agent 2:** Has the highest valuation for item 2 (74).
4. **Agent 3:** Has the highest valuation for item 2, but it is already taken by Agent 2. Next highest is item 3 (78).
5. **Agent 4:** Has the highest valuation for item 1 (89).
6. **Agent 5:** Has the highest valuation for item 2, but it is already taken. Next highest is item 5 (26).
7. **Agent 6:** Has the highest valuation for item 4 (95).

Now, check which items are still unallocated: items 0, 7, and 8.

Re-allocate remaining items based on the next highest preferences:

- **Agent 0:** Second highest is item 3 (already taken), then item 1, which is already taken. Next is item 0 (50).
- **Agent 6:** Second highest is item 1 (already taken), then item 7 (86).
- **Agent 4:** Second highest is item 8 (74).

Finally, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 8],
    "5": [],
    "6": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while maintaining fairness across the board.
