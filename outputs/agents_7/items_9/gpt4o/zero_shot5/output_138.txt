Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  35   4   6  69  30  68  31  83
1   0  50  58  83  77  83  76   6  24
2  54  94   1  50  33  95  73  54  27
3  63   3  89  50  27  51   0  94  56
4  85  73  31  50  63  59  32  71  14
5  22  25  20  75  83  75  83  25   8
6  74  44  37   7  68  79  71  37  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 7 agents, we can consider a strategy that aims to distribute items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are more agents than items, some agents will not receive any items. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each item across all agents.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations by agents for each item:

1. Item 0: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (96).
2. Item 1: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (94).
3. Item 2: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (89).
4. Item 3: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (83).
5. Item 4: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (77).
6. Item 5: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (95).
7. Item 6: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (76).
8. Item 7: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (94).
9. Item 8: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (83).

Now, we will assign the items to the agents based on these valuations while ensuring fairness:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 7]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: []
- Agent 6: []

This way, each agent who receives items is getting at least one of their highest-valued items, and all items are allocated. 

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent is included in the output.
