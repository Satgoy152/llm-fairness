Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  31  38  66  40  31  94  69  10
1  62  90  33  28  79  11  20  26  36
2  44  82  73  41  23  26  96  55  52
3  93  25  92  87  40  70  52  42  78
4   4  42  29  59  87  72   4   5  92
5  75  20  39  65   2  91  41  38   6
6  24  16  15  22  17  62  80  79  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Given the valuations provided, we'll aim to allocate items by considering the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Allocate the highest valued item for each agent.
2. Continue allocating the remaining items based on remaining valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 6 (value 94)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 1 (value 90)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 6 is already taken, next highest is Item 2 (value 73)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 0 (value 93)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 8 (value 92)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 5 (value 91)
7. **Agent 6**: Item 7 (value 79)

Now, we have allocated 7 items. We need to allocate 2 more items to the agents. The remaining items are 3 and 4.

Let's allocate them based on the next highest valuations:

8. **Agent 3**: Item 3 (value 87)
9. **Agent 0**: Item 4 (value 40)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [7]
}
```
