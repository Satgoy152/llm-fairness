Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  36  13  78  92  54  28  13  87
1  67  78  64  97  57  70  51   4  26
2   7   5  68  47  54  20  53  95  61
3  70  67  55  10  25  96   9  29  89
4  48  63  59   2  11   3  86  11  24
5  68   8  51  12   0  87  85  52  33
6  75  31  30  20  91  51  69  22  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach by considering each agent's valuation for the items and ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The aim is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while distributing all items.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 8.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 7 and 2.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 5 and 8.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 6 and 1.
- Agent 5 has high valuations for items 5 and 6.
- Agent 6 has high valuations for items 4 and 0.

Let's allocate based on these observations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 6
- Agent 5: Item 1
- Agent 6: Item 4
- Agent 0: Item 8
- Agent 2: Item 2

This allocation ensures that every agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [4]
}
```
