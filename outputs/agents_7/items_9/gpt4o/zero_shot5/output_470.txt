Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  76  81  41  26  69   3  11  95
1  52  17  70  14  55  40  67  49  37
2  19  28  10  24  72  46  85   9  21
3  34  14  95  66  45  28  57  88  61
4  72  65  10   0  39  36  46  34  47
5  39  47  93  18  12  46  65  14  76
6  41  12  17  69  77  72   5  43  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method by maximizing the total value each agent receives. We aim to distribute the items such that the sum of the values assigned to each agent is relatively balanced.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Determine which agent values each item the most.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

Let's go through each item:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 4 (value 72)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (value 76)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 3 (value 95)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 6 (value 69)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 6 (value 77)
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 6 (value 72)
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 2 (value 85)
- Item 7: Highest value by Agent 3 (value 88)
- Item 8: Highest value by Agent 0 (value 95)

Let's allocate these items to the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [],
    "6": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while also making sure each agent has a chance to receive items.
