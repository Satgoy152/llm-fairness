Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  70  67  39  94  18  97  83  44
1  92  27  13   3  56  15   6  40  13
2  44  93   9  55  37  28  91  36  56
3  37  48  53  55  12  21  11  50  77
4  11  48  50   1  27  94  98  53  56
5  13  13  15  65  73  12  80  40   3
6  38  93  59  63  52  88  62  94  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (measured by the values provided) is as balanced as possible. Given the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items and that all 9 items must be allocated, a potential allocation strategy is as follows:

1. Identify the highest value for each item across all agents and try to allocate the item to the agent who values it most.
2. Ensure that each agent is allocated at least one item, if possible, to balance distribution.

Here is a potential allocation based on the valuations given:

- Item 0 has the highest value (92) for agent 1.
- Item 1 has the highest value (93) for agents 2 and 6. Allocate to agent 2.
- Item 2 has the highest value (67) for agent 0.
- Item 3 has the highest value (65) for agent 5.
- Item 4 has the highest value (94) for agent 0.
- Item 5 has the highest value (94) for agent 4.
- Item 6 has the highest value (98) for agent 4.
- Item 7 has the highest value (94) for agent 6.
- Item 8 has the highest value (77) for agent 3.

After ensuring a fair allocation with minimal conflicts, here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, maintaining fairness based on their valuations.
