Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  50  57  86  59  41  59  58  73
1  69  63  33  90  30  47  87  65  86
2  81   0  20  96   4  91  88   0  81
3  28  13  47  41  73  20  33  64  90
4  63  85  14  63  67  51  91  38  16
5   5  77  72  68  36  35  65  91  76
6  39  70  78  35   6   2  66  45  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we will attempt to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations, trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least some items if possible.

Let's start by considering some potential allocations based on the highest valuations:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0 (99).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 3 (90).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (96), but since it's already allocated, we'll consider the next highest.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 8 (90).
5. Agent 4 highly values item 6 (91).
6. Agent 5 values item 7 the highest (91).
7. Agent 6 values item 2 the highest (78).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items, ensuring each agent gets at least something:

- Agent 0 has item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 1, next highest after item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 5, next highest after item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 4, next highest after item 8.
- Agent 4 gets item 6.
- Agent 5 gets item 7.
- Agent 6 gets item 2.

Now we have allocated all items and each agent has been considered for at least one item. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [8, 4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [2]
}
```
