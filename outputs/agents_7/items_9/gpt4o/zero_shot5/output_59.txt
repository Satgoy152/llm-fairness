Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  59  65  83  89  54  89  41  49
1  79  88  43  97  71  88  90  48  10
2   6  11  60  65  66  39  86  44  70
3  90  48   7  95  21  25  95  36  69
4  59  52  44  50  89  74  32  24  68
5  14  25  67  31  56  66  95   0  36
6  70  16   0  45  53  55  40  60   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple round-robin method based on the highest valued items for each agent. The goal is to ensure each agent gets at least one item where possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest-valued items for each agent and start by assigning those.
2. Ensure no agent gets more items than others until all have at least one item if possible.
3. Distribute any remaining items based on the next highest preference.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value is for item 4 (89). Assign item 4.
- Agent 1: Highest value is for item 3 (97). Assign item 3.
- Agent 2: Highest value is for item 6 (86). Assign item 6.
- Agent 3: Highest value is for item 0 (90). Assign item 0.
- Agent 4: Highest value is for item 4 (89), already taken. Next highest is item 5 (74). Assign item 5.
- Agent 5: Highest value is for item 6 (95), already taken. Next highest is item 2 (67). Assign item 2.
- Agent 6: Highest value is for item 0 (70), already taken. Next highest is item 7 (60). Assign item 7.

Now, each agent has at least one item. We still have two unallocated items: 1 and 8. Let's distribute based on remaining high values:

- Agent 1: Next highest available is item 1 (88). Assign item 1.
- Agent 3: Next highest available is item 8 (69). Assign item 8.

The allocations are now complete:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [7]
}
```
