Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  72  58  99  38  52   5  69  73
1  97  35   8  87  60  88  74  93  22
2  61  10  84  36  33  57  63  41  23
3  62  89  91  28   2  47  53  97  62
4  24   6  40  71  18  45  44  24   1
5  75  71  62  24  85  49  58  12  18
6  63  91  59   3  69  67  18  64  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Since there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest value item for each agent.
2. Assign these items to the respective agents if they are not already taken.
3. Allocate the remaining items to the agents with the next highest value preferences.

Let's go through this process:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 3 (99).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 0 (97).
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 2 (84).
4. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 7 (97).
5. Agent 4 has the highest value for item 3 (71), but item 3 is already assigned to Agent 0. The next highest is item 5 (45).
6. Agent 5 has the highest value for item 4 (85).
7. Agent 6 has the highest value for item 1 (91).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 are allocated.
- Remaining items are 6 and 8.

Agents with one item: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
Agent 3 has already one item but can hold another because of high preference.

Allocate item 8 to Agent 3 as it has the second highest value for it (62).
Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 as it has a high preference for it (74).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [1]
}
```
