Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  81  27  67   5  37  10  82  84
1  49  30  55  52  34   4  24  30  88
2  81  56  21  94  29  96  79  88  80
3  50  47  62  15  59  76  89  90   0
4  37  12   7  74  56  52  31  29  28
5  24  53  41   1  45  44  96  85  42
6  49  29  67  46   5   7  98  68  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations. We'll ensure that each agent receives at least one item where possible, and that the total number of items allocated equals 9.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent an item for which they have the highest valuation, ensuring no conflicts in assignment.
2. If all agents have been assigned at least one item, distribute the remaining items based on the next highest valuations while ensuring no agent receives more than 2-3 items unless necessary.

Let's go through the process step by step:

- Agent 0: Values item 0 the most (87), assign item 0.
- Agent 1: Values item 8 the most (88), assign item 8.
- Agent 2: Values item 5 the most (96), assign item 5.
- Agent 3: Values item 7 the most (90), assign item 7.
- Agent 4: Values item 3 the most (74), assign item 3.
- Agent 5: Values item 6 the most (96), assign item 6.
- Agent 6: Values item 6 the most but it's already taken, next highest is item 2 (67), assign item 2.

At this point, all agents have been assigned one item, and we have allocated 7 items. We need to allocate 2 more items:

- Remaining items are 1 and 4. Check the next highest valuations for these items:
  - For item 1: Agent 0 values it at 81.
  - For item 4: Agent 3 values it at 59.

Assign item 1 to Agent 0 and item 4 to Agent 3. This completes the allocation of all 9 items.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7, 4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2]
}
```
