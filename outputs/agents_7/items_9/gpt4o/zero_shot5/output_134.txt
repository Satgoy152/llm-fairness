Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  85  34  23  16  88  57  63  65
1   2  51  99  86  43  79   4  27  13
2  15  23  70  53  77  43  85  31  14
3  45  51  97  26  43  36  20  25  57
4  90  10  88  70  12  69  11  53  36
5  31  45  99  70  95   3  46  54  76
6  95  12  33  53  75  23  69  56   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly. We can achieve this by considering each agent's preferences and attempting to maximize overall satisfaction.

First, let's rank the items for each agent based on their valuations, then allocate the items according to priority, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and no item is allocated more than once.

**Valuation Table:**

| Agent | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0     | 51 | 85 | 34 | 23 | 16 | 88 | 57 | 63 | 65 |
| 1     | 2  | 51 | 99 | 86 | 43 | 79 | 4  | 27 | 13 |
| 2     | 15 | 23 | 70 | 53 | 77 | 43 | 85 | 31 | 14 |
| 3     | 45 | 51 | 97 | 26 | 43 | 36 | 20 | 25 | 57 |
| 4     | 90 | 10 | 88 | 70 | 12 | 69 | 11 | 53 | 36 |
| 5     | 31 | 45 | 99 | 70 | 95 | 3  | 46 | 54 | 76 |
| 6     | 95 | 12 | 33 | 53 | 75 | 23 | 69 | 56 | 2  |

**Proposed Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuations for items are 5 and 1.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuations for items are 2 and 3.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuations for items are 6 and 4.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuations for items are 2 and 8.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest valuations for items are 0 and 2.
6. **Agent 5:** Highest valuations for items are 2 and 4.
7. **Agent 6:** Highest valuations for items are 0 and 6.

**Final Allocation:**

To ensure each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed, let's assign the items as follows:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 6.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 1).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (since Agent 4 will get the next item to ensure all items are distributed).

**JSON Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [0, 7],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all 9 items are allocated.
