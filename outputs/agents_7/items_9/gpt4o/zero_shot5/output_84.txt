Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  37   2  49  36  76  49  25  89
1  25  70  35  16   7  27   9   8  94
2  48  68  48  62  48  49  80  68  17
3  43  46  27   4  11  53  73   2   5
4  58  90  30  78  45  71  82  83  20
5   3  98  63  88  82  74  86  37  63
6  47   1  21  19  68  97  42  37  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that balances the total value received by each agent. Given the constraints, each agent should receive an integer number of items, and all 9 items must be allocated.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 8.
2. **Agent 1** values item 8 highly.
3. **Agent 2** shows relatively balanced valuations, but item 6 stands out.
4. **Agent 3** has some higher values for items 5 and 6.
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 the most.
6. **Agent 5** has highest valuations for item 1.
7. **Agent 6** has high valuations for item 5.

Given these considerations, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [3]
- Agent 2: Items [6]
- Agent 3: Items [2]
- Agent 4: Items [4]
- Agent 5: Items [1]
- Agent 6: Items [5, 7]

This allocation distributes all 9 items and considers each agent's preferences. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [5, 7]
}
```
