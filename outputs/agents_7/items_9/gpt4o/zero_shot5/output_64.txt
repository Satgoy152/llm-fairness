Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  99  43  61  37  97  55  36  96
1  54  12  72  32  18  89  34  53  78
2  80  88  33  53  80  44  50  89  39
3  26  62  46   5  81  27  91  15  71
4  75  51  68  53   5  65  58  68  36
5  75  14  15  60  65  82  41  62  57
6  62  48  79  46  85  69  77   4  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we can use a simple heuristic approach. One way is to allocate items to the agents based on their highest valuation for an item that hasn't already been allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 99)
2. Agent 1 gets item 5 (value 89)
3. Agent 2 gets item 7 (value 89)
4. Agent 3 gets item 6 (value 91)
5. Agent 4 gets item 0 (value 75)
6. Agent 5 gets item 3 (value 60)
7. Agent 6 gets item 8 (value 87)

Since there are 9 items and only 7 agents, one agent will have to receive an additional item. We can assign the remaining items to the agents with the next highest valuations:

8. Agent 2 gets item 4 (value 80)
9. Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 43)

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize the total valuation for the agents.
