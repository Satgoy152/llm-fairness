Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  92  18  46  10  30  98   6  34
1  46  52  10  38  13  25  49  77  98
2  78  42  29  45  18  46  33  86   3
3  64  53  25  63  99  54  45  20  71
4  18  86  58  12   8  84  61  45  83
5  26  59  43  80  66  30  23  39  94
6  70  40  24  16  62  87  72   8  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items while considering their valuations. The challenge is to ensure that all 9 items are allocated and that the allocation is as equitable as possible based on the agents' valuations.

To achieve this, we can look at each agent's highest-valued items and attempt to allocate those items to them, ensuring no item is allocated more than once. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the most at 98.
2. Agent 1 values item 8 the most at 98.
3. Agent 2 values item 7 the most at 86.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the most at 99.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the most at 86.
6. Agent 5 values item 8 the most at 94, but since item 8 is already taken, we look at item 3 at 80.
7. Agent 6 values item 5 the most at 87.

Let's assign these items accordingly:

- Agent 0 gets item 6.
- Agent 1 gets item 8.
- Agent 2 gets item 7.
- Agent 3 gets item 4.
- Agent 4 gets item 1.
- Agent 5 gets item 3.
- Agent 6 gets item 5.

Now, we have allocated 7 items, and 2 items (0 and 2) remain unallocated. We need to allocate these two remaining items to the agents:

- Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 0.
- Agent 5 can take item 2 as it has a reasonable valuation.

Now the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3, 2],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item.
