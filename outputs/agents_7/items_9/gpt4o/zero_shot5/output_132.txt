Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  20  66  61  57  28  14  11  92
1  28  33  34  12  60  71  53  76  65
2  32  39  54  93  74  51  50  68  52
3  60  33  90  65  82  23  15  74  80
4  54  50  31  12  82  16  54  33   5
5   0  12  16  31   4  33  27  84  18
6  49   2  51  82  21  33  93  70  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 9. There are many ways to allocate these items, but one approach is to maximize the total valuation for all agents combined while ensuring fairness.

Let's start by allocating based on the highest valuation for each agent:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 8.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 7.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 2.
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for items 4 and 5.
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 7 (already taken) and next highest for item 5 (already taken).
7. Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 6.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items based on the next highest valuations:

- Agent 0 can take item 0.
- Agent 1 can take item 5.
- Agent 2 can take item 1.
- Agent 3 can take item 8.
- Agent 5 can take item 4.
- Agent 6 can take item 0 (already taken) or item 3 (already taken), so it takes item 5 (already taken) or item 1 (already taken).

Finally, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [7, 5],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [],
    "6": [6]
}
```

Note: Agent 5 ended up with no items, and the allocations utilize all 9 items.
