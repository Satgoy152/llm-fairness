Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  75  33  72  93  68  92  18  54
1  14  87  96  29   9  50  22  91  35
2  50  59  20  71  20  81  35  89  77
3  36  94  77   0  59  36  42  31  62
4  55  15  49  37  83  44  35  10  81
5  51  65  35  17  10  59  97  22  42
6  50   2   5  56  78   2  75  85  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives some items, and the total value of items each agent gets is as balanced as possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Calculate the total value of items for each agent.
- Allocate items to agents, aiming to balance these total values.

Here's an example of such an allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [3]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 6, valued at 93 and 92 respectively.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 7, valued at 96 and 91 respectively.
- Agent 2 receives items 5 and 8, valued at 81 and 77 respectively.
- Agent 3 receives item 1, valued at 94.
- Agent 4 receives no items.
- Agent 5 receives item 0, valued at 51.
- Agent 6 receives item 3, valued at 56.

This allocation attempts to keep the total value received by each agent somewhat balanced.
