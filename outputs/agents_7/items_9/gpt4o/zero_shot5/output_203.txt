Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  94   0  41  14  88  68  40  42
1  61  16  95  80  34  77  76  99  27
2  49  85  70  30  79  56  55  46  13
3  85  11  23  48  21  88  20  81  97
4  82  42  20  86  10  42  96  13  93
5  68  73  39  87  43  79  22  68  91
6  61   5  55  63  67  19  87   7  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations while also distributing all 9 items.

Here's one way to make the allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Try to assign items to maximize overall satisfaction for each agent.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: [5] - (88)
- Agent 1: [7] - (99)
- Agent 2: [1, 2] - (85, 70)
- Agent 3: [8] - (97)
- Agent 4: [6] - (96)
- Agent 5: [3] - (87)
- Agent 6: [0, 4] - (61, 67)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item where possible and that the items are distributed as evenly as possible based on their values.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [0, 4]
}
```
