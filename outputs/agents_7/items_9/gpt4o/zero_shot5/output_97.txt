Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  92  12  66  53  37  24   7  68
1  96  41  42  24  60  92   3  73  89
2  32  48  86  62  41  58  40   0   7
3   2  86  25  68  72  67   4   9  37
4  24  14  59  16  59  27  40  97  16
5  83  24   8  39  88  91  62  72   0
6  11  30  47  46  78  92  24  50  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

To achieve this, we can follow an approach where we assign items to the agents based on their highest valuations. We will allocate one item at a time, ensuring no item is assigned more than once, and we will attempt to distribute items fairly among the agents. 

Here is one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (92)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (96)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (86)
- Agent 3: Item 4 (72)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (97)
- Agent 5: Item 5 (91)
- Agent 6: Item 8 (99)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (68)
- Agent 5: Item 6 (62)

This allocation is designed to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated. 

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5, 6],
    "6": [8]
}
```
