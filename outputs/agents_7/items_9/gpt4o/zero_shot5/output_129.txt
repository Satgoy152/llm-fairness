Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  59  10  38  95  20  28  88  20
1  79  57  65  95  57  43  54  25  40
2  43  98  58  81  13   6  50   9  53
3  18  45  95  90  91  67   9  37  56
4  69  66  60  77  30  33  39  61  82
5  55  40  40  48  86   0  81  34   5
6  85  79  55  54  94  21   3  80  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the preferences given in the table and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 7 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We should attempt to maximize the total value for each agent while distributing the items fairly. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued items to the agents who value them most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Ensure the total number of allocated items is 9.

Let's analyze the table to determine a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 values item 4 at 95, which is their maximum value.
- Agent 1 values item 3 at 95, which is their maximum value.
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 98, which is their maximum value.
- Agent 3 values item 2 at 95, which is their maximum value.
- Agent 4 values item 8 at 82, which is their maximum value.
- Agent 5 values item 6 at 81, which is their maximum value.
- Agent 6 values item 0 at 85, which is their maximum value.

Based on this, let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 gets item 4.
2. Agent 1 gets item 3.
3. Agent 2 gets item 1.
4. Agent 3 gets item 2.
5. Agent 4 gets item 8.
6. Agent 5 gets item 6.
7. Agent 6 gets item 0.

Now, we have allocated 7 items. We need to allocate 2 more items. We will choose items that maximize the remaining values for the agents who haven't yet received their highest preferences or can still benefit more:

- Agent 0 can get item 7 (value 88).
- Agent 6 can get item 5 (value 21).

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share, and all items are allocated. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0, 5]
}
```
