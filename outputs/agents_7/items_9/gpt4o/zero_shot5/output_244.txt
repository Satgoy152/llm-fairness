Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  37  92  75  66   2  19  43   4
1  42  94  93  41  91  38  83  42  16
2  91   9  87  51  19  46  85  75  84
3  46  83  22   6  63  74  69  29   2
4  90  48  55  90  55  37  99  98  29
5   7  74   2   9   1   3  68  68  95
6  51  11  98  22  36  51  89  51  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the following approach: 

1. **Calculate Each Agent's Total Valuation:** Calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent.
2. **Rank the Items for Each Agent:** For each agent, rank the items based on their individual valuation.
3. **Iterate Over Each Item:** Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most and hasn't reached their fair share of items yet.

Let's go through the steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent
- **Agent 0:** 61 + 37 + 92 + 75 + 66 + 2 + 19 + 43 + 4 = 399
- **Agent 1:** 42 + 94 + 93 + 41 + 91 + 38 + 83 + 42 + 16 = 540
- **Agent 2:** 91 + 9 + 87 + 51 + 19 + 46 + 85 + 75 + 84 = 547
- **Agent 3:** 46 + 83 + 22 + 6 + 63 + 74 + 69 + 29 + 2 = 394
- **Agent 4:** 90 + 48 + 55 + 90 + 55 + 37 + 99 + 98 + 29 = 601
- **Agent 5:** 7 + 74 + 2 + 9 + 1 + 3 + 68 + 68 + 95 = 327
- **Agent 6:** 51 + 11 + 98 + 22 + 36 + 51 + 89 + 51 + 74 = 483

### Step 2: Rank the Items for Each Agent
For each agent, rank the items based on their valuation. Due to space limitations, I'll skip displaying all the ranking details here but will use them in the item allocation.

### Step 3: Allocate Items

Allocate items to agents based on who values them the most while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items (at least 1 item since there are 9 items and 7 agents).

- **Item 0:** Best valued by Agent 2 (91).
- **Item 1:** Best valued by Agent 1 (94).
- **Item 2:** Best valued by Agent 6 (98).
- **Item 3:** Best valued by Agent 4 (90).
- **Item 4:** Best valued by Agent 1 (91). Since Agent 1 already received one, it goes to the next best, Agent 0 (66).
- **Item 5:** Best valued by Agent 3 (74).
- **Item 6:** Best valued by Agent 4 (99). Since Agent 4 already received one, it goes to the next best, Agent 6 (89).
- **Item 7:** Best valued by Agent 4 (98). Since Agent 4 already received one, it goes to the next best, Agent 2 (75).
- **Item 8:** Best valued by Agent 5 (95).

### Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed based on the highest valuations.
