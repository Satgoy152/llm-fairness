Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  65  48  95  56  74  99  36  40
1  68   8  45  15  86  46  70  45  48
2  78   8   8   6  31  75  22   9  57
3  66  38  17  65  53  98  26  16  98
4  65  49  91  41  41  98  94  93  75
5  42  80  19  82  63  45   6  40  32
6  72  44  76   1  69  91  77  66   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 44 76  1 69 91 77 66  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents while maximizing their individual valuations, we can follow a strategy of allocating items based on the highest value for each item among the agents. We will ensure that all items are allocated and each agent can receive zero or more items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Item 3: Value 95
   - Item 6: Value 99

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Item 4: Value 86

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Item 0: Value 78

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Item 5: Value 98
   - Item 8: Value 98

5. **Agent 4:** 
   - Item 2: Value 91

6. **Agent 5:** 
   - Item 1: Value 80

7. **Agent 6:** 
   - Item 7: Value 66

Now we have allocated all 9 items. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 8],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [7]
}
```
