Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  88  30  78  44  98  24  46   1
1  98  29  34  86  88  88  63  10  55
2  39  48  73   7  62   0  29  25  55
3  80  26   6  57  10  89  84  45  39
4  84  62  59  56  18  51   7   7  32
5  21  99  79  18  65  47  45  78  25
6   7  23  81  73  20  28   5  83  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly while also distributing the items so that each agent gets an approximately equal number of items. Given the constraints (9 items and 7 agents), it's inevitable that some agents will end up with more items than others. Here's one possible allocation that attempts to balance both fairness in terms of agent valuations and distribution of items:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (98) and item 0 also highly (96).
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (98) and item 4 also highly (88).
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (73).
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (89).
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the highest (84).
6. Agent 5 values item 1 the highest (99).
7. Agent 6 values item 8 the highest (90).

Based on the above considerations, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 5, 0
- Agent 1 gets items: 4
- Agent 2 gets items: 2
- Agent 3 gets items: 3
- Agent 4 gets items: (none)
- Agent 5 gets items: 1, 6
- Agent 6 gets items: 7, 8

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and attempts to distribute them based on agent preferences. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 6],
    "6": [7, 8]
}
```
