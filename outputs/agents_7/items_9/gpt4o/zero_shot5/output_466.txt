Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  88   5  61  67  28   7  77  92
1  15  40  71  37  33  86   2  25  52
2  79  78  91  35  10  15  63  63  89
3  68  70  56   9   8  18  10  30  43
4  76  16  50  13  88  77  21  13  68
5  61  77   2  62  64  36  28  46  74
6   5  12  67  51  84  58   2  81  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly while making sure that each agent gets at least one item. Given that there are 7 agents and 9 items, two agents will receive two items each, and the rest will receive one item each.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest (95).
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest (86).
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest (91).
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the highest (70).
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the highest (88).
6. **Agent 5** values item 3 the highest (62).
7. **Agent 6** values item 8 the highest (96).

With one item assigned to each agent, we have:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [3]
- Agent 6: [8]

Items 6 and 7 remain unallocated. We need to allocate these items to two agents who can benefit the most from additional items:

- Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation (63) for item 6.
- Agent 6 has a high valuation (81) for item 7.

Thus, the allocation becomes:

- Agent 2: [2, 6]
- Agent 6: [8, 7]

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [8, 7]
}
```
