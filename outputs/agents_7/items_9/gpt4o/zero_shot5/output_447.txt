Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  15  98  71  65  23   0  12  33
1  88  85   7  22  97  66   9  98  45
2  61  69  53   7  64  90  39  56  80
3  72  87  24  29  83   8  43  50  75
4  30  65  11  51  79  62   4   3  17
5  64  15  71  53  65   2   1  31  29
6  42  19  43  14  58  11  21  14  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can utilize a method that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A simple approach is to allocate items in a way that each agent ends up with one or more items based on their highest valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the table of valuations:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most, provided it hasn't been allocated already.
2. If any items are left unallocated, continue assigning them based on the next highest valuations until all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (98).
- Agent 1 values item 7 the most (98).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (90).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (87).
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most (79).
- Agent 5 values item 2 the most, but it is taken, so next is item 3 (53).
- Agent 6 values item 4 the most, but it is taken, so next is item 0 (42).

Continue allocating based on highest remaining valuations:

- Agent 0 gets item 8 (33).
- Agent 1 gets item 6 (9).
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (61).
- Agent 3 gets item 8 (75), but it is taken, so next is item 0 (72).

Now each agent has been assigned at least one item, and all 9 items have been allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.
