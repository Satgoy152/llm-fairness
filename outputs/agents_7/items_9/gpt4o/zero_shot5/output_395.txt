Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  45  71  97   6  79  52  72  73
1  92  38  82   1  67   8  33  93  78
2  69  30  56  67  35  73  60  17   1
3  40  49  44  24  22  62  50  66  58
4  79  22  78  24  18  95  22  81  80
5  47  15  86  87  86  96   8  39  38
6   5  36  95  57  67  82  27   2  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the valuations table as a guide. The goal is to give each agent items that have high values for them while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most, ensuring no two agents get the same item.
2. Distribute the remaining items, considering the next highest values for each agent and ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (97).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (92).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (73).
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly (62), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 1 (49).
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest (95), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 8 (80).
- Agent 5 values item 5 the highest (96), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 3 (87), but it's taken, so we try item 2 (86).
- Agent 6 values item 2 the highest (95), but it's taken, so we try item 5 (82), which is taken, then item 8 (68), but it's taken. We consider item 4 (67).

After this initial allocation, we need to make sure all items are assigned and verify each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: item 3
- Agent 1: item 0
- Agent 2: item 5
- Agent 3: item 1
- Agent 4: item 8
- Agent 5: item 2
- Agent 6: item 4

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- Item 6 and 7 remain. Assign them based on the next highest value:
  - Agent 0 could take item 6 (52).
  - Agent 6 could take item 7 (2).

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.
