Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  61  76  33  41  54  77  14  28
1  14  37  29  89  65  32  66  50  66
2  89  34  17  42  16  36   0  16  66
3  10  80  41  61  21   9  90  12  30
4  18  88  45  55  57  12  22  62  81
5  58  75  53   5   8  21  27   1  31
6  59  64  58  21  10  61  52  58  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed. We'll try to allocate items so as to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring fairness.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent receives if they were to receive each item.
2. Try to assign items so that agents receive items they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 89).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (value 88).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 76).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 89).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 65).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 6 (value 61).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (value 90).
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (value 62).
9. Assign item 8 to Agent 4 (value 81).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value highly, and each item is distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 7, 8],
    "5": [],
    "6": [5]
}
```
