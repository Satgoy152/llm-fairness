Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  96   1   7  71   5  38  57  17
1  21  88  93  42   1  61  55  61  79
2  74  32  98  64  62  63  29  60  10
3   2  10  85  30   7  91  34  49  29
4  65  63  19  46  66  81  17  84  51
5  62  57  30  88  71  94  46  83  72
6  73  75  61  76  86  31  90  39  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. However, since there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

We'll proceed with an iterative approach to ensure a balanced allocation:

1. Start by assigning each agent one item that they value highly.
2. Allocate the remaining items to the agents who value them the most, trying to ensure fairness.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent one item they value highly:
   - Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 96)
   - Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 93)
   - Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 74)
   - Agent 3 gets item 5 (value 91)
   - Agent 4 gets item 7 (value 84)
   - Agent 5 gets item 4 (value 71)
   - Agent 6 gets item 6 (value 90)

2. Allocate the remaining items (3 and 8):
   - Item 3 can go to Agent 5 (value 88) since they have fewer items than Agent 6 who also values it highly.
   - Item 8 can go to Agent 1 (value 79) since they have fewer items than Agent 6 who also values it highly.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4, 3],
    "6": [6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and we have distributed all 9 items.
