Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  38  30  91  98  96  44  26  67
1  95   7  22  67  16  98  47  57  38
2  80  21  65  60  53  12  73  45  84
3  88  33   6  34  62  62  35  98  85
4  27  71  44  95  65  85  25   9  63
5  87  81  24  78  69  35  74  18  96
6  25  93  31  45  49  20  70  82  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Given that there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item while others may not receive any.

Let's proceed with a fair allocation based on the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 highly (98), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 highly (98), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 8 highly (84), so we allocate item 8 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 7 highly (98), so we allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 highly (95), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 8 highly (96), but it is already taken, so we allocate item 1 (81) to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6** values item 1 highly (93), but it is already taken, so we allocate item 7 (82), but it is already taken, so we allocate item 6 (70) to Agent 6.

After allocating these items, the remaining items are 0, 2, and 6. 

- **Agent 0** also values item 0 (37) highly, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 2** values item 6 (73) highly, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 4** can take item 2 (44), as other higher preferences are already assigned.

Let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [8, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3, 2],
    "5": [1],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
