Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  19  74  54  55  71  74  40  11
1  50  88  47  59  98  62  71   3  42
2  19  54  46   0  65  33  27  45  14
3  30  35  61  53  59  33   9  19  70
4  12  38   7  19  18  78  74  31  39
5  76  52  51  24  34  14  96  54  67
6  37   4  40  23  67  53  33  60  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, given there are 9 items and 7 agents. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has a very high valuation for item 4.
3. **Agent 2** has a reasonable valuation for item 1.
4. **Agent 3** values item 8 the most.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 highly.
6. **Agent 5** values item 6 highly.
7. **Agent 6** values item 7 the most.

Allocating based on these preferences, we ensure that each agent receives at least one item and the allocations are fair based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item that they value, with some agents receiving more than one item based on their top preferences and remaining available items.
