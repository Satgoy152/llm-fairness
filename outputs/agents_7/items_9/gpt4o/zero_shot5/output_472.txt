Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  97  40  26  42  43  98  54  53
1   7   9  75  53  28  34  43   0  81
2  76  15  59  91  89  81  57  57  48
3   7   5  89   2   9  86  52  81  23
4  12  89  52  50  40  31  89  84  25
5  41  76  99  60  69  58  65  88  43
6  16  83  15   0  62  82  38  34  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a greedy approach that prioritizes assigning items based on the highest valuation per item. This method aims to maximize the total satisfaction for all agents, although it may not ensure that each agent receives an equal number of items. We will make sure that each agent is considered and that all items are allocated.

Here's one way to perform the allocation:

1. Consider each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most, provided that this does not result in any agent receiving more items than others unnecessarily.
2. Continue this process until all items are assigned.

Now, let's allocate the items to the agents:

1. Item 0 is most valued by agent 0 (93).
2. Item 1 is most valued by agent 0 (97).
3. Item 2 is most valued by agent 5 (99).
4. Item 3 is most valued by agent 2 (91).
5. Item 4 is most valued by agent 2 (89).
6. Item 5 is most valued by agent 3 (86).
7. Item 6 is most valued by agent 0 (98).
8. Item 7 is most valued by agent 5 (88).
9. Item 8 is most valued by agent 1 (81).

Let's ensure that each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0 already has items 0, 1, and 6.
- Agent 1 has item 8.
- Agent 2 has items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3 has item 5.
- Agent 4 does not have an item, so let's allocate item 4 to agent 4 instead of agent 2, and give item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 5 has item 7.
- Agent 6 does not have an item, so let's reallocate item 2 from agent 2 (who still has item 3) to agent 6.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.
