Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  72  29  98  30  60  28  58  44
1  53  56  20  85  66  63   5   4  55
2  24  34  41  93  24  92  96   5   1
3   8  37   0  67  12  87  32  15  74
4  35  21   6  80  99  92  49  99  53
5  79  27  62   4   2  81  71  17   9
6  26  65  81  37  41  93  38  28  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. We can use a method that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) and ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation for an item that hasn't been allocated yet.
2. Make sure all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Following these steps, here's a fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 6.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 8.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 4.
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 5.
- Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Then allocate remaining items 1 and 7 to the agents with lower allocations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is distributed, and agents receive items based on the highest valuations.
