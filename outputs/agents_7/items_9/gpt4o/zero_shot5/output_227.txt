Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  65  55   7  83  14  91  29  94
1  11  60  63  12  65  41  25  89  38
2  54  59  20  71  23  83  75  88  50
3  52  17  10  78  33  76  17  79  82
4  28  97  70  50  87  18  58  71  92
5  18  48  27   8   5  99  86  89   3
6  84  66  72  93  36  98   2  69  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we aim to maximize total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible. Given the constraints, we can use a greedy approach to assign items based on the highest value for each item across all agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0:** Highest value is 84 by Agent 6.
2. **Item 1:** Highest value is 97 by Agent 4.
3. **Item 2:** Highest value is 72 by Agent 6.
4. **Item 3:** Highest value is 93 by Agent 6.
5. **Item 4:** Highest value is 87 by Agent 4.
6. **Item 5:** Highest value is 99 by Agent 5.
7. **Item 6:** Highest value is 91 by Agent 0.
8. **Item 7:** Highest value is 89 by Agent 1.
9. **Item 8:** Highest value is 94 by Agent 0.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item where possible:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 8
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: No items (all items have been allocated)
- Agent 3: No items (all items have been allocated)
- Agent 4: Items 1, 4
- Agent 5: Item 5
- Agent 6: Items 0, 2, 3

This allocation ensures all items are distributed with maximum valuation priority.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
