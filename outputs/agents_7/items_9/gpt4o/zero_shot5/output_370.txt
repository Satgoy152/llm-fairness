Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  55  25  54  17  42   5  64   7
1  21  13  33  65   3   1  96   2  89
2  96  53  53  96  18  27  71  89  25
3  65  95  98  75   6  92  31  53  19
4  12  38  10  61   7  64  36  35  26
5  96  90  63  60  92  78  23   3  91
6   8  35  86  54  80  36  95  49  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach by first assigning each agent one item based on their highest valuation (preference). After each agent has at least one item, we can distribute the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent their highest valued item. 
2. Distribute the remaining items to ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and to maximize total valuation across agents.

Based on the valuations provided, here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Highest value is for item 0 (78).
- Agent 1: Highest value is for item 6 (96).
- Agent 2: Highest value is for item 0 (96), but it's taken, so the next is item 3 (96).
- Agent 3: Highest value is for item 2 (98).
- Agent 4: Highest value is for item 5 (64).
- Agent 5: Highest value is for item 0 (96), but it's taken, so the next is item 1 (90).
- Agent 6: Highest value is for item 6 (95), but it's taken, so the next is item 2 (86).

Now distribute the remaining items:

- Item 4: Assign to Agent 6, as it maximizes the fairness (80).
- Item 8: Assign to Agent 1, as it's the highest remaining preference (89).

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the distribution is as fair as possible given the valuations.
