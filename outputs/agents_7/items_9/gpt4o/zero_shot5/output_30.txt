Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  10  11  84   7  89  52  41  22
1  79  74  75  34  38   1  62  79  95
2   1  97  79  52  59  10  62  48  10
3  84  21  84  93   0  47  18  42  83
4  88  22  49  96  37  10  71  16  53
5  61  53  81  60  39   5  97  34  76
6   6  90  61  14  25  88  33  23   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 7 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and ideally, each agent receives items they value highly.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations are for items 3 (84) and 5 (89).
2. **Agent 1**: High valuations are for items 8 (95) and 0 (79).
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations are for items 1 (97) and 2 (79).
4. **Agent 3**: High valuations are for items 3 (93) and 0 (84).
5. **Agent 4**: High valuations are for items 3 (96) and 0 (88).
6. **Agent 5**: High valuations are for items 6 (97) and 2 (81).
7. **Agent 6**: High valuations are for items 1 (90) and 5 (88).

We need to assign items in a way that distributes them fairly among the agents, considering their preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 5 (highest value for Agent 0).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 8 (highest value for Agent 1).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 1 (highest value for Agent 2).
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 (highest value for Agent 3).
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 0 (high value for Agent 4).
- **Agent 5**: Assign item 6 (highest value for Agent 5).
- **Agent 6**: Assign item 2 (high value for Agent 6).

This leaves items 4 and 7, which must be allocated to complete the distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 4 (next available).
- **Agent 6**: Assign item 7 (next available).

Now, each agent has a fair allocation based on their preferences, and all items are assigned.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2, 7]
}
```
