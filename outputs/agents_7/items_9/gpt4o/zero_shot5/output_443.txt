Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  75  45  23  81  20  10  34  32
1  83  22  58  80  51  82  28  81   8
2  54  38  46  30  32  97  53  27  30
3  92   9  32  79  57  16  45  36   4
4  84  85   4  52  87  87  22  69  11
5  79  78  67  15  81   9  56  85  20
6   6  42  49  19  40  48  46  45  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation of items assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. This approach will distribute the items in a way that considers the preferences of the agents.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued item to each agent.
2. Ensure each agent has at least one item.
3. Distribute the remaining items to maximize the satisfaction of each agent.

Let's look at the valuations and assign items:

1. Agent 0: Highest value is 81 (Item 4)
2. Agent 1: Highest value is 83 (Item 0)
3. Agent 2: Highest value is 97 (Item 5)
4. Agent 3: Highest value is 92 (Item 0, but already taken, so next is 79 for Item 3)
5. Agent 4: Highest value is 87 (Item 4, but already taken, so next is 87 for Item 5, already taken, next is 85 for Item 1)
6. Agent 5: Highest value is 85 (Item 7)
7. Agent 6: Highest value is 49 (Item 2)

Now, allocate the remaining items to maximize each agent's total valuation:

- Remaining items: 1, 6, 8

Assign remaining items based on the next highest valuation:

- Item 1: Agent 4 (Next highest for Agent 4)
- Item 6: Agent 5 (Next highest for Agent 5)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (Next highest for Agent 0)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7, 6],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly based on the agents' valuations. Each agent receives at least one item, and a total of 9 items are allocated.
