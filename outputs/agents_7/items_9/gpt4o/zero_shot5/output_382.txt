Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  26  76  25   2  84  85  55  87
1  65   6  97  82  56  24  97  84  99
2  27   5   6  61   1  92  94  81  16
3  90  12  85  53  40  42  81  63  52
4  72   4  72  19  79  41  27  16  79
5  67  19  42  18   1  80  34  72  79
6  34  80  57  13  83   3  35  69  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we aim to distribute items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's start by considering each agent's highest-valued items and allocate them in a way that maximizes their individual satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0** values item 8 the most at 87.
2. **Agent 1** values item 8 the most at 99.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the most at 92.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the most at 90.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the most at 79.
6. **Agent 5** values item 5 the most at 80.
7. **Agent 6** values item 4 the most at 83.

Now, we will allocate items based on the next highest valuations and ensure all 9 items are distributed:

- Allocate item 8 to Agent 1 (highest value of 99).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value of 92).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (highest value of 90).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 6 (highest value of 83).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (highest value of 85).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (second highest value of 97).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 6 (highest value of 69).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (remaining item with value 6).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (remaining item with value 25).

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [8, 2, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has an integer number of items, with a total of 9 items distributed.
