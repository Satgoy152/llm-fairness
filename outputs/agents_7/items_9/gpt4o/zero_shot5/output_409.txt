Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  85  68  99  39  32  14   4  26
1  58  81  57  24   7  59  42  35  69
2  59  42  81  16  57   5  92  73  97
3  97  28  25   1  42  91  75  12  38
4  84  14  69  33  65  88  92  25  94
5   5  13  79  18  81  67  36  65  10
6  96  30  32  81   7  38  43  86  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation where each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to ensure that all 9 items are distributed among the 7 agents. One way to do this is by attempting to give each agent at least one of their top-valued items while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's a proposed allocation:

Agent 0: Assign item 3 (value 99)
Agent 1: Assign item 8 (value 69)
Agent 2: Assign item 2 (value 81)
Agent 3: Assign item 0 (value 97)
Agent 4: Assign item 5 (value 88)
Agent 5: Assign item 4 (value 81)
Agent 6: Assign item 7 (value 86)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining two items (1 and 6) to the agents who can derive substantial value from them without leaving any agent without a fair share. We can do this by considering the next highest available values:

Agent 0: Assign item 1 (value 85)
Agent 4: Assign item 6 (value 92)

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and that the distribution is fair based on the values given by each agent.
