Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  78  80  62   9  33  38   2  95
1   9  84  95   0  32  92  67  52   7
2   3  59  44  45  33  27  83  24  12
3  30  49  81   0  65  43  77  52  82
4  95   1  72  70   9  10  84  99  52
5  14  53  76  25  30  45  63  88  14
6  48  70   0  11  11  49  95  53  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we aim to balance the distribution while considering the agents' valuations of the items. Given no specific criteria for "fairness," a simple approach is to allocate one item to each of six agents and two items to one agent, ensuring that all 9 items are assigned.

Let's proceed with a possible allocation:

1. Assign items to agents who value them highly compared to others.
2. Ensure every agent receives at least one item, and manage the remaining items accordingly.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [8] (high valuation for item 8)
- Agent 1: [2] (high valuation for item 2)
- Agent 2: [6] (high valuation for item 6)
- Agent 3: [4] (reasonably high compared to others)
- Agent 4: [7] (highest valuation for item 7)
- Agent 5: [5] (reasonably high for item 5)
- Agent 6: [0, 1, 3] (high valuation for items 0 and 1, and takes item 3 as no one highly values it)

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items so that each agent receives at least one item, while also taking into account the relative valuations.
