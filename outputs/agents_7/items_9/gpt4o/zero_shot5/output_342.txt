Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  94  35  74  63   8  20   6  26
1  45  25  40  44  15  66  96  33   3
2  81  80   5  75  85  29  18  80  50
3  44  70  76  78  90  91   4  86  59
4   8   7  85  58   9  23  81  49  46
5  61  17  70  68  81  32  35  49  88
6  98  72  25  61  83  96  19  62  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated, we can follow a strategy that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring a balanced distribution of items. Here is one potential allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:
   - Item 0: Agent 6 (value 98)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (value 94)
   - Item 2: Agent 3 (value 76)
   - Item 3: Agent 3 (value 78)
   - Item 4: Agent 3 (value 90)
   - Item 5: Agent 6 (value 96)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (value 96)
   - Item 7: Agent 3 (value 86)
   - Item 8: Agent 5 (value 88)

2. After assigning items based on maximum valuation, there's a need to rebalance to ensure fairness.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 3, 4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [0, 5, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent has received items such that the allocation is based on their highest valuations while ensuring all items are distributed. Note that some agents may not receive any items if their valuations are consistently lower compared to others within the constraints of fair distribution.
