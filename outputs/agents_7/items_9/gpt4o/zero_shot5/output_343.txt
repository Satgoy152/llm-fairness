Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51   2  39  43  91  53  66  57  35
1  37  79  92  29  11  64  65   5  34
2  46  10  41  46  15  93  74  41  53
3  88  51  15  40  46  74  13  20  85
4   0  48  50  76  85  82  12  99  33
5  42  93  18  36   5  41  27  77  56
6  52  76  14  81  28  65  45  47  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value of all items, while also respecting the constraint that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

We can approach this problem by attempting to maximize the total value each agent receives, while also ensuring that each agent's allocated items are as close as possible to their highest valuations.

Let's calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 51 + 2 + 39 + 43 + 91 + 53 + 66 + 57 + 35 = 437
- Agent 1: 37 + 79 + 92 + 29 + 11 + 64 + 65 + 5 + 34 = 416
- Agent 2: 46 + 10 + 41 + 46 + 15 + 93 + 74 + 41 + 53 = 419
- Agent 3: 88 + 51 + 15 + 40 + 46 + 74 + 13 + 20 + 85 = 432
- Agent 4: 0 + 48 + 50 + 76 + 85 + 82 + 12 + 99 + 33 = 485
- Agent 5: 42 + 93 + 18 + 36 + 5 + 41 + 27 + 77 + 56 = 395
- Agent 6: 52 + 76 + 14 + 81 + 28 + 65 + 45 + 47 + 71 = 479

Now, let's allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's total value:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 4, 6, and 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 2, 1, and 5.
3. Agent 2 highly values items 5, 6, and 8.
4. Agent 3 highly values items 0, 8, and 5.
5. Agent 4 highly values items 7, 4, and 5.
6. Agent 5 highly values items 1, 7, and 8.
7. Agent 6 highly values items 3, 1, and 8.

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [7]
- Agent 5: [1]
- Agent 6: [3, 6, 8]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one of their highly valued items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [3, 6, 8]
}
```
