Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  83  19  26  65   9  22   2  79
1  20  25  19  58  87  27  56  81  11
2   4  89  61  94  40  97  28  49  40
3  20  31  21  44  57  65  70  89  14
4  55  10  19  58  61  82  59  72  39
5  90  49  43  78  70  75   3  23  20
6   4  97  14  72  30  60  74  31  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can follow a strategy that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent. We also need to ensure that all 9 items are allocated, and each agent can receive zero or more items.

Let's approach this by looking at the highest value each agent has for any item and try to allocate items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 1 (83)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value: Item 4 (87)
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value: Item 5 (97)
   
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value: Item 7 (89)
   
5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value: Item 5 (82) - already allocated to 2nd agent, choose next highest unique item: Item 6 (59)
   
6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest value: Item 0 (90)
   
7. **Agent 6**: 
   - Highest value: Item 1 (97) - already allocated to 0th agent, choose next highest unique item: Item 3 (72)

Now, we will allocate the remaining items in a way that maintains fairness:

8. **Remaining items**: 2, 8
   - Item 2: Allocate to Agent 6 (next highest value after item 3)
   - Item 8: Allocate to Agent 0 (next highest value after item 1)

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on agents' valuations and follows the constraints given.
