Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  31  36  28  80  31  27  67  74
1  34  12  72  17  87  31  75  83  18
2  14  78  26  42  57  20  10  90  17
3  24  29  98  33  68  25  83  58  82
4  21  17  16  34  28  35  17  57  93
5  86  31  59  87  30  86  69  48  34
6  46  90  27  71  36   2  71  82  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method to maximize the total valuation of items each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Given that there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. 

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is for item 4 (80).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is for item 4 (87). Since item 4 is already assigned to agent 0, we select the next highest, which is item 7 (83).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is for item 7 (90). Since item 7 is already assigned to agent 1, we select the next highest, which is item 1 (78).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is for item 2 (98).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is for item 8 (93).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for agent 5 is for item 0 (86).
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value for agent 6 is for item 1 (90). Since item 1 is already assigned to agent 2, we select the next highest, which is item 8 (92).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:
- Item 3 (28), item 5 (31), and item 6 (27) are unassigned.

We need to allocate these remaining items to minimize conflicts and distribute items fairly.

- Assign item 3 to agent 6, as they have higher interest in it (71).
- Assign item 5 to agent 0, as they have higher interest in it (31).
- Assign item 6 to agent 3, as they have higher interest in it (83).

Finally, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [3]
}
```
