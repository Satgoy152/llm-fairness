Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  95  31  15  80  20  98  26  60
1  58  33  37  66  92  99  26  80  19
2  95  28  36  51  39   9  20  50  95
3  77   9  54   9  10  27  89  69   6
4  99  21  27  28  27  92  24  44  75
5  53  29   5  12  48  36  65  83  94
6  69  26  83  36  52  34  66  37  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can start by aiming to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated. This can be approached using a greedy strategy or other allocation methods like Hungarian algorithm or even by iterating over possible allocations based on valuation.

Given the constraint that each agent can receive an integer number of items, we will allocate the items to maximize individual agent satisfaction while ensuring that all 9 items are distributed among the 7 agents.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy focused on maximizing the overall happiness of the agents:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent has a roughly equal number of items or as close to equal as possible.
3. Ensure that all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 6
- Agent 1: Items 5, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 8
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 3
- Agent 6: No items

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a chance to have items based on their valuations while making sure all 9 items are distributed.
