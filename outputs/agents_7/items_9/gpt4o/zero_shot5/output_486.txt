Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  91   2  55   7  39  94  95  10
1  53  57  64  91  50   5  73  78  80
2  54  59  22  43  12  15  57  33   3
3  55  22  14  39  25  70  10  16  12
4  24  99  35   9  70  21  98  55  27
5  16  30  39  23  54  70  54   4  69
6  39  70  14  46  51  33  69  80  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's try to maximize each agent's total valuation based on their preferences. We aim to distribute the 9 items among the 7 agents such that each agent gets at least one item, while some agents may get more based on their valuation preferences.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Preferably gets item 6 (value 94) and item 7 (value 95).
2. Agent 1: Preferably gets item 3 (value 91) and item 8 (value 80).
3. Agent 2: Preferably gets item 1 (value 59).
4. Agent 3: Preferably gets item 5 (value 70).
5. Agent 4: Preferably gets item 4 (value 70).
6. Agent 5: Preferably gets item 2 (value 39).
7. Agent 6: Preferably gets item 0 (value 39).

Based on these preferences, the allocations would look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
