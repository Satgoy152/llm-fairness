Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84   5   4  62  55  72  99  39  48
1  72  46  95  82  50  15  63  81  98
2  39  14  65  73  11  67  94  11  99
3  98  30  41  80  23  34  45  51  19
4  17  69  28  44  81   7  69  98  86
5  47  81  34  22  31  85   2  32  61
6  46  94  29  23  24  73  16  43   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. There are 9 items and 7 agents, so some agents will receive one item while others may receive two.

Here's a potential allocation strategy using a round-robin approach that considers each agent's highest-valued items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 6 (99).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 8 (98).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 8 (99). Item 8 is already taken, so next is item 6 (94).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 0 (98).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 7 (98).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 5 (85).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value is for item 1 (94).

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Second highest value is item 5 (72).
- **Agent 1**: Second highest value is item 2 (95).
- **Agent 2**: Second highest value is item 3 (73).
- **Agent 3**: Second highest value is item 3 (80).
- **Agent 4**: Second highest value is item 4 (81).
- **Agent 5**: Second highest value is item 1 (81).
- **Agent 6**: Second highest value is item 5 (73).

The allocation should be fair where possible, but note the overlap in desired items. To resolve this, some prioritization based on highest overall value can be considered.

Here's one way to allocate the items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 6 receives three items since some agents are allocated only one item and Agent 6 had the next highest value remaining items.
- All items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
