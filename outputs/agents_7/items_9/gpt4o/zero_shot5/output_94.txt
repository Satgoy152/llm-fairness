Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  66  84  62  46  24  78  51  57
1  19  65  75   8  79  82  53   2  27
2  64  32  41  30  19  26  62  89  26
3  39  82  77  58  16  52  77  59  16
4  13  60  29  42  61  14  63  71   2
5  47  13   4  56  82   6  79  35  59
6  76  94  66  30  58  38   9  51  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and exactly 9 items are distributed. A balanced approach is to first allocate items to the agents with the highest valuation for those items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest, so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest, so allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 7 the highest, so allocate item 7 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the highest, so allocate item 1 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest, so allocate item 4 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 6 the highest, so allocate item 6 to agent 5.
7. Agent 6 values item 0 the highest, so allocate item 0 to agent 6.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining two items (3 and 8) while balancing fairness:

8. Agent 3 values item 3 the second highest among unallocated items, so allocate item 3 to agent 3.
9. Agent 0 values item 8 (second choice) the highest among unallocated items, so allocate item 8 to agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items, with a focus on maximizing their valuations. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0]
}
```
