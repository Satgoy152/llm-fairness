Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  38  88  36  59  60  47  90  96
1  42  75  72  94  35  98   3   5  67
2  80  24   7  26  75  17  79  16  49
3  72  87  99  49  28   2  18  14  36
4  25  37  62  30  35  13  23  66  96
5  50  29  16  35  28  49  67  46  24
6  39  66  16  68  80  77  29  21  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider maximizing the total value each agent gets while ensuring all items are distributed. We'll try to allocate items such that each agent receives a reasonable share of their high-value items, considering each agent's preferences.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 7, and 8. We'll allocate items 7 and 8 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3, 5, and 1. We'll allocate items 3 and 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 0. We'll allocate item 0 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 2. We'll allocate item 2 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 8, but since it's already allocated, we'll give them item 4, which has a moderate value.
6. Agent 5 has a moderate valuation for item 6. We'll allocate item 6 to agent 5.
7. Agent 6 has a high valuation for item 4, but since it's already allocated, we'll give them item 1, which they have a moderate valuation for.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item (except agent 2, who receives item 0 only), and all 9 items are distributed.
