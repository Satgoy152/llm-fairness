Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  70  53  85  80  16  60  51  58
1  22   4  64   4  71  28  93  70  80
2  37  57  24  26  99  49  22  52  69
3  40  21  70  16   5  51   2  10  78
4  25  82  22  85  16  97  79  72  96
5  86  98  51  99  81  73  56  84  43
6  17  43  35  11  89  47  55  92  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17 43 35 11 89 47 55 92 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple strategy where each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing each agent's total value for their allocated items. Since we have 9 items and 7 agents, two agents will receive two items each, while the rest receive one item each.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Select item 3 (value 85), which is their highest valued item.
2. **Agent 1**: Select item 6 (value 93), which is their highest valued item.
3. **Agent 2**: Select item 4 (value 99), which is their highest valued item.
4. **Agent 3**: Select item 8 (value 78), which is their highest valued item.
5. **Agent 4**: Select item 5 (value 97), which is their highest valued item.
6. **Agent 5**: Select item 1 (value 98), which is their highest valued item.
7. **Agent 6**: Select item 7 (value 92), which is their highest valued item.

Now, we have 2 remaining items (0 and 2) to allocate. We will choose items based on maximizing the total value for those agents who have a relatively lower total value:

- **Agent 0**: Select item 0 (value 41) to increase their total value.
- **Agent 2**: Select item 2 (value 24) to increase their total value.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [7]
}
```
