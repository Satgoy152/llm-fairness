Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  87  76  80  25  51   7  93  35
1  94  22  97  91  21   7  61  64  47
2  66  14  28   1  21  79  90  51  84
3  85  84  63  10  38  72  21  94  10
4  46   8  48  12  15  47  14   2  12
5  95   5  26  72  98  67  14  71  99
6  49  15   1  64  46  50  68  30  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to give each agent items based on their highest valuations. However, since there are 7 agents and only 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others, but we will strive for the highest satisfaction.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent their highest valued item that hasn't yet been assigned.
2. Repeat the process, but prioritize agents who have fewer items to balance the allocation.

Following these steps, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 7 (highest value 93) and item 1 (next highest value 87).
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (highest value 97).
- Agent 2 gets item 6 (highest value 90).
- Agent 3 gets item 0 (highest value 85).
- Agent 4 gets item 4 (highest value 15).
- Agent 5 gets item 8 (highest value 99).
- Agent 6 gets item 5 (highest value 50).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [5]
}
```
