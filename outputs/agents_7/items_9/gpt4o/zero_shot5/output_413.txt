Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  94  14   6  71   1  81  91  60
1  53  27  55  75  93   2  54  85  87
2  21  35  17  45  61  86  55  82  90
3  96  47  54  15  34   8  62  77  27
4  32  28   3  33  93  39  76  43  28
5   1  39  53  34  91  93   9  57  84
6  42  68  10  42  67  17  22  21  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that balances the total value they receive. Given the table of valuations, one approach is to aim for an allocation where each agent receives approximately equal value, taking into account the differing valuations each agent has for the items.

Here's a potential allocation considering the goal of fairness in terms of total value:

- Agent 0: Items 7, 8
- Agent 1: Items 4
- Agent 2: Items 5, 6
- Agent 3: Items 0
- Agent 4: Items 3
- Agent 5: Items 1
- Agent 6: Items 2

This allocation distributes the items such that each agent receives items they value, with the goal of balancing the total value each agent receives. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [2]
}
```
