Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  87  12  73  73  28  95  14  88
1  66  91  38   9  32  31  39  53  11
2  26  95  98   5  93  59  82  31  60
3  78  79  60  86  99  96  32  89  21
4  11  55  82  73  99  75  81  57   0
5  29  28  50  27  49  33  63  76  41
6  50  89  83  35  66  17  34  19  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest-valued items for each agent.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.
3. Distribute remaining items to maximize total value.

Given the matrix of values, here's the allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 6 the most.
- **Agent 1** values item 1 the most.
- **Agent 2** values item 2 the most.
- **Agent 3** values item 4 the most.
- **Agent 4** values item 4 as well, but since agent 3 has more interest, we will allocate the next highest item for agent 4, which is item 6, already taken. The next highest is item 5.
- **Agent 5** values item 7 the most.
- **Agent 6** values item 8 the most.

Now, let's allocate the next highest valued items to distribute the remaining items:

- Allocate item 0 to agent 1 (second highest for agent 1).
- Allocate item 3 to agent 3 (second highest for agent 3).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives some valued items.
