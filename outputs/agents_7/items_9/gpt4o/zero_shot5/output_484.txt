Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  65  66  12  92  36  97  24  13
1  81  31  22  26  60  26  89  67  27
2  91  74  94  81  48  21  68  37  33
3  58  77  25  31  27  79  85  61  70
4  55  80  28  96  77  99  92  52  81
5  49  70  94  82  65  21   0  61  20
6  86  91  91  46  43  22   8  47   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. One common approach is to use the maximum valuations to guide the allocation process, aiming to maximize the total satisfaction.

Let's allocate items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 the highest, so we assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest, so we assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest, so we assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the highest, so we assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 the highest but it's already taken, so we assign the next highest available item, which is item 3, to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 2 the highest but it's already taken, so we assign the next highest available item, which is item 3, but it's also taken. We continue to the next highest available item, which is item 1, to agent 5.
7. **Agent 6** values item 1 the highest but it's already taken, so we assign the next highest available item, which is item 0, but it's also taken. We continue to the next highest available item, which is item 3, but it's also taken. We continue again to the next highest available item, which is item 4, to agent 6.

Now we have allocated 7 items. We need to assign the remaining 2 items:

- Item 8 is left, and we will assign it based on the next highest value that hasn't been assigned:
  - **Agent 3** values item 8 the next highest, so we assign item 8 to agent 3.

- Item 7 is left, and we will assign it based on the next highest value that hasn't been assigned:
  - **Agent 1** values item 7 the next highest, so we assign item 7 to agent 1.

Now we have allocated all 9 items.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [4]
}
```
