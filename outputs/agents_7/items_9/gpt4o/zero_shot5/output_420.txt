Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  98  85  52  91  50   0  81  29
1  33  73  24  24  64   4  22  65  20
2  26  83  38  21  49  39  56  63  78
3  49   6  40  33  57  74  51   1  34
4  63  58   2  55   3  21  14  76  87
5  96  77  79  50  59  46  93  94  80
6  31  79  62  20  29   7  51  87  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Since there are 7 agents and 9 items, some agents will get more items than others. We'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and that the total number of items allocated equals 9.

Let's distribute the items:

- Item 0: Agent 5 (value 96)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (value 98)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (value 85)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (value 52)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (value 91)
- Item 5: Agent 3 (value 74)
- Item 6: Agent 5 (value 93)
- Item 7: Agent 5 (value 94)
- Item 8: Agent 4 (value 87)

Redistribute to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0: [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [8]
- Agent 5: [0, 6, 7]
- Agent 6: [4]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [0, 6, 7],
    "6": [4]
}
```
