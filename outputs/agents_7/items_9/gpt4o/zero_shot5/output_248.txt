Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  49  21  12  75  90  24  96  40
1  93  90  31   7  10   4  87  94  58
2  63  55  70  28  73  21  15  75  27
3  47  17  90  84  10  72   7  96  26
4  20  79  90  30  56  23  12  84  52
5  98  47  40  10  41  21  14  64  17
6  77  83  73  43  18  18  49  70   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple algorithm that aims for each agent to receive items that are of relatively high value to them compared to others, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a proposed allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. If there's a tie, assign it to any of the agents tied for the highest value.

The allocations based on the highest valuations are as follows:

- Item 0: Agent 5 (value 98)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (value 49)
- Item 2: Agent 4 (value 90)
- Item 3: Agent 3 (value 84)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (value 75)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (value 90)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (value 87)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (value 96)
- Item 8: Agent 1 (value 58)

Now, let's format this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items have been assigned to agents according to their highest valuations, and every agent is included in the list, even if they receive no items.
