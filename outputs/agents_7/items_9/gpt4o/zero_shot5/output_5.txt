Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  68  27  13  94  64  12   8  86
1  86  46  58  17  88  33   3  74   4
2  30  59  73  34  10  27  70  66  30
3  50  35  67  85   7  84  30  49  53
4  42  72  35  18  77  74  96  25  85
5  22  32  81  49  26  54  15  43  62
6  65  77  31   3  54  44  63  70  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to distribute items such that each agent's total valuation is somewhat balanced, considering the limited number of items. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent.
2. Use a greedy approach to assign items to agents, prioritizing agents with lower current allocations and higher valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0: Allocate items 0, 4 (values: 45, 94)
2. Agent 1: Allocate items 1, 7 (values: 46, 74)
3. Agent 2: Allocate items 2 (values: 73)
4. Agent 3: Allocate items 3 (values: 85)
5. Agent 4: Allocate items 6 (values: 96)
6. Agent 5: Allocate items 8 (values: 62)
7. Agent 6: No items allocated

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [8],
    "6": []
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item (except agent 6 due to the limited number of items) and tries to balance the total valuation.
