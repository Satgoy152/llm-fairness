Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  42  58  19  36  43  33  41  71
1  32  77  65  72  47  45  21  42  48
2  58  94  81  10  60  91  67  45  34
3  20  80  16  35  44  47  28  43  64
4  33  12  41  91  86  84  14  36  82
5  74  61  18  35  21  87  84  65  39
6  73  94  28   4   2  23   9  91  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated according to the values they place on them. We will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent's allocation while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's a possible fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0: [8] (Value 71)
- Agent 1: [3, 1] (Values 72, 77)
- Agent 2: [5] (Value 91)
- Agent 3: [4] (Value 44)
- Agent 4: [7] (Value 36)
- Agent 5: [6] (Value 84)
- Agent 6: [0, 2] (Values 73, 28)

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0, 2]
}
```
