Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  65  63  26  78   6  24  44  29
1  53  67  48  91   7  70  27  32  26
2  36  48  68  88  84   5   0  97  87
3   3  10  28   5  47  77   6  15  74
4  71  88  59  37  10   4  41  32  12
5  96  10  42  89  26  53  31   1  15
6   7  67  58  64  20  75  14  97  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. However, since there are only 9 items and 7 agents, not every agent can receive an item. In this allocation, we will distribute the items based on the highest value each agent places on the items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 4 (value = 78).
2. Agent 1 receives item 3 (value = 91).
3. Agent 2 receives item 7 (value = 97).
4. Agent 3 receives item 5 (value = 77).
5. Agent 4 receives item 1 (value = 88).
6. Agent 5 receives item 0 (value = 96).
7. Agent 6 receives item 8 (value = 40).

For the remaining two items (2 and 6), we will assign them to agents who have not yet received an item or to those who have the next highest values:

8. Agent 0 also receives item 2 (value = 63).
9. Agent 1 also receives item 6 (value = 27).

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [8]
}
```
