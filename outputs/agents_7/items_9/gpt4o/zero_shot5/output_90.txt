Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  72   4  12   0  93  86  99   3
1  10  14  47  25  84  63  34  54  44
2  53  33  77  41  75  57  69  16  30
3  38  69  24  67  70  32  48  67  32
4  41  89  30  15  92  85  95  22  96
5  62  97  47  99  18  19  86  10  31
6   8   7  76  86  60  99  31  72  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we strive to maximize the satisfaction of each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 7 agents, a possible fair allocation could involve some agents getting slightly more items than others, ideally based on their highest valuations for the items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. Redistribute remaining items to balance allocations.

Here's a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 7 (valuations 94, 99)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (valuation 84)
- Agent 2: Items 2, 6 (valuations 77, 69)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (valuation 67)
- Agent 4: Item 8 (valuation 96)
- Agent 5: Item 1 (valuation 97)
- Agent 6: Item 5 (valuation 99)

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated while considering the agents' valuations.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [5]
}
```
