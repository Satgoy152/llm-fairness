Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  45  84  80  68  65  67  17  43
1  87  74  62  61  66  16  60  17  49
2  60  47  65  16  26  74   8  12  83
3  34  90  54  51  67  57   8  98  78
4  14  37   4  44  13  12  86  56  72
5   5  84  32  33  65  68  55  94  76
6  31  76  13  78  30  42   8  45  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while also making sure that all 9 items are allocated. One approach is to allocate items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 2 since they value it highly at 84.
- Agent 1 gets item 0 since they value it highly at 87.
- Agent 2 gets item 5 since they value it highly at 74.
- Agent 3 gets item 1 since they value it highly at 90.
- Agent 4 gets item 6 since they value it highly at 86.
- Agent 5 gets item 7 since they value it highly at 94.
- Agent 6 gets item 3 since they value it highly at 78.
- Agent 6 also gets item 8 since they value it at 37, which is relatively higher compared to other unallocated items for agents with fewer allocations.
- Agent 4 gets item 4 since they have no other items and value it at 13, which is their highest remaining unallocated item.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6, 4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are distributed.
