Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  41  23  24  95  54  76  52   4
1  32  18  16  53  60  93  34  43  67
2  46  88  28  83  46  46  50  85  84
3  58  52  79  29  37  54  30  18  28
4  40  85  48  56  27   0  47  94  18
5  18  68   9  85  73   5  18  22  59
6  68  68  88  39  16  39  55  57  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider using a method that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given there are 7 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others. Hereâ€™s one potential way to allocate the items:

1. Compute the highest value each agent places on any unallocated item.
2. Allocate the item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Repeat until all items are allocated.

Applying this method to the given table, we can proceed with the allocation as follows:

- Agent 0: Values item 4 most (95), allocate item 4.
- Agent 1: Values item 5 most (93), allocate item 5.
- Agent 2: Values item 1 most (88), allocate item 1.
- Agent 3: Values item 0 most (58), allocate item 0.
- Agent 4: Values item 7 most (94), allocate item 7.
- Agent 5: Values item 3 most (85), allocate item 3.
- Agent 6: Values item 2 most (88), allocate item 2.

Now, allocate the remaining items:
- Item 6 (valued highest by Agent 0 at 76) is allocated to Agent 0.
- Item 8 (valued highest by Agent 1 at 67) is allocated to Agent 1.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 7 agents.
