Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55   2  36  23  91  30  66  11  21
1  51  49  84  46   3  81  65  72  97
2  41  46  59  99  14  32  47  42  60
3   6  12   0  70  67  26  64  12  30
4  94  81  73   7  40   5  19  37  29
5  45  68  53  13  59  59  33  11  53
6  68  37  48  77  29  79  50   9  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [68 37 48 77 29 79 50  9 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to ensure that each agent gets items based on their higher valuations. We will also ensure that all items are allocated and each agent can receive at least one item if possible, keeping in mind the total number of items (9) and agents (7).

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 0 because it is their highest valuation.
2. Assign item 8 to agent 1 because it is their highest valuation.
3. Assign item 3 to agent 2 because it is their highest valuation.
4. Assign item 6 to agent 3 because it is their highest valuation.
5. Assign item 0 to agent 4 because it is their highest valuation.
6. Assign item 1 to agent 5 because it is their highest valuation.
7. Assign item 5 to agent 6 because it is their highest valuation.
8. Assign item 2 to agent 1 because they have the next highest valuation for an unallocated item.
9. Assign item 7 to agent 0 because they have the next highest valuation for an unallocated item.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [8, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [5]
}
```
