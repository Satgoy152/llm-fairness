Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  95   0  27  88  45  24  60  17
1  90  84  56  28  21  97  75  92  20
2  39  98  26   9  38  82   6  82   6
3   0  83  61  31  31   7  93  67  37
4  44  38  45  63  30  46   3  26   6
5   2  58  35  15  75  13  35  81  71
6  11  25  31  38   5  37  71  22  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. 

Let's examine the table to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 1 the highest (95).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 5 the highest (97).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 the highest (98).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 the highest (93).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 3 the highest (63).
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 7 the highest (81).
7. **Agent 6**: Values item 8 the highest (83).

To ensure fairness, we will start by allocating the highest valued item to each agent and then distribute the remaining items.

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 1
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 5
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 0 (second highest after item 1 which is already taken)
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 6
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 3
- **Agent 5**: Assign item 7
- **Agent 6**: Assign item 8

Now we have allocated 7 items, and 2 items remain (items 2 and 4). We will distribute these items to agents who might have a slightly lower total valuation.

- **Agent 0**: Has item 1 (95). Assign item 4 which has a value of 88 for agent 0.
- **Agent 3**: Has item 6 (93). Assign item 2 which has a value of 61 for agent 3, but this gives agent 3 two items and balances the allocation.

Now, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6, 2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing the total valuation based on the highest preferences.
