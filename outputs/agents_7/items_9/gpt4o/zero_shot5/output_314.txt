Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  38  38  36   0  61  97   6  64
1  73  74  26  97  51  57  20   5  69
2  63  28  33  46  39  42   5  60  16
3  80  15  17  33  27   4  93  79   5
4  67  58  26  52  95  27  95  89  34
5  14  32  88  78  70  52  81  21  60
6  57  89  66  34  44  45  83  25  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider maximizing the overall satisfaction or valuation each agent has for the items they receive. The goal is to distribute the 9 items in a way that is considered fair, ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences.

To achieve this, let's consider the highest valuations each agent has for the items and try to allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 6 (97) and 0 (72).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 3 (97) and 1 (74).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items 0 (63) and 7 (60).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers items 0 (80) and 6 (93).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers items 4 (95) and 6 (95).
6. **Agent 5**: Prefers items 2 (88) and 3 (78).
7. **Agent 6**: Prefers items 1 (89) and 6 (83).

By analyzing the preferences, we can start allocating items to maximize satisfaction while ensuring each item is allocated only once:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 since they value it the most.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 as it's the highest valuation for them.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 since they have a relatively high valuation for it.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3, as it's their highest preference.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4, given it's their highest preference.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 5, since it's their highest preference.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 6 because they value it the most.
- Now, assign item 8 to Agent 0 since they have the next highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4 as it's a reasonable allocation considering their needs.

The allocations will be:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 5],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed fairly across the agents, taking into consideration their highest preferences and ensuring that each item is assigned only once.
