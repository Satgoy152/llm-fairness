Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  48  21  13  98  58   9   0  55
1  77  83  85  97  55   2  99  11  19
2  17  16  84  84  41  13  61  78  18
3  21  96  82  49  19  82  49  17  95
4  94  96  68  51  75   4  40  39  29
5   9  43   3  20  76  70  66  83  70
6  18  11  37  49  55  67  95  27  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple allocation strategy where we try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all 9 items are distributed. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning the highest-valued item for each agent.
2. Continue assigning items to the agents in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

After analyzing the values and ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the total value, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 8 (values: 98, 55)
- Agent 1: Items 3, 6 (values: 97, 99)
- Agent 2: Items 2 (value: 84)
- Agent 3: Items 1 (value: 96)
- Agent 4: Items 0 (value: 94)
- Agent 5: Items 5 (value: 70)
- Agent 6: Item 7 (value: 27)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [7]
}
```
