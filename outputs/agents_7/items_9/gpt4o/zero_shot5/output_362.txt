Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  14  93  75  32  61  75  85  84
1  79  35  11   8  48  93   7   6  51
2  61  19  60  10  90  90  94  88  50
3  31  10  87   5  14  34  90  85  29
4  93   6  17  13  62  64  38  70  77
5   4  36  20  92  28  93  14  76  15
6  88  53   6  64  98  14  95  63  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. This is a complex problem that can be approached in various ways, but here is a possible allocation:

1. Start by ensuring each agent gets at least one item, focusing on the highest value item for each agent.
2. Allocate remaining items by maximizing the total value across all agents.

Let's identify the highest value item for each agent first:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (value 93)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (value 93)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (value 94)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (value 90)
- Agent 4: Item 0 (value 93)
- Agent 5: Item 5 (value 93)
- Agent 6: Item 4 (value 98)

Now, allocate these items and check for overlaps:

- Item 2 to Agent 0
- Item 5 to Agent 1 (as Agent 5 also values it highly, we'll need to adjust later)
- Item 6 to Agent 2
- Item 0 to Agent 4
- Item 4 to Agent 6

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 4 items ensuring no conflicts and all agents have at least one item:

- Agent 3 can have Item 7 (value 85)
- Agent 5 can have Item 3 (value 92, since Item 5 is already taken by Agent 1)
- Assign the remaining items 1 and 8 to agents who currently have fewer total values:

Agent allocations:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [0]
- Agent 5: [3, 1]
- Agent 6: [4, 8]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3, 1],
    "6": [4, 8]
}
```
