Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  23  52  98  66  70  93  12  12
1   7  94  23  87  79  90  34  81  93
2   5  62  57  39  76  66  55  10  58
3  86  22  63  37  79  82   7  71  20
4  27  45   2  97  69  28  38  61  27
5   1  60  11  11   3  94  22  78  81
6   8  54  13  91  55  86  99  58  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98 23 52 98 66 70 93 12 12]
 [ 7 94 23 87 79 90 34 81 93]
 [ 5 62 57 39 76 66 55 10 58]
 [86 22 63 37 79 82  7 71 20]
 [27 45  2 97 69 28 38 61 27]
 [ 1 60 11 11  3 94 22 78 81]
 [ 8 54 13 91 55 86 99 58 49]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 7 agents, we can aim to maximize the valuations each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated to one of the agents. We will go through a process to ensure each agent has a fair share of valuable items.

Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0:** High valuations for items 0 and 3.
2. **Agent 1:** High valuations for items 1 and 5.
3. **Agent 2:** Moderate valuation for item 2.
4. **Agent 3:** High valuation for item 8.
5. **Agent 4:** High valuation for item 4.
6. **Agent 5:** High valuation for item 7.
7. **Agent 6:** High valuation for item 6.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item with relatively high valuation to them, ensuring a fair distribution of the total value.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [6]
}
```
