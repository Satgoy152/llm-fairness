Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  51  53  38  48  98   5  88  24
1  63  52  91  28  13  81  79  19  43
2   1  55   8  21  19  56  84  11  39
3  95  38  34  98  79  82  41  45  98
4  20  50  69  21  65  47  17  81  42
5  74  19   8  71  39  74  99  29  15
6  37  27  49  79  64  98  14  99  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. One way to do this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation looks based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: The highest value is 97 by agent 0.
- Item 1: The highest value is 55 by agent 2.
- Item 2: The highest value is 91 by agent 1.
- Item 3: The highest value is 98 by agent 3.
- Item 4: The highest value is 79 by agent 3.
- Item 5: The highest value is 98 by agent 0.
- Item 6: The highest value is 99 by agent 5.
- Item 7: The highest value is 99 by agent 6.
- Item 8: The highest value is 98 by agent 3.

Now, let's assign the items based on these highest valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4, 8],
    "4": [],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most while respecting the constraint of exactly 9 items being allocated in total.
