Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  62  69  19  27  88  63  82  72
1   3  67   2  28   9  14  43   2  76
2  62  93  71  89  76  69  39  41  97
3  28  34  71  46  96  56  52   1  63
4  82  14  57  31  85  10  39  21  99
5   8  11  35  75  94  15  37  52   2
6  32  96  50  27  90  36  72  30  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are distributed. We can use a simple heuristic method to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent can get from all items.
2. Allocate items to agents such that the total value each agent receives is as equitable as possible.

Let's find a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Value for items - [83, 62, 69, 19, 27, 88, 63, 82, 72] 
2. Agent 1: Value for items - [3, 67, 2, 28, 9, 14, 43, 2, 76] 
3. Agent 2: Value for items - [62, 93, 71, 89, 76, 69, 39, 41, 97] 
4. Agent 3: Value for items - [28, 34, 71, 46, 96, 56, 52, 1, 63] 
5. Agent 4: Value for items - [82, 14, 57, 31, 85, 10, 39, 21, 99] 
6. Agent 5: Value for items - [8, 11, 35, 75, 94, 15, 37, 52, 2] 
7. Agent 6: Value for items - [32, 96, 50, 27, 90, 36, 72, 30, 54] 

Now, let's make sure to distribute the items fairly while ensuring all 9 items are allocated:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value: 83, highest among agents)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 6 (value: 96, highest among agents)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value: 69, highest among agents)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value: 89, highest among agents)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 5 (value: 94, highest among agents)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value: 88, highest among agents)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 6 (value: 72, highest among agents)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value: 82, highest among agents)
- Assign item 8 to Agent 4 (value: 99, highest among agents)

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute items such that the agents benefit from their highest-value items, making the distribution equitable.
