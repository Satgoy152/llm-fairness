Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  18  89  76  12  62  37  73  61
1  10  10  80  11   9  26  82  69  94
2  23  40  56   3  75  30  56  98  50
3  51  21  68  21  91  59  43  99  21
4   8  82  75  80  21   8  61  15  83
5  21  95   6  14  31  45  58  69  54
6  35  45  18  74  45  75  60  36  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a way that is as fair as possible. Given that there are 7 agents and 9 items, not all agents will receive an item, but we will try to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the valuations.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the highest-valued item for each agent.
2. Distribute items based on maximizing the total valuations for each agent, ensuring that every item is allocated exactly once.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 8
- Agent 2: Items 7
- Agent 3: Items 4
- Agent 4: Items 1
- Agent 5: Items 5
- Agent 6: Items 0, 6

Now, presenting the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and that the distribution is reasonably fair based on the given valuations.
