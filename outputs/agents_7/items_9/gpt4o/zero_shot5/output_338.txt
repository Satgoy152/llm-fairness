Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  22  73  58  18  79  56  33  65
1  70  63  88  90  72  16  25  67  86
2  98  29  22  22  23  32  87  34  95
3  90  89  68  33  18  93  43  87  11
4  21  14  78  18  40  87  41   8  47
5  28  90  52  27   7   4  18  21  86
6  22   7  44  81  99  83  83  97  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We will also consider the distribution of items such that agents receive items they value highly.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 receives item 0 (value 80), because it is the highest value item for this agent.
2. Agent 1 receives item 3 (value 90), because it is the highest value item for this agent.
3. Agent 2 receives item 8 (value 95), because it is the highest value item for this agent.
4. Agent 3 receives item 5 (value 93), because it is the highest value item for this agent.
5. Agent 4 receives item 2 (value 78), because it is the highest value item for this agent.
6. Agent 5 receives item 1 (value 90), because it is the highest value item for this agent.
7. Agent 6 receives item 4 (value 99), because it is the highest value item for this agent.
8. Agent 6 also receives item 7 (value 97), because they have the second-highest value for this item.
9. Agent 1 also receives item 6 (value 25), because they have the highest remaining value for this item.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of allocated items is 9.

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [4, 7]
}
```
