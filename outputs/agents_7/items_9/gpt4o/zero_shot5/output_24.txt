Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  42  68  25  60  79  87  35  33
1  19  82  78   8  65  77  26  16  83
2  18  90   2  35  73  44  44  97  11
3  67  74  94  72   2  10  87   0  17
4  81  53  97  19  97  14  47  42  91
5  53  76  18  79  98  32   0  19  92
6  28  20  40  41  76   1  87  82  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll aim to maximize the satisfaction of the agents by giving each agent items they value highly.

Here's a potential allocation plan:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation for each item.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure each agent has an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Agent 0: Values item 6 the highest (87).
- Agent 1: Values item 8 the highest (83).
- Agent 2: Values item 1 the highest (90).
- Agent 3: Values item 2 the highest (94).
- Agent 4: Values item 4 the highest (97).
- Agent 5: Values item 5 the highest (98).
- Agent 6: Values item 7 the highest (82).

This leaves item 0 and item 3 unallocated. We will assign them to the agents with the highest unmet needs:

- Agent 4 can also take item 0 (81).
- Agent 5 can also take item 3 (79) as it values it higher than the unallocated items.

Now, let's present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 4],
    "5": [3, 5],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned, and each agent receives an integer number of items, maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
