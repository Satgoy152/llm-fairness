Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  95  54  86  57  49  64  77  56
1   1  76  29  86  81  58  96  91  31
2  34  39   7  81  78   5  25  99  23
3  52  64  23  84  57  23  31  30  49
4  80  77   7  76  84  74  85  45  18
5  55  75  56  38   7  95  41  72  20
6  69  74   9  74  97   8   5   0  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives at least one item when possible, and the total number of items allocated equals 9. The goal is to maximize the individual agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, aiming for a fair distribution.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High Valuations:** Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations to maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated:** Make sure each item is allocated to one agent only.

3. **Balance and Fairness:** Try to distribute items so that each agent has at least one item if possible, given the constraints.

Based on this strategy, the allocation can be done as follows:

- Agent 0: The highest value for Agent 0 is on Item 1 (value 95).
- Agent 1: The highest value for Agent 1 is on Item 6 (value 96).
- Agent 2: The highest value for Agent 2 is on Item 7 (value 99).
- Agent 3: The highest value for Agent 3 is on Item 3 (value 84).
- Agent 4: The highest value for Agent 4 is on Item 6 (value 85), but since it's already taken, we go for the next highest, Item 4 (value 84).
- Agent 5: The highest value for Agent 5 is on Item 5 (value 95).
- Agent 6: The highest value for Agent 6 is on Item 4 (value 97), but since it's taken, we go for the next highest, Item 0 (value 69).

Now, let's assign the remaining items where agents have next highest valuations not yet assigned:

- Agent 1 also gets Item 8 (value 31).
- Agent 0 also gets Item 2 (value 54).

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and all items are allocated.
