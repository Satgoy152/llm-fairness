Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  41  55  55  28  15  55  86   2
1  29  38  42  85  63  10  17   0  55
2  52  32  26   1  98  72  99  25  66
3  15  54  41  34  95   4   2  33  88
4   6  20  29  55  33  46  36  17  53
5  58  85  20  62  30  74  53  25  64
6  66  60   6   2  56  19  87  82  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We have 7 agents and 9 items, so some agents will receive more than one item while others may receive none. Let's try to distribute the items based on maximizing the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations for items 0, 2, and 7. Let's assign item 7 to agent 0 (value 86).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 3. Let's assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 85).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 6. Let's assign item 6 to agent 2 (value 99).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 4. Let's assign item 4 to agent 3 (value 95).
5. **Agent 4**: Moderate valuations, can consider smaller valued items, allocate item 1 to agent 4 (value 20).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation for item 1, but it's taken. Next, highest for item 5. Let's assign item 5 to agent 5 (value 74).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation for item 0. Let's assign item 0 to agent 6 (value 66).

This leaves us with items 2 and 8 unallocated. We can distribute them based on remaining high valuations and fairness:

- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 55).
- Assign item 8 to agent 3 (value 88).

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0]
}
```
