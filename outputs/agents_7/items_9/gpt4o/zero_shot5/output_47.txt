Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  62  22  36  16  30  22  79  63
1  77  94  83  14  11  90  51   5  53
2  26  80  64  18  23  64  75   2  57
3   5  84  51  29  92  85  50  23  16
4  58  44  97  64  58  36  45   4  39
5  22  55  14  31  15  33  71  44  67
6  50  50  74   9  19  50  23  59  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuations, while also distributing the items as evenly as possible. Given that there are 7 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 1 and 7.
- Agent 1 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 2 has a higher valuation for item 6.
- Agent 3 values item 4 significantly.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 5 values item 8 highly.
- Agent 6 values item 0 relatively.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [1, 5]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: [8]
- Agent 6: [0]

This allocation attempts to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [0]
}
```
