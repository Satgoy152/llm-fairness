Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  98  40  41  62  78  20  61  31
1  65  53  57   2  47  85  29  23  62
2  98  45  35  14  48  87  33  65  63
3  79  41  89   1  90  83  60  77  29
4  32  69  76  11  99  55  33  32  59
5   8  68  88   2   4  59  89  81  79
6  69  20  11  15  62   3  90  44  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents based on the provided valuations, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's highest valued items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Since there are more agents than items, not every agent will receive an item. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 1 (98).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 5 (85).
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 0 (98).
4. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 4 (90).
5. Agent 4 has the highest value for item 4 (99), but since item 4 is assigned to Agent 3, we consider another high value, item 2 (76).
6. Agent 5 has the highest value for item 6 (89).
7. Agent 6 has the highest value for item 6 (90), but since item 6 is assigned to Agent 5, we consider another high value, item 0 (69).

After ensuring unique allocations based on the highest available values, we are left with allocating items 3, 7, and 8. We can assign these to any agents who still need items. Here is a possible allocation:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 6, who has a moderate value for it.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3, who has a high value for it.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 4, who has a moderate value for it.

Here is the allocation represented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [2, 8],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [3]
}
```
