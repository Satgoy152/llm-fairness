Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  64  64  30  97  81  98  67  36
1  83  61  49  69   7   5  23  81  73
2  43  50  49  75   2  61  71   5  44
3  57  53  60  86  76   8  24  95  82
4  10  82  98  18  12  84  26  68  99
5  17  29  59  95  75  28  69  96  92
6   9  15  88  13  31  28  71  86  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute them such that each agent receives items that maximize their total value, while also ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. We have 7 agents and 9 items, so some agents will receive more items than others. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values are highest for items 6, 4, and 5. Allocate item [6].
2. **Agent 1**: Values are highest for items 0, 7, and 8. Allocate items [0, 8].
3. **Agent 2**: Values are highest for items 3 and 6. Allocate item [3].
4. **Agent 3**: Values are highest for items 7, 8, and 3. Allocate item [7].
5. **Agent 4**: Values are highest for items 2, 8, and 7. Allocate item [2].
6. **Agent 5**: Values are highest for items 7, 3, and 8. Allocate item [5].
7. **Agent 6**: Values are highest for items 2, 7, and 6. Allocate item [1].

This ensures each agent receives an item and utilizes the maximum value for the agents that receive more than one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1]
}
```
