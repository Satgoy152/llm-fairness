Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  78   9   8  35  40   3  82  38
1  58  67  61  17  57  24  49  86  28
2  85  57  24  39  78  15  85  87  13
3  46  72  68  40  42  43  14  45  44
4  70   7  79  61  88  78   3  90  63
5  91  51  91  57   3  77  60  15  15
6  37  37  93  78  97   8  74   0  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to consider each agent's preferences and try to ensure that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly. We will aim for each agent to receive at least one item if possible, given there are 9 items and 7 agents.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 highly, so assign item 7 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 highly as well, but since it's already allocated, assign item 1 to agent 1, which is their second highest valued item.
3. Agent 2 values item 7 highly, but it's already assigned, so assign item 0 to agent 2, which is their next highest valued item.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 highly, but it's already assigned, so assign item 2 to agent 3, which is their next highest valued item.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 highly, but it's already assigned, so assign item 4 to agent 4, which is their next highest valued item.
6. Agent 5 values item 0 highly, but it's already assigned, so assign item 2 to agent 5, which is also already assigned, leave them for now.
7. Agent 6 values item 4 and item 2 highly, item 4 is already assigned, and item 2 is also assigned, so assign item 6 to agent 6.

Now, we need to check for unassigned items and agents with no items:

Unassigned items: 3, 5, 8
Agents with no items: Agent 5

Let's assign the remaining items:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 5, as Agent 5 values item 3 the next highest.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3, as it's their next highest valued unassigned item.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 6, as it's their next highest valued unassigned item.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated, respecting agents' preferences as much as possible.
