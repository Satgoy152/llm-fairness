Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  75  14  31  34  40  70  97  15
1  85  52  88  14  27  24  77  27  46
2   1  92  32   6   0  46  40  37  34
3  70  87  10   8  15  25  21  68  24
4  25  42  86  99  46  61  79  89  55
5  84  52  40  14  77  35  76  14  99
6  24   5  15  97  38  18  29  64  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items with highest valuations: 0 (80), 7 (97)
   - Allocate items: [0, 7]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items with highest valuations: 2 (88)
   - Allocate items: [2]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items with highest valuations: 1 (92)
   - Allocate items: [1]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Items with highest valuations: 3 (8), 4 (15)
   - Allocate items: []

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Items with highest valuations: 3 (99)
   - Allocate items: [3]

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Items with highest valuations: 8 (99)
   - Allocate items: [8]

7. **Agent 6**: 
   - Items with highest valuations: 5 (18), 6 (29)
   - Allocate items: [4, 5, 6] (Since items 4 and 5 are left, and 6 has relatively higher valuation for these)

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent gets items that have a high value to them while distributing all items.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [4, 5, 6]
}
```
