Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  85  59  50  11  42  59  78   0
1  97  14  16  91  26  49  25  68   6
2  36  68  29  15  69   9  12   2  23
3  21  90  50  24  56  75  52  60  40
4  95  46  87  92  62  95   2   7  97
5  14  99  89  14  79  41  47  51  76
6  45  22  71  30  46  33   2  43  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items. Given there are 7 agents and 9 items, most agents will receive at least one item, and some may receive more than others.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent assigns to any item.
2. Assign items starting with those that hold the highest value for any agent, ensuring that the distribution remains fair and each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 7.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 and 3.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 1.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 8.
6. Agent 5 highly values item 1.
7. Agent 6 highly values item 8.

Considering these preferences and ensuring a fair distribution, here is one allocation:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [8]
- Agent 5: [5]
- Agent 6: [6, 2, 7]

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6, 2, 7]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to an agent and considers the items' valuations by the agents.
