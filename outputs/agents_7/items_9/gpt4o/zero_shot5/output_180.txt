Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  96  81  36  39  37  73  77  22
1  38  77  79  90   4  63  11  93  20
2  62  12  32   8  97  86  85  69  82
3  69  53  39  80  79  72  90  77  69
4  33  26   5  19  66  23  73  57  41
5   8  74  26  64   8  25  58  44  67
6  44  20  51  15  52   1  27   7  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every item is allocated to exactly one agent. Below is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach ensures that each item is given to the agent who derives the most value from it, contributing to a fair distribution overall.

Here's the allocation for the 9 items:

- Item 0: Agent 3 (69)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (96)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (81)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (90)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (97)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (86)
- Item 6: Agent 3 (90)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (93)
- Item 8: Agent 2 (82)

Now, each agent receives items based on their highest valuation, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

The allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [4, 5, 8],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed fairly by considering the highest individual valuations, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
