Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26   7  83   2  61  52  27  80  57
1  59  35   3  60  49  52  40   3  77
2  57  65  87  15   9  97  34  46   4
3  64  99  95  56  88  26  69  40   6
4  65  59  63  63   3   6  45  60  93
5  95  87  36  83   5  68  26  31  73
6  38  13  68  83  31  53  93  85  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of allocated items is exactly 9. We aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations.

A possible approach is to allocate items to maximize the sum of valuations each agent receives, while ensuring every item is allocated exactly once.

Here is the allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 7]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [8]
- Agent 5: [0, 3]
- Agent 6: [4, 6]

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent gets an integer number of items.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [0, 3],
    "6": [4, 6]
}
```
