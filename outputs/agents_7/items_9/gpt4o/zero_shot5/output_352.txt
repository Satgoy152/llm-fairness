Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  13  92  12  76  74  65  33  28
1  33   8  49   8  77  59  14  64  92
2  51  85  36  21  62  26  19  68  23
3  55  77  87  68  64  92  49  97   4
4   5  14  80  65   0  49  56  94  19
5  29  60  63  64  72  53  69  79  41
6   5  43  56   4  55  10  57  62  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents, we will aim to distribute the items based on maximizing the total valuation, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 9 items and 7 agents, at least two agents will receive two items, while the others will receive one or none. Here's a reasonable allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [2, 4]
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 (92) and 4 (76).

2. **Agent 1**: Item [8]
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 8 (92).

3. **Agent 2**: Item [1]
   - Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1 (85).

4. **Agent 3**: Item [7]
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 7 (97).

5. **Agent 4**: Item [3]
   - Agent 4 has a relatively high valuation for item 3 (65).

6. **Agent 5**: Item [5]
   - Agent 5 has a relatively high valuation for item 5 (53).

7. **Agent 6**: Item [6]
   - Agent 6 has a high valuation for item 6 (57).

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6]
}
```
