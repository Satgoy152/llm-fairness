Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42   3  23  67  36  33  43  67  49
1  35  80  99  15  30  39  33  26  83
2  83  38  55   6  50   2  97  23  71
3  93  42  52  45  57  63  33  56  65
4  25  45  41  80  90  11  89  66  53
5  16  15  57  88  56  25  66  44  23
6  63  11  45  96  44  33  38  92  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets approximately the same total value of items, while also meeting the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's approach this step by step:

1. **Calculate the Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Sum the values of all items for each agent to understand their total valuation.

2. **Determine Fair Share:**
   - Calculate the fair share of total item value each agent should receive. The fair share is the total value of all items divided by the number of agents.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign items to agents in a way that each agent's total value of allocated items is as close as possible to their fair share while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation of items to agents:

- **Agent 0:** [0, 3, 7]
  - Total value: 42 + 67 + 67 = 176

- **Agent 1:** [1, 8]
  - Total value: 80 + 83 = 163

- **Agent 2:** [6]
  - Total value: 97

- **Agent 3:** [4, 5]
  - Total value: 57 + 63 = 120

- **Agent 4:** [2]
  - Total value: 41

- **Agent 5:** [9]
  - Total value: No item allocated, hence 0

- **Agent 6:** [9]
  - Total value: No item allocated, hence 0

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed and attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```
