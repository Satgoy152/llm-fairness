Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  20  76  10  49  50  56  74  10
1  48  29  19  36  74  26  61  90  32
2  26  13   7  60  43  47  12   6  20
3  59  93  54  64  38  17  19  70  46
4  67  23  19  47  84  50  97  76  96
5  59  66  81  10   1  17  77  73  83
6   8  99   6  22  53  92   5   0  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations for the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that optimizes their individual valuations while considering fairness. We will use a simple approach to distribute the items based on the highest valuations for each item.

Below are the allocations for each agent based on maximizing their respective valuations:

1. Assign items to agents where the agent has the highest valuation for an item.
2. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.
3. Distribute all 9 items among the agents.

Here is one way to fairly allocate the items based on the given table:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by agent 4 (67).
- Item 1: Highest valuation by agent 6 (99).
- Item 2: Highest valuation by agent 5 (81).
- Item 3: Highest valuation by agent 3 (64).
- Item 4: Highest valuation by agent 4 (84).
- Item 5: Highest valuation by agent 6 (92).
- Item 6: Highest valuation by agent 4 (97).
- Item 7: Highest valuation by agent 1 (90).
- Item 8: Highest valuation by agent 4 (96).

Taking into account the above, we can allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 4, 6, 8],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent potentially getting at least one item based on their highest valuation where possible.
