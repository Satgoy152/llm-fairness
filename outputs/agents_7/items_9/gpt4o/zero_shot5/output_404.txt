Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  81  43   0  95  20  66  15  64
1  16   5  42  34  91  79  16  29  22
2  13  89   3  55  55   5  12  81  37
3  53  39  63  62  76  50  77  71   7
4  30  99  35  52  74  37  13  97  13
5  62  20  36   0  57  63  45   4  72
6   5  65  80  60  57  53  40  69  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items so that each agent is satisfied relative to their preferences. Let's try to allocate the items such that each agent gets their preferred item if possible, while also ensuring that all items are allocated and no agent gets more than one item unless unavoidable. 

Based on the table provided, here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 4 values item 1 the most (99), so let's allocate item 1 to agent 4.
2. Agent 0 values item 4 the most (95), so allocate item 4 to agent 0.
3. Agent 6 values item 2 the most (80), so allocate item 2 to agent 6.
4. Agent 1 values item 5 the most (79), so allocate item 5 to agent 1.
5. Agent 3 values item 6 the most (77), so allocate item 6 to agent 3.
6. Agent 2 values item 7 the most (81), so allocate item 7 to agent 2.
7. Agent 5 values item 8 the most (72), so allocate item 8 to agent 5.
8. Agent 3's next highest value is item 3 (62), so allocate item 3 to agent 3.
9. Agent 0's next highest value is item 0 (78), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 7 agents, while trying to respect their preferences as much as possible.
