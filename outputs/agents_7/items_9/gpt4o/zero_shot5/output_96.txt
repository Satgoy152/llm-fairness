Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  22  79  74  96  64  94  24  93
1  34  66   5   8  49  84  62  80  67
2  13  20   7  45  75  16  10  89  21
3  81  27  76   3  26  71  55   8  16
4  65  72  64   9  95   7  15  62  26
5  25  82  85  47  27  96   0  53  17
6  38  46  88   9  44  90  77  33  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items. The goal is to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Here's a possible fair allocation based on the provided valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 4, and 8.
- Agent 1 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 7 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly, but since it's already allocated, they can have item 6.
- Agent 4 values item 4 highly, but since it's already allocated, they can take item 1.
- Agent 5 values item 5 highly, but since it's already allocated, they can take item 2.
- Agent 6 values item 2 highly, but since it's already allocated, they can take item 3.

Based on this reasoning, here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the 7 agents.
