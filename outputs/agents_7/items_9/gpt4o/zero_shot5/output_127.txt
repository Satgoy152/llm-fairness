Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  69  25  98  41  60  79  55  78
1  43  78  85  83   5  38  23  73  65
2  53  44  41  32  43  32  84  70  46
3  79  53  65  47   6  37  83  76   4
4  44  11  17  52  35  31  51  86  90
5  98  97  25   8  82  92  20  69  56
6  78   8   7  99  99  45  99  22  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Additionally, we want to ensure that the total number of items allocated is 9.

One straightforward approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Highest value is from agent 5 (98).
2. Item 1: Highest value is from agent 5 (97).
3. Item 2: Highest value is from agent 1 (85).
4. Item 3: Highest value is from agent 6 (99).
5. Item 4: Highest value is from agent 6 (99).
6. Item 5: Highest value is from agent 5 (92).
7. Item 6: Highest value is from agent 6 (99).
8. Item 7: Highest value is from agent 4 (86).
9. Item 8: Highest value is from agent 4 (90).

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible and adjust the allocation if needed:

- Agent 0: No highest value, allocate item 0 (83) instead of to agent 5.
- Agent 1: Already has item 2.
- Agent 2: No highest value, allocate item 5 (32) instead of to agent 5. This gives agent 2 at least one item.
- Agent 3: No highest value, allocate item 1 (53) instead of to agent 5. This gives agent 3 at least one item.
- Agent 4: Already has items 7 and 8.
- Agent 5: Reallocate item 1 and 5 to other agents, but keep item 5.
- Agent 6: Already has items 3, 4, 6.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7, 8],
    "5": [],
    "6": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has received at least one item if possible and the total number of allocated items is 9.
