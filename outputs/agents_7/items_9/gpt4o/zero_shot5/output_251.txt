Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  38  40  55  72  89  86  99  56
1  11  63  43  11  93   8  97  94  89
2  68  55  61  77  57  50  99   8  68
3  15   6  40  25  19  89  92  28  57
4  94  46  42  68   5  95  11  17  59
5  43  55  50  81  92  68  22  69  75
6  30  77  31  16  13  74  33  14  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in such a way that the total value each agent receives is balanced, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the table, we must allocate all 9 items, with each item going to one agent only.

One approach is to assign items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction by selecting items with the highest valuations for each agent, while also considering an overall balance in the distribution of value. Here's one possible allocation:

- Assign item 7 to agent 0 (value 99)
- Assign item 6 to agent 1 (value 97)
- Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value 61)
- Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value 89)
- Assign item 0 to agent 4 (value 94)
- Assign item 4 to agent 5 (value 92)
- Assign item 1 to agent 6 (value 77)
- Assign item 8 to agent 5 (value 75)
- Assign item 3 to agent 2 (value 77)

With this allocation, we ensure that all 9 items are distributed among the agents.

The allocations can be represented in the JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4, 8],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This configuration ensures that each agent receives at least some valuable items, and no items are left unallocated.
