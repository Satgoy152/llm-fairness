Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  43   0  47  47  23  50  71  28
1  60  98  17  22   8  78  67  72  67
2   6  91  52  97  50  87  23  11   7
3  25  38  30  83   0   3  97  78  39
4  41  63  55  58  19   7  97   3  21
5  18  34  18  44  63  68  85  29   7
6  88  15  34  91  37  30  39  38  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. We'll use a simple approach to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, and fairly distribute based on their preferences.

First, let's sort all possible allocations by the agent's value for the item in descending order. Then, we will assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 98.
2. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest at 97.
3. Item 6: Agent 3 values it the highest at 97.
4. Item 7: Agent 0 values it the highest at 71.
5. Item 0: Agent 6 values it the highest at 88.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the second highest at 87 (Agent 2 already has item 3, next highest is Agent 1 at 78).
7. Item 4: Agent 5 values it the highest at 63.
8. Item 8: Agent 6 values it the highest at 78.
9. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the highest at 52.

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [0, 8]
}
```
