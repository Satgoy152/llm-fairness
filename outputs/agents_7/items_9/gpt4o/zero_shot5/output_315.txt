Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  18  53  78  16  21  62  17  96
1  34  66  71  95  80   2  39  85  26
2  47  82  32  42  78  84  71  18  22
3  81  21  17  80  24  90  82  60  14
4   1  18  20  98  94  62  55  79  21
5  88  25  98   1  57  74  86   6  95
6   8  98  33   0  57  15  22  10   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a roughly equivalent total valuation from their allocated items. We also need to ensure that all items are allocated and each agent may get an integer number of items (including possibly zero).

Here is the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** is allocated items 8 and 3. (Sum of values: 96 + 78 = 174)
2. **Agent 1** is allocated item 4. (Sum of values: 80)
3. **Agent 2** is allocated items 1 and 5. (Sum of values: 82 + 84 = 166)
4. **Agent 3** is allocated item 6. (Sum of values: 82)
5. **Agent 4** is allocated item 7. (Sum of values: 79)
6. **Agent 5** is allocated item 2. (Sum of values: 98)
7. **Agent 6** is allocated item 0. (Sum of values: 8)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0]
}
```
