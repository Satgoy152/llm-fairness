Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66   8  20  84  32  40  68  77  92
1  51  83  65  15  61  62  88  89  41
2  53   6   0  85  60   7  45   1  24
3  22  28  18  69  73  27  83  40  63
4  37  32  36  73  88  12  20  57  61
5  58  95  54  92  64  95  82  20  63
6  82  47  56  94  40  26  56  98  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations provided in the table and distribute the items to maximize fairness. One approach is to allocate the items based on the highest valuation of each item by any agent, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

Let's start by examining each item and assigning it to the agent who values it the most:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 6 values it at 82, the highest. Assign to agent 6.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 5 values it at 95, the highest. Assign to agent 5.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 65, the highest. Assign to agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 6 values it at 94, the highest. Assign to agent 6.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 4 values it at 88, the highest. Assign to agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 5 values it at 95, the highest. Assign to agent 5.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 88, the highest. Assign to agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 6 values it at 98, the highest. Assign to agent 6.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 92, the highest. Assign to agent 0.

Now let's compile the allocations into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 5],
    "6": [0, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items and the distribution based on the highest valuation for each item.
