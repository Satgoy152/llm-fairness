Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  51   7  92  97  66  98  63  42
1  67  49  67  62  84  77  90  66  99
2  81  36   8  15  87  54  81  56  26
3   0  72  94  87  80   3  55  15  72
4  61  87  13  39  21  18  90  21  86
5  78  48  92   3  24   8   6  43  38
6  43  98  12  83  32  32  32  80  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets an approximately equal share of the total value or number of items. Given there are 9 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more items than others due to the indivisibility of items.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents by considering their preferences while ensuring each agent gets at least one item when possible.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values: 30 + 51 + 7 + 92 + 97 + 66 + 98 + 63 + 42 = 546
- Agent 1 values: 67 + 49 + 67 + 62 + 84 + 77 + 90 + 66 + 99 = 661
- Agent 2 values: 81 + 36 + 8 + 15 + 87 + 54 + 81 + 56 + 26 = 444
- Agent 3 values: 0 + 72 + 94 + 87 + 80 + 3 + 55 + 15 + 72 = 478
- Agent 4 values: 61 + 87 + 13 + 39 + 21 + 18 + 90 + 21 + 86 = 436
- Agent 5 values: 78 + 48 + 92 + 3 + 24 + 8 + 6 + 43 + 38 = 340
- Agent 6 values: 43 + 98 + 12 + 83 + 32 + 32 + 32 + 80 + 22 = 334

Now, we will distribute the items considering the agents' valuations, trying to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Let's assign the items:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [8, 6]
- Agent 2: [0, 7]
- Agent 3: [2, 3]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [5]
- Agent 6: []

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [8, 6],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": []
}
```

This distribution aims to allocate items fairly based on the agents' preferences and constraints given.
