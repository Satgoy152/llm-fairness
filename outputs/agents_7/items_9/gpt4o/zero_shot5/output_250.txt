Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  57  62  28  64  37   0  68  25
1  75  93  77  53   5  49  32   0  66
2  41  19  11  68  94  71  75  11  61
3  69  19  87  66  70   8  89  49  10
4  76  41  31  36   6  66  63  63  50
5  69  36  26  88  12  45  57  38  38
6  17   6   8  75   5  47  39  74  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can attempt to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given there are 7 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more than one item. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the item with the highest value for each agent.
2. Distribute the remaining items to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's proceed with this allocation process:

1. Assign the highest value item to each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 7 (value 68)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (value 93)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (value 94)
   - Agent 3: Item 6 (value 89)
   - Agent 4: Item 0 (value 76)
   - Agent 5: Item 3 (value 88)
   - Agent 6: Item 3 (value 75) 

Since item 3 and item 6 have been assigned twice, we must adjust the allocation:

- For Agent 6, instead of item 3, assign item 7 (value 74), which is the next highest value for Agent 6 and currently unassigned.
  
Now re-evaluate the allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 7
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 0
- Agent 5: Item 3
- Agent 6: Item 8

3. Allocate the remaining items (2, 5, and 9) to maintain fairness:
   - Agent 2 could take item 5 (value 71)
   - Agent 6 could take item 8 (value 62)
   - Agent 0 could take item 2 (value 62)

This allocation ensures each agent gets an item, and the remaining items are fairly distributed based on their preferences.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [8]
}
```
