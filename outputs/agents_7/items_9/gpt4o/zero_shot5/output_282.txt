Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  84  99  58  35  37  43  59  37
1  63  54  74  26  37   3  68  11  66
2   8  76   4  75   0  84  53  59  12
3  25  53  74  54  88  17  34  58  71
4  66  16  88  84  39  82  79  18   7
5  37   9  76  35  44  39  41  47  19
6  90  98  59  93  88  38  62  79  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 7 agents, we will try to distribute items such that each agent receives items that maximize their overall value. Since the number of items (9) is less than the number of agents (7), it is likely that some agents will not receive any items. The goal is to ensure that each item is allocated to an agent that values it highly, while attempting to distribute the items as fairly as possible among the agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 0 (values: 99, 33)
- Agent 1 receives item 8 (value: 66)
- Agent 2 receives item 5 (value: 84)
- Agent 3 receives item 4 (value: 88)
- Agent 4 receives item 6 (value: 79)
- Agent 5 receives item 3 (value: 35)
- Agent 6 receives items 1 and 7 (values: 98, 79)

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [1, 7]
}
```
