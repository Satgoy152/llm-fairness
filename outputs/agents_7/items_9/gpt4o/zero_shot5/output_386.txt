Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  72  83  19  98  54  74  57  53
1  96  53  87  60  73  21  31   8  40
2  22  91  85  52  18   8  64   8  16
3  56  28   2  19  30  37  77  50  57
4  26  37  33  44  95  80   3  30  74
5  46  14  17  86   7  44  24  16  14
6  62  52  64  20   0  61  11  65  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 72 83 19 98 54 74 57 53]
 [96 53 87 60 73 21 31  8 40]
 [22 91 85 52 18  8 64  8 16]
 [56 28  2 19 30 37 77 50 57]
 [26 37 33 44 95 80  3 30 74]
 [46 14 17 86  7 44 24 16 14]
 [62 52 64 20  0 61 11 65 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation would look:

Item 0: Highest value is 96 by Agent 1.
Item 1: Highest value is 91 by Agent 2.
Item 2: Highest value is 87 by Agent 1.
Item 3: Highest value is 86 by Agent 5.
Item 4: Highest value is 98 by Agent 0.
Item 5: Highest value is 80 by Agent 4.
Item 6: Highest value is 77 by Agent 3.
Item 7: Highest value is 65 by Agent 6.
Item 8: Highest value is 74 by Agent 4.
After assigning the items based on the highest value, the allocations are:
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5, 8],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [7]
}
```
This ensures each item is assigned based on the highest valuation by any agent, and all 9 items are allocated.
