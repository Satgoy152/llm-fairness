Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  33  13   5  13  13  55  80  89
1  56  46  14  20  57  48  15  26  83
2  17  85  80  55   6  64  15  31  81
3  46  23  97  72  31  84  33  51  83
4  54   1  14  75   1   2  34  51  69
5   4  70  74  23  41  94  33  44  99
6  32  19  72  81  65  82  81  79  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 7 agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can prioritize maximizing each agent's total valuation. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each item is only allocated once.
3. Ensure the total number of allocated items equals 9.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are for items 8, 7, and 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are for items 8, 4, and 5.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuations are for items 1, 2, and 8.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuations are for items 2, 5, and 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest valuations are for items 3, 8, and 7.
6. **Agent 5:** Highest valuations are for items 8, 5, and 2.
7. **Agent 6:** Highest valuations are for items 3, 6, and 5.

Given these preferences, we will allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0:** receives items [7, 0]
- **Agent 1:** receives item [4]
- **Agent 2:** receives item [1]
- **Agent 3:** receives items [2]
- **Agent 4:** receives item [3]
- **Agent 5:** receives items [8, 5]
- **Agent 6:** receives item [6]

This allocation maximizes the valuations for each agent while ensuring all 9 items are distributed.

Final allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [8, 5],
    "6": [6]
}
```
