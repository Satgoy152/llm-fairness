Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  52  35  53  15  27   4  44  46
1  44  73  71   8  28  57  31  37  85
2  14  44   6  57  62  90  26  72  97
3  83  34  25  53  72   9  48  23   0
4   8  60  33  83  68  65  73   1  68
5  37  77  90  21  62  75  44   8  70
6  32  77   4   8   3  88   4  56  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items as evenly as possible while taking into account each agent's valuations. We will ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Here is a potential fair allocation strategy based on the valuations provided:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 highly compared to others. Allocate item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 8. Allocate item 8 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 7 highly. Allocate item 7 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 0. Allocate item 0 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 highly. Allocate item 3 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 2 highly. Allocate item 2 to agent 5.
7. Agent 6 has a high valuation for item 5. Allocate item 5 to agent 6.

Now, we have allocated 7 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items (items 4 and 6):

8. Agent 4 values item 4 highly. Allocate item 4 to agent 4.
9. Agent 5 values item 6 reasonably high. Allocate item 6 to agent 5.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item where possible. Here is the final allocation presented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [2, 6],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation accounts for the valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed among the agents.
