Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  59  86  89  72  39  68  60
1  92   0  73  46  45  37  23  56
2  81  14  50  41  12  57  52  75
3  13  37  73  74  83  12  50  54
4  68  92  85  57  87  86  50  88
5  46  35  79  43  66  96  54  74
6  54  73  44  69  84   4   1  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the valuation each agent gets from the items allocated to them. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, or minimizing the number of agents without items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 89).
2. Agent 1 gets item 0 (value 92).
3. Agent 2 gets item 7 (value 75).
4. Agent 3 gets item 4 (value 83).
5. Agent 4 gets item 1 (value 92).
6. Agent 5 gets item 5 (value 96).
7. Agent 6 gets item 6 (value 94).

Now, we have allocated 7 items, and there is one item left: item 2. We can allocate this item based on the next highest valuation among the remaining items:

8. Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 86).

This ensures that all 8 items are allocated and the distribution is reasonably fair based on valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6]
}
```
