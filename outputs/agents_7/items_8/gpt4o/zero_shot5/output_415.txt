Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  65  23  80  94  49  68   2
1  12  71  42   5  79  48  98  72
2  27  65  51  27  70  37  86  16
3  29  73  55  47  90   0  65  95
4  37  44  79   9  46  65  53  46
5   6  45  71  93  90  66   4  59
6   4  56  29  77  58   9  56  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that every item is allocated and each agent can receive an integer number of items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the most (value = 93).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 the most (value = 98).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 the most, but item 6 is already taken by agent 1. The next highest valuation is for item 4 (value = 70).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 7 the most (value = 95).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 the most (value = 79).
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 3 the most (value = 93).
7. **Agent 6**: Values item 3 the most, but item 3 is already taken by agent 5. The next highest valuation is for item 1 (value = 56).

Now, we have allocated the following items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. We need to allocate one more item (item 5) to ensure all items are distributed.

Since item 5 is not yet allocated, we look at the highest remaining valuations for item 5:

- Agent 5 values item 5 as 66.
- Agent 4 values item 5 as 65.
  
Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 5, so we allocate item 5 to agent 5.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3, 5],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair allocation based on their highest values for the items, and all items are distributed.
