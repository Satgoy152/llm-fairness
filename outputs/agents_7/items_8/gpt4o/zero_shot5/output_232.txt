Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64   4  75  27  72  44  46   6
1  35  81  72  52  38   9  61  22
2  26  47  30  38  43   6  11  25
3   3  33  22  90  40  34  28  60
4  56  55  67  55  34  17  48  16
5  34  81  52  24  15  35  66  93
6  39  29   3   4   6  89  98  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items while ensuring every item is assigned to exactly one agent. Let's go through the valuations and make allocations based on maximizing each agent's total valuation.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 2 (75), 4 (72).
   - Allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 1 (81), 2 (72).
   - Since item 2 is already taken, allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Next highest available items: 6 (61).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 1 (47), 4 (43).
   - Both items are taken. Next highest available item: 3 (38).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: 3 (90).
   - Since item 3 is taken, allocate next available: 7 (60).

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (67).
   - Since item 2 is taken, allocate next most valued available: 0 (56).

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest valued items: 7 (93).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 5.

7. **Agent 6**:
   - Remaining items: 5.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 6.

Final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [],
    "6": [5]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to one agent, and the allocations aim to maximize the agents' valuations. Each agent receives at least one item where possible based on their highest valuations.
