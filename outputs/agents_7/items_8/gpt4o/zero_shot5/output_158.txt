Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  88   6  67  98  64  47  49
1  61  83  13  29  17   3  91  33
2  16  19  67   6  50  52  44  44
3  52  99  44  20  58  14  36  32
4  19  75  95  42  50  34  39  33
5  56  77  61  54  70  85  94  96
6  31  52  71  72  93  50  29  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we can aim to distribute the items such that the total value received by each agent is as equitable as possible. One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. However, since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive two items. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, keeping track of how many items each agent receives.
2. Attempt to balance the number of items each agent receives by reassigning items if necessary.

Using this method, we can arrive at the following allocation:

- Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 0.
- Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 3.
- Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 4.
- Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 6.
- Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 0.
- Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 5.
- Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 1.
- Item 7 is valued highest by Agent 6.

With these initial assignments, we can adjust slightly to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: [0, 4]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: [5]
- Agent 6: [3, 7]

Checking the balance, we see that Agent 2 currently has no items. We can reallocate one of the items from an agent with two items to Agent 2, ensuring everyone gets at least one item.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent receives at least one item, with the total number of items allocated being exactly 8.
