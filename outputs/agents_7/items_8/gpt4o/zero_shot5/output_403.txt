Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  25   2  84  99  27  52  41
1  44   3  52  67  58  32  85  88
2   5  70  28  79  97  64  86  13
3  23  82  87  81  99  95  43  35
4  21  66   2  33  39  74  69  12
5  42  87  96  59  51  79  99  51
6  88  69   9  66  15  54  20  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [44  3 52 67 58 32 85 88]

 [88 69  9 66 15 54 20 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item, given there are 7 agents and 8 items.

To do this, let's assign the items based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We'll attempt to do this iteratively, choosing the highest available item valuation for each agent until all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 4 (highest valuation for agent 0 is 99)
- Agent 1 gets item 7 (highest valuation for agent 1 is 88)
- Agent 2 gets item 6 (highest valuation for agent 2 is 86)
- Agent 3 gets item 5 (highest valuation for agent 3 is 95)
- Agent 4 gets item 1 (highest valuation for agent 4 is 66)
- Agent 5 gets item 2 (highest valuation for agent 5 is 96)
- Agent 6 gets item 0 (highest valuation for agent 6 is 88)
- Agent 3 gets item 3 (remaining item, highest valuation for agent 3 is 81)

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and we distribute the remaining item based on maximizing total value.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0]
}
```
