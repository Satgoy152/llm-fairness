Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  38  14  58  18   8   3  32
1  44  12  61  48  16  39  45  24
2  77  57  61  59  92  87  84  51
3  11  13  38  17  97  59  90  20
4  28  60  97   7   9  83  43  44
5  69  85  53  51  69  82  21  51
6  35  17  64  84  23  52  32   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we'll consider the valuations and try to distribute items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Prioritize giving each agent at least one item if possible, starting with the highest valuations.
2. Ensure no agent gets more than one more item than another, if possible, to maintain fairness.
3. Allocate remaining items considering the highest remaining valuations.

Here's one way to distribute the items:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 highly values item 2.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4 and 6.
- Agent 3 highly values item 5.
- Agent 4 highly values item 7.
- Agent 5 and Agent 6 should be considered for remaining items, looking at the highest valuations.

Let's assign items based on these considerations:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [4, 6]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [7]
- Agent 5: [1]
- Agent 6: [3]

This distribution gives each agent at least one item and tries to match items with high valuations where possible.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [3]
}
```
