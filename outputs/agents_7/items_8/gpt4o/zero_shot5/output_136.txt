Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43   5  54  58  44  71   4  18
1  36  75  34  28  50  78  36  43
2  37  35  50  20  33  63  25  10
3  29   9  13  47  21  90  36  18
4  41  94  77  37  67  51  18  20
5  25  54  97   6  29  40  39  32
6  77  16  85   2  20  80  14  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given there are 8 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive one item, and one agent will receive two items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items.
2. Allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing the individual agent's valuation for each item while considering the overall balance.

Based on the table, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 5.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 2.
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 3.
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 4.
- Agent 5 has the highest value for item 7.
- Agent 6 has the highest value for items 0 and 6.

Given the above analysis, here is the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 8 items distributed among the agents.
