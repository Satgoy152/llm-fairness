Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  82   1  40  45  46  32  96
1  28  99   2   6  12  55  29  12
2  61  67  86  23  23  29  92  70
3  39  99  33  67  72  82  22  63
4  12   1  27  77  43   7  83  64
5   2  59  27  73  42  79  60  79
6  27  56  93  84  70  44  87  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Each Agent's Top Preferences:** Look at each agent's highest valued items and try to allocate those first, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

2. **Balance the Allocation:** Make sure that all 8 items are allocated and that no agent is left out if there's a reasonable distribution.

3. **Ensure Fairness:** Attempt to distribute items so that each agent's total valuation for their allocated items is relatively balanced.

Now, let's create an allocation based on the table provided:

- Agent 0 values items 0 and 7 highly.
- Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 5.
- Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 6.
- Agent 3 highly values item 1 and item 5.
- Agent 4 values item 6 significantly.
- Agent 5 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 6's highest valuation is for item 2.

Considering these preferences, here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [5]
- Agent 6: [2, 7]

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and attempts to respect the agents' preferences as much as possible.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2, 7]
}
```
