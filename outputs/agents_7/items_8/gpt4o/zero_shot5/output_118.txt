Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  59  74  37  95  19  82  30
1  35  68  46  17   6  50  89  49
2  45  15  84  21  92  56   3  97
3  93  28  36  21  93  72  30  53
4  87  24  73  62  42   7  94  90
5  50  49  93  35  33  27  55  62
6  38  13  18  39  80  44  96  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total allocation is exactly 8 items. We also consider the valuations to ensure a balanced distribution. One common approach to achieve this is to start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. If an agent ends up with more items than another, we can redistribute to achieve fairness in terms of item count.

Here's a potential fair allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 (value 96, highest for this item)
2. Item 1: Agent 1 (value 68, highest for this item)
3. Item 2: Agent 5 (value 93, highest for this item)
4. Item 3: Agent 4 (value 62, highest for this item)
5. Item 4: Agent 0 (value 95, highest for this item)
6. Item 5: Agent 3 (value 72, highest for this item)
7. Item 6: Agent 6 (value 96, highest for this item)
8. Item 7: Agent 2 (value 97, highest for this item)

Now, let's verify the fairness of allocation in terms of count (each agent should ideally have one item, but some adjustments might be necessary given the constraints):

- Agent 0: 2 items (0, 4)
- Agent 1: 1 item (1)
- Agent 2: 1 item (7)
- Agent 3: 1 item (5)
- Agent 4: 1 item (3)
- Agent 5: 1 item (2)
- Agent 6: 1 item (6)

This distribution fairly allocates all items while respecting the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [6]
}
```
