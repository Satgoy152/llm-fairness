Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  99  44  11  87  51  11  88
1  88  50  35   9  46  60  97  45
2  54  85  51  93  20  76  42  38
3  27  31  49  31  27  57  21  54
4  38  63  58  75  68  26  60  86
5   0  34  99  82  92  64  68  15
6   0  63  28  47  66  64  79  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that takes into account agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least some value. Given the constraints, here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 has high value for items 1 and 7.
- Agent 1 highly values item 0.
- Agent 2 highly values item 3.
- Agent 3 doesn't have any outstanding high values, but item 5 is relatively higher.
- Agent 4 has a high value for item 6.
- Agent 5 highly values item 2.
- Agent 6 has moderate values for item 4.

Based on these observations, here's a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and attempts to respect the higher valuations for each agent.
