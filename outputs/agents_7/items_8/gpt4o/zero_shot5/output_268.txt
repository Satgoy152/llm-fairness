Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  46  17  21  56  29  55  53
1  75  63  17  90  72  50  64  85
2  47  67   1  92  45  64   7  97
3  84  74  38  86  52  72  52  32
4  92  52  63  79  87  82  51  47
5  91  60   4   5  79  46  23  46
6  42  52  47  48  17   8  17  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will get 2 items while the rest will get 1 item each. We should consider maximizing the total value of items allocated to each agent while ensuring fairness.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item.
2. Allocate the remaining item based on the next highest value that hasn't been assigned yet.

Let's use this approach:

- Agent 0's highest value is 56 for item 4.
- Agent 1's highest value is 90 for item 3.
- Agent 2's highest value is 97 for item 7.
- Agent 3's highest value is 86 for item 3, but item 3 is already taken. Next highest is 84 for item 0.
- Agent 4's highest value is 92 for item 0, but item 0 is already taken. Next highest is 87 for item 4, but item 4 is already taken. Next is 82 for item 5.
- Agent 5's highest value is 91 for item 0, but item 0 is taken. Next is 79 for item 4, but item 4 is taken. Next is 60 for item 1.
- Agent 6's highest value is 91 for item 7, but item 7 is taken. Next is 52 for item 1, but item 1 is taken. Next is 48 for item 3, but item 3 is taken. Finally, 47 for item 2.

After this allocation, we have items 6 left. We can allocate it to the agent with the next highest preference for an unallocated item.

- Agent 0's next highest value is 55 for item 6.

Now, let's display the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [2]
}
```
