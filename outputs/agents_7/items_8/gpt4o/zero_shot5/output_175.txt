Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  53  47  81  27   7  96  52
1  60  75  36  21  89  45  95   5
2   5  77  79  53  29  14  30  36
3  47  77   8  52  27  53   2  15
4  73  75  11  51  97  87  64  73
5  51  81  78  41  75  19  70  40
6  96  33  82  33  99   6  70  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we must ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. We'll aim to allocate based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 4, but it's taken. The next highest is item 5. Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 highly values item 1, but it's taken. The next highest is item 2, but it's taken. The next is item 6, but it's taken. The next is item 5, but it's taken. The next is item 4, but it's taken. The next highest is item 0. Allocate item 0 to Agent 5.
7. Agent 6 highly values item 4, but it's taken. The next highest is item 0, but it's taken. The next highest is item 6, but it's taken. The next highest is item 7. Allocate item 7 to Agent 6.

After allocating these items, we have allocated 7 items, and 1 item is left unallocated. Looking again, we see:

- Item 3 is unallocated.

We need to allocate the remaining item 3 to one of the agents that highly values it and hasn't received an item yet.

Agent 0 has already received item 6. Agent 1 has received item 4. Agent 2 has item 2. Agent 3 has item 1. Agent 4 has item 5. Agent 5 has item 0. Agent 6 has item 7.

Since each agent has received at least one item, we can allocate item 3 to any agent. Let's assign it to the agent with the next highest valuation of item 3. Based on the next highest valuation for item 3, we select Agent 0 as they highly value item 3.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [7]
}
```
