Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  59  20  25  64   6  53  99
1  22  91  27  70  10  95   0   0
2  23  48  70   0  23  50  92  72
3  41  99  43  50  13  83  83  42
4  10  33  34  79  29  72  55  75
5  15  11  30   4  55   0  87  25
6  55  10  25  84  95  31  79  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a number of items proportional to their valuations, considering that each agent should get at least one item and no agent should get more items than is fair. We will consider the sum of valuations for each agent and make allocations accordingly:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all the items.
2. Distribute the 8 items in the way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring fair distribution.

Let's calculate the total valuations:

- Agent 0: 52 + 59 + 20 + 25 + 64 + 6 + 53 + 99 = 378
- Agent 1: 22 + 91 + 27 + 70 + 10 + 95 + 0 + 0 = 315
- Agent 2: 23 + 48 + 70 + 0 + 23 + 50 + 92 + 72 = 378
- Agent 3: 41 + 99 + 43 + 50 + 13 + 83 + 83 + 42 = 454
- Agent 4: 10 + 33 + 34 + 79 + 29 + 72 + 55 + 75 = 387
- Agent 5: 15 + 11 + 30 + 4 + 55 + 0 + 87 + 25 = 227
- Agent 6: 55 + 10 + 25 + 84 + 95 + 31 + 79 + 83 = 462

Now, distribute the items to maximize the total value for each agent:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [],
    "6": [6]
}
```

Explanation of allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 5, which are among the items they value highly.
- Agent 1 gets item 1, which is the highest valued item for them.
- Agent 2 gets item 2, which is highly valued by them.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets items 4 and 7, ensuring they have a fair share.
- Agent 5 does not receive any items due to their lower total valuation.
- Agent 6 gets item 6, which is one of the items they value highly.

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed and tries to reflect the preferences of the agents based on their valuations.
