Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  54   2   7  65  64  89  71
1  77  24  88  44  12  10  33  15
2  56  65  61  54  50  40  61  73
3  27  54   7  79  65  47  99  82
4   1  19  30  32  32  37  71  21
5  92  82  52  78  22  10  80  15
6  35  86  76  68  83  33  49  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Begin by identifying the highest value each agent assigns to any item.
2. Allocate that item to the respective agent if the item hasn't been allocated yet.
3. Continue this process while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
4. Adjust if necessary to ensure all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation satisfying the conditions:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 89.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 88.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the highest at 73.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest at 99, but since it's already allocated, we allocate item 3 at 79.
- Agent 4 values item 6 the highest at 71, but since it's already allocated, we allocate item 5 at 37.
- Agent 5 values item 0 the highest at 92.
- Agent 6 values item 1 the highest at 86.

After these allocations, we have:

- Item 4 remains unallocated. It has a relatively high value for agent 6 compared to the other agents.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated, with attempts made to maximize agents' satisfaction based on their valuations.
