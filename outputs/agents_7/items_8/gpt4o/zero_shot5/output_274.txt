Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  98   6  56  25  57  57  22
1  90  20  34  92   4   3  28  38
2  28  87  73  78  79  55  37  55
3  13  58  79  11  84  44  67  19
4  10  30   2  78  12  23  94  93
5  37  22  43  73  93  10  70  41
6  61  82  52  43  86  77  56  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we want to ensure that each agent has a fair share of items based on their valuations. We'll aim to distribute the items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to get a sense of their relative preferences.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent that values them the most, keeping track of how many items each agent has received to ensure fairness.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Agent 0: Total valuation = 379
- Agent 1: Total valuation = 309
- Agent 2: Total valuation = 492
- Agent 3: Total valuation = 375
- Agent 4: Total valuation = 342
- Agent 5: Total valuation = 389
- Agent 6: Total valuation = 495

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 90. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 98. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 79. Allocate to Agent 3.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 92. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 5 values it the most at 93. Allocate to Agent 5.
6. Item 5: Agent 6 values it the most at 77. Allocate to Agent 6.
7. Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most at 94. Allocate to Agent 4.
8. Item 7: Agent 4 values it the most at 93. Allocate to Agent 4.

Now, we'll present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6, 7],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
