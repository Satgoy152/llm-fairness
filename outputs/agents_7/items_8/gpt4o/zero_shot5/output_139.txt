Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  41  27  25  97  63  93   7
1   3  28  17  35  97  40  52   8
2  77  11  35  56  37  68  70  85
3  99  23  22  99  67  97  20  27
4  97  53  80  68  14  83  29  15
5  24  16  16  90  13  11  15  80
6  26  26  10  42  15  21  81  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given the table, we should try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring fairness.

### Allocation Process:
1. **Identify the Highest Valuation Per Agent:** We start by allocating the item with the highest value for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. **Remaining Items Allocation:** Once each agent has at least one item, we will allocate the remaining items to the agents who value them the most, without repetition.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Highest value is 97 for item 4.
- **Agent 1:** Highest value is 97 for item 4, but it's already taken by Agent 0; next highest is 40 for item 5.
- **Agent 2:** Highest value is 85 for item 7.
- **Agent 3:** Highest value is 99 for item 0.
- **Agent 4:** Highest value is 97 for item 0, but it's already taken by Agent 3; next highest is 80 for item 2.
- **Agent 5:** Highest value is 90 for item 3.
- **Agent 6:** Highest value is 81 for item 6.

### Remaining Items:
- Items 1 and 4 are left.
- **Item 1:** Highest remaining valuations are Agent 4 (53) and Agent 0 (41). Allocate to Agent 4.
- **Item 4:** Highest remaining valuations are Agent 1 (97) and Agent 2 (37). Allocate to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 1],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and that the total number of items allocated is 8.
