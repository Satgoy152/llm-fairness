Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  81  69  53  57  72  67  26
1  27  12  35  66  20  15  10  31
2  67  55  98  22  93  23   5  39
3   2  23  82  35  43  20  48  13
4  70  71  18  74  61  32  65  81
5   9   8  36  11  69  58  65  49
6  36  21   2  68  50  37   9   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [36 21  2 68 50 37  9  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences while also ensuring all 8 items are allocated.

One way to approach this problem is to use a round-robin allocation method where each agent picks their most valued remaining item in turns. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Gets item 1 (value 81)
2. **Agent 1**: Gets item 3 (value 66)
3. **Agent 2**: Gets item 2 (value 98)
4. **Agent 3**: Gets item 6 (value 48)
5. **Agent 4**: Gets item 7 (value 81)
6. **Agent 5**: Gets item 4 (value 69)
7. **Agent 6**: Gets item 5 (value 37)
8. **Agent 0**: Gets item 0 (value 45)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets a reasonably fair allocation based on their values.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [5]
}
```
