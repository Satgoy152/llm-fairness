Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  25  73  71  43   3  34  18
1  39   0  29  57  17  53  85   8
2  27   8  61  41  42  68  42  97
3  47  37   2  17  63  69  76  58
4  27  67  20  80  80  65  31  90
5  91  39   2  75  69  19  89  53
6  65  38  34  76  55   7  31  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [65 38 34 76 55  7 31 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items while maximizing the total valuation. A simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation per item and ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's an allocation strategy:

1. For each item, find the agent who values it the most.
2. Assign that item to the respective agent.
3. Ensure that all items are distributed.

Let's allocate the items based on this strategy:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 5 (91)
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (67)
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (73)
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (80)
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (80)
- Item 5: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (69)
- Item 6: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (85)
- Item 7: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (97)

Following this strategy, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 3, 4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": []
}
```
