Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  53  19  92  32  13  41  64
1  27  87   5  83  62  68  48   7
2   7  27  77  63  86   0  63  47
3  22  98  86  59  24   6  88  23
4  31  75  91  42  16  54  90  61
5  48  99  25  18  86  96   7  70
6  80  54  50  86  95  36  83   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute all 8 items among the 7 agents in a way that is as balanced as possible according to their valuations.

We'll proceed with the allocation based on the highest value each agent places on different items. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is 3 (value 92).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 1 (value 87).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 4 (value 86).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 1 (value 98) but it's already taken, so we choose item 6 (value 88).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item is 2 (value 91).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value item is 1 (value 99), but it's already taken, so we choose item 5 (value 96).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value item is 4 (value 95), but it's already taken, so we choose item 3 (value 86).

At this point, we have allocated these items: 3, 1, 4, 6, 2, 5, 3. We need to allocate one more item.

8. **Agent 0**: Remaining high-value item is 0 (value 54).

Now each agent has at least one item, and all items have been allocated. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": []
}
```

Note: It's important to reassess if any changes in agent assignments might lead to more balanced allocations or higher total valuations, but within the constraints provided, this distribution aims to maximize fairness and value for each agent.
