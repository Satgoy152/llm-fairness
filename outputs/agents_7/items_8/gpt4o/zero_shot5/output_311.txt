Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  73  60  12  43  21  84  70
1  61  73  92  90  26   9  80  33
2  98  10  90  94  80  89  82  65
3  96  87   7  81   2  37  66  35
4  25  12  13  31  15  42  13  70
5  89  50  88  48  91  46  13  11
6  36  21  60  33  26  59  34  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that the distribution of items is as balanced as possible. Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, at least one agent will receive an additional item.

Let's consider an approach where each agent tries to get the item with the highest available value for them, while keeping in mind the need to distribute the items fairly across all agents. 

Here is one possible allocation that attempts to fairly distribute the items:

1. Agent 2 receives item 0 because it has the highest valuation (98) for it.
2. Agent 1 receives item 2 because it has a high valuation (92) for it.
3. Agent 3 receives item 1 because it has a high valuation (87) for it.
4. Agent 0 receives item 6 because it has a high valuation (84) for it.
5. Agent 6 receives item 7 because it has a high valuation (83) for it.
6. Agent 5 receives item 4 because it has a high valuation (91) for it.
7. Agent 4 receives items 3 and 5, as they have relatively low valuations across the board, but it helps balance the distribution of items. 

Below is the allocation summarized in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 5],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
