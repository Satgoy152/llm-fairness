Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  63  53  26  24  60  90  38
1  72  82  54  75  45  66  46  96
2  37   4   2   6  46  39  12  65
3  36  12  80  17  21  41  51   3
4  77  55  40  39  62  44  65   8
5   8  56   7  92  82  41  49  66
6  68  53  58  55  88  54  19  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. To begin, let's consider the highest value each agent assigns to an item and allocate based on those values.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (92), Item 6 (90)
   - Allocate: Items 0 and 6

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 7 (96)
   - Allocate: Item 7

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 7 (65) is already allocated, next highest is Item 4 (46)
   - Allocate: Item 4

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (80)
   - Allocate: Item 2

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (77) is already allocated, next highest is Item 6 (65) is already allocated, next is Item 4 (62) is already allocated, next is Item 1 (55)
   - Allocate: Item 1

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (92)
   - Allocate: Item 3

7. **Agent 6**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (88) is already allocated, next highest is Item 2 (58) is already allocated, next is Item 0 (68) is already allocated, next is Item 6 (54) is already allocated, next is Item 5 (54)
   - Allocate: Item 5

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [5]
}
```
