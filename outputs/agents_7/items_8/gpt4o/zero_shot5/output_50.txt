Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  14  36   1  64  77  65   5
1  26  32  83  29  63  95  15   3
2  92  66  74  13  56  21  84  59
3  66  46   9  67  97  39  28  66
4  68  49  28   9  53  85  70   8
5  11  64  80   5  79  74  21  34
6  44   7  21  38  22   1  13  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the allocation respects the preferences (or valuations) as much as possible. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 5 (77).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 5, but assigned item 2 (83) as item 5 is already taken.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 0 (92).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 4 (97).
5. **Agent 4**: Second highest valuation for item 5 (85), as item 4 is taken.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation for item 4, but assigned item 2 is taken so they get item 1 (64).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation for item 7 (54).

Here's the allocation considering these preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [7]
}
```

Note: Since each agent should get an integer number of items and there are more agents than items, not every agent will receive an item. This allocation attempts to maximize the individual preferences of each agent based on the given valuations.
