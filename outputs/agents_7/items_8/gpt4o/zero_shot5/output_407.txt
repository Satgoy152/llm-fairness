Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47   8  84  29  50   1  90  34
1  61  15  69  49  35  17  44  31
2  69  47   0  97  49  72  47  87
3  37  76  74  30  40  66  61  44
4   6  92  63  19   6  31  82  77
5  41  89   7  70  66  10  49  62
6  58  86  49  12   9   0  17  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value received by each agent. A common approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuation until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Assign items to agents based on highest valuation:**
   - Look at the valuations for each item and assign the item to the agent who values it the most.
   - If a tie occurs (multiple agents value the item equally), select one agent arbitrarily or consider balancing the total number of items each agent gets.

2. **Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items:**
   - Re-distribute items if any agent receives no items or if the distribution is not balanced (i.e., some agents receive significantly more items than others).

3. **Finalize the allocation:**
   - Ensure exactly 8 items are allocated in total.

Following this process, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (value 69)
- Item 1: Agent 4 (value 92)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (value 84)
- Item 3: Agent 2 (value 97)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (value 50)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (value 72)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (value 90)
- Item 7: Agent 2 (value 87)

This allocation gives Agent 0 three items and Agent 2 four items, while Agent 4 gets one item. To balance the distribution slightly, we can adjust the allocation between Agents 0 and 2.

A fairer allocation might look like this:

- Item 0: Agent 2
- Item 1: Agent 4
- Item 2: Agent 0
- Item 3: Agent 2
- Item 4: Agent 1
- Item 5: Agent 2
- Item 6: Agent 0
- Item 7: Agent 3

This allocation ensures:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 6.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 3, and 5.
- Agent 3 receives item 7.
- Agent 4 receives item 1.
- Agents 5 and 6 receive no items.

The final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3, 5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```
