Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  52  47  72  72  96  59  42
1  36  70  27  92  36  78  17   0
2  71  62  14  33  54  50  48  48
3  64  62  55  60  56  93  90  80
4  49  57  33  18  70  83  25  27
5  68  83   9  54  95  35  94  31
6  71   4  85  91  56  35  53  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. We will aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 5.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most.
3. Agent 2 has moderate valuations across several items, with the highest for item 0.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most, followed by item 6.
5. Agent 4 values items 4 and 5 highly.
6. Agent 5 values item 4 the most.
7. Agent 6 values item 2 the most.

To maximize overall satisfaction, we'll assign items based on the highest valuations, trying to ensure each agent gets at least one high-valued item if possible. We also try to ensure that the allocations are balanced, such that no single agent takes all the high-value items.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: [3] (value: 72)
- Agent 1: [1] (value: 70)
- Agent 2: [0] (value: 71)
- Agent 3: [5] (value: 93)
- Agent 4: [4] (value: 70)
- Agent 5: [6] (value: 94)
- Agent 6: [2, 7] (value: 85, 60)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a valuable item according to their preferences, and all 8 items are allocated.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2, 7]
}
```
