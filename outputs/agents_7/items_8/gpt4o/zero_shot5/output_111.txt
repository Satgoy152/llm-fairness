Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  27  60  74  82   7  32  51
1  57  38  11   1  16  53  39  93
2  73  20  53  21  44  78  63  45
3  35  81  50  29  98  19  66  82
4  94  63  93  20  94  75  10  67
5  29  26  61   3  64   0  45  45
6   9  23  58  99  36  38   0  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. This means trying to assign items to agents such that the sum of the values of the items they receive is as high as possible for each agent. 

Given that there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each. Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0, so assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4, so assign item 4 to agent 3.
3. Agent 6 has a very high valuation for item 3, so assign item 3 to agent 6.
4. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 7, so assign item 7 to agent 1.
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 2, so assign item 2 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 has a relatively high valuation for item 5, so assign item 5 to agent 5.
7. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 6, so assign item 6 to agent 2.
8. Agent 3 also has a high valuation for item 1, and since they received only 1 item so far, assign item 1 to agent 3.

Based on this allocation strategy, the JSON representation of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This distribution attempts to fairly allocate items to maximize the preferences of the agents based on their valuations.
