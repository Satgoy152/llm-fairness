Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  22  17  84  92  70  87  39
1  85  90  19  47  95  21  31  83
2  50   5  53  13  63  66  30  72
3  52  13  77  42  81  72  94  61
4   6  38  69  12  94  65  19  55
5  22  25  74  78  61  53  52  81
6  94  29  26  22  59  78  72  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll approach this by looking at the highest values each agent assigns to the items and attempt to allocate based on that.

Following the valuation table, we can make the following allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 4 highly (92), so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (90), so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (66), so we allocate item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the most (94), so we allocate item 6 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 highly, but it's already allocated to agent 0. The next highest is item 5 (65), but it's also allocated. The next highest available is item 7 (55), so we allocate item 7 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most (78), so we allocate item 3 to agent 5.
- Agent 6 values item 0 the most (94), so we allocate item 0 to agent 6.

Now, the remaining unallocated items are 2. We need to distribute this remaining item to ensure that all items are allocated.

- Assign item 2 to agent 4 (the next highest value for item 2 is 69).

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7, 2],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [0]
}
```
