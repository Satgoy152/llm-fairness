Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  50  60  24  12  25  57  65
1  59  89  56  36  57  24  70  69
2  26  36  55  46  30  11  15  62
3   8   8  17  82  54  46  73  17
4  65  79  16  34  28  25  91  97
5  13  35  62   2  71  34  65  42
6  78  28  54  55  94  21   9  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. One common approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. However, since we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of items is exactly 8, we need to consider the distribution carefully.

Let's evaluate the highest value each agent assigns to items and allocate accordingly while ensuring fairness.

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 7 the highest at 65.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the highest at 89.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 7 the highest at 62, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 2 at 55.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the highest at 82.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 7 the highest at 97.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 4 the highest at 71.
7. **Agent 6**: Values item 4 the highest at 94, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 0 at 78.

Now, let's adjust the allocation to ensure all items are distributed and no agent is left out:

- **Agent 0**: Items [7]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1]
- **Agent 2**: Items [2]
- **Agent 3**: Items [3]
- **Agent 4**: Items [6] (as item 7 is already allocated, next highest is item 6)
- **Agent 5**: Items [4]
- **Agent 6**: Items [0, 5] (item 4 was taken, so next highest are 0 and 5)

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

The final allocations in the specified JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [0, 5]
}
```
