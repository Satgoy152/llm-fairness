Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  43  58  95  97  85  55   9
1  39   4  13  87  47  81  90  67
2  52  85   4  54  78  58  70  51
3  11  35  81  63  20  45  92  99
4  93  86  53  47  44  71  40  35
5  55  40  64   9  35   9  31  98
6  50  21  41  64  34  46   5  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation is reasonably maximized while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's one approach to achieve that:

1. **Assign items based on highest valuations**: Start by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. This ensures that each item is initially given to the agent who values it the highest.

2. **Balance allocations**: After the initial assignment, check if any agent has more than one item while others have none. If this occurs, try to reassign items such that each agent has at least one item, or ensure that the distribution is as fair as possible.

Following this method, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2, as they have relatively high valuations for these items.
- Agent 1 gets item 6, which they value highly.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 5.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.
- Agent 5 gets item 7.
- Agent 6 gets item 3.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This allocation respects the rule of fairly distributing the 8 items among the 7 agents, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed based on relative valuations.
