Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  59  91  20   9  97  52  27
1   3  38  11  51  46  62   3  81
2  41  53  47  27  62  13  76  95
3  40  57  81   2  74  50  77   2
4  65  81  35  91  31  99  79  67
5  53  37  52  64  16  55  28  72
6  15  23  27  15  17  17  33  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we aim to distribute the 8 items in a manner where the total value each agent receives is maximized while ensuring every agent gets an integer number of items.

We have 8 items and 7 agents, which means that one agent can get 2 items while others will get 1 or zero. After analyzing the valuation table, the following allocation ensures a fair distribution:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations on items 2 and 5.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation on item 7.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation on item 7, but since it's already taken, item 6 is the next best.
4. Agent 3 prefers item 4.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation on item 5, but that's already taken, so item 3 is next.
6. Agent 5 prefers item 7, but that's taken, so item 0 is the best.
7. Agent 6 has low valuations overall, so can take the least preferred item 1.

Considering these preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [1]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives item 7.
- Agent 2 receives item 6.
- Agent 3 receives item 4.
- Agent 4 receives item 3.
- Agent 5 receives item 0.
- Agent 6 receives item 1.

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
