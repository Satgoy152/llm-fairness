Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  89   3  54  75  40   0  60
1  36  59  57  10  86  66  64  64
2  61  14  61  24  46  86  64   3
3  45  50  34  77  92  62   0  65
4  31  71  49  26  29  39   5  12
5  68   5   6  98  13  65  60  12
6  41  82  46  73  62  58   4  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method such as the "maximum sum allocation" method, where each agent gets items that maximize their total value while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given that we need to allocate exactly 8 items among 7 agents, one agent will receive two items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0 and 1, but since we need to ensure each agent gets something, let's start by giving item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest value for item 4. Assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest value for item 5. Assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest value for item 3. Assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Has the highest value for item 1 (after agent 0), but we need to ensure other agents get items too. Assign item 6 to agent 4 since it has low value for others.
6. **Agent 5**: Has the highest value for item 3, but it's already taken. Assign item 7 to agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: Has the highest value for item 1 among the remaining items. Assign item 1 to agent 6.

At this point, all agents have one item, but we still have one more item (item 2) to allocate. Let's give it to the agent who values it the highest among those who have less total value so far.

8. **Assign item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the highest among those with just one item and lower total value. Assign item 2 to agent 0.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [1]
}
```
