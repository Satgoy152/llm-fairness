Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  81  85  31  33  83  46  87
1  17   0  94  88  99   5  72  37
2  49  59  20  90  46  45  10   0
3  37  21  41  76  60  52  62  28
4  18  79   9  99  42  94  69  10
5  48  27  30  86  68  98  16  74
6  50  80  10  74  19  74   2  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations while ensuring that all 8 items are distributed. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Identify the highest value each agent has for any item.
2. Assign items starting with the highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 7 with a value of 87.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4 with a value of 99.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 with a value of 90.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3 with a value of 76 (but item 3 is already allocated, next is item 6 with a value of 62).
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 3 with a value of 99 (but item 3 is already allocated, next is item 5 with a value of 94).
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 5 with a value of 98 (but item 5 is already allocated, next highest is item 3 with a value of 86, but it is already allocated, next is item 7 with a value of 74).
- Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 1 with a value of 80.

Now, we need to ensure all 8 items are allocated. Currently, items 0, 2, and 4 are unallocated. Let's assign those:

- Agent 0 will take item 0 since they value it at 73.
- Agent 1 will take item 2 since they value it at 94 (highest available unallocated value).
- Agent 6 will take item 4 since they value it at 19 (next highest available unallocated value).

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that are valuable to them while all items are fairly distributed.
