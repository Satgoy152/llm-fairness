Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  32  88   6  12  55   0  72
1  69  14  72  72  15  34  64  53
2  26   2  72  81  47  72  27  91
3  34  15  52  45  75  67  71  10
4  78   2   7  28  35  45  63  51
5  84   5  44  61  88  11  89  26
6  44  85  96  87   6  99  66   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we can use a simple method that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their highest valuations. Since each agent should receive at least one item (except one agent, because there are more agents than items), we will ensure that every agent other than one receives at least one item. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 2 (Value: 88)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 0 (Value: 69)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 7 (Value: 91)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 6 (Value: 71)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 3 (Value: 28)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 4 (Value: 88)
7. **Agent 6**: Item 5 (Value: 99)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item that they value highly, except for Agent 4, who receives a less valuable item due to the constraints of total items available.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [5]
}
```
