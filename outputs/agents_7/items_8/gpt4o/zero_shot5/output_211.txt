Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  24  69  91  55   4  94  71
1  68  87  82  57  58  96  20  71
2  14  40  19  18  84   3  65  65
3  61   4   0  65  11  17  65  23
4  71  64   9  71   9  83  64  83
5  28  18   9   8  53  60  54  81
6  81  87  46  85  75  28  73  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible and that all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item**: We assign each item to the agent who values it the most, breaking ties arbitrarily if necessary.

2. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item**: If any agent ends up with no items, we reassign items to ensure that all agents receive at least one, while keeping the overall allocation as fair as possible.

Based on the table provided, let's determine the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 6 values it the most (81).
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most (87).
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most (82).
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (91).
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most (84).
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most (96).
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most (94).
- **Item 7**: Agent 6 values it the most (96).

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [4]
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: No items
- Agent 6: Items [0, 7]

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0, 7]
}
```
