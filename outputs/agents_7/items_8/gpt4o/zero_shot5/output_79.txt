Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  15  26  72  99  70  69  21
1  78  96  50  64   2  79  10   2
2  80  17  90  31  15  94  40  19
3  81  40  58  14   1  89  35  14
4  24  24  57  81  66  24  55  85
5  31  59  74   5  83  35   3  90
6  61  46  93  93  50  21  48   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value based on their valuations, and that all 8 items are distributed. Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: Determine the total value each agent assigns to all items.
   
2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation**: Start by allocating items to each agent based on their highest valuation for an item that hasn't yet been allocated.

3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Continue the allocation process until all items are distributed.

4. **Check for Fairness**: Ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible, considering the constraints of the problem.

Here's one way to allocate the items to the agents:

- **Agent 0**: Item 4 (highest value 99)
- **Agent 1**: Item 1 (highest value 96)
- **Agent 2**: Item 5 (highest value 94)
- **Agent 3**: Item 0 (highest value 81)
- **Agent 4**: Item 7 (highest value 85)
- **Agent 5**: Item 6 (highest value 90)
- **Agent 6**: Item 2 (highest value 93) and Item 3 (highest value 93)

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, with the exception of agent 6 who gets two items due to their high valuations, and all 8 items are allocated as required.
