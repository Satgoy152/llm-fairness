Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  87  97  77  67   0  10   1
1  59   6  93  63  44  35  74  50
2  74  76  45  81  42  45  82  52
3  80   6  73  32  56  99  49  16
4  70  98  97  55  49  68  31  33
5  90  61  23  75  20  87   1  59
6   8  93  49  41   4  41  51  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we should aim to maximize overall satisfaction or value based on the provided valuations. Here is one possible allocation strategy that attempts to balance the values each agent receives:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 93).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 6 (value 93).
3. Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value 99).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 67).
5. Assign item 0 to agent 5 (value 90).
6. Assign item 3 to agent 2 (value 81).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value 82).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 4 (value 33).

This allocation method tries to ensure that each item goes to an agent who values it highly, while also attempting to ensure that each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 8 items to the agents, maximizing their individual valuations for the items received.
