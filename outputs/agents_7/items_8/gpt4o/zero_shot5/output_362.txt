Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  60   8  46  68  29  47  42
1  76  65  53  69  68  38  59   9
2  55  96  93  72  73  59  91   0
3  89   7  28  85  79  67  90  43
4  27  67   5  12  56  96  12  79
5  26  21  14  43  16  46  63  82
6   0  86  55  47  63  12  82  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are distributed. The goal is to allocate items in such a way that maximizes overall satisfaction, taking into account the agents' valuations for each item.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations based on maximizing the total value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has relatively high valuations for items 1 (60) and 4 (68).
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 (76) the highest.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuations for items 1 (96) and 2 (93).
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 3 (85) the highest.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 5 (96) the highest.
6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 7 (82) the highest.
7. **Agent 6**: This agent values items 6 (82) and 7 (86) highly.

Based on these observations, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: [4]
- **Agent 1**: [0]
- **Agent 2**: [2]
- **Agent 3**: [3]
- **Agent 4**: [5]
- **Agent 5**: [7]
- **Agent 6**: [1, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and their highest or near-highest valued items are prioritized.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [1, 6]
}
```
