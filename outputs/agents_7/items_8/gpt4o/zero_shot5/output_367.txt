Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  77  32   3  47   8  12  80
1  34  47   3  35  43  51  86  69
2  15  16   7  52  92  28  89  48
3  60  61  24  11  25  30  55  51
4  27  85  91  64  26  66  95  58
5  55  51   5  35  59  96  49  48
6  18  64  95  50  20  84  56  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given that there are 8 items and 7 agents, one of the agents will likely receive 2 items. 

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign items to agents based on maximizing their individual valuations.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.
3. If needed, adjust allocations to ensure all items are distributed.

Let's go through the items and allocate them:

- **Item 0:** Agent 3 values it the most (60).
- **Item 1:** Agent 4 values it the most (85).
- **Item 2:** Agent 6 values it the most (95).
- **Item 3:** Agent 2 values it the most (52).
- **Item 4:** Agent 2 values it the most (92).
- **Item 5:** Agent 5 values it the most (96).
- **Item 6:** Agent 1 values it the most (86).
- **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it the most (80).

Adjusting to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and considering the requirement that only and at least 8 items are distributed, we have:

- Agent 0: Item 7
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Item 5
- Agent 6: Item 2

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2]
}
```
