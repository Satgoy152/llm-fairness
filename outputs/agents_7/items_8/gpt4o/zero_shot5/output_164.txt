Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  99  32  90  61  69  17  74
1  56  25  39  76  34  74  22  15
2  64  81  32  48   6  78  19  69
3  15  46  19   4  82  39  36  71
4  96  27  47  90  11  26  16  44
5  46  63  34  57  73  18  40   3
6  79  67  23  73  20  15  61  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and that all items are distributed. One approach is to distribute the items such that each agent's valuation is considered, aiming to maximize fairness by considering each agent's preferences. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest, with a value of 99.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest, with a value of 74.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the second highest, with a value of 81 (item 1 already allocated, so we consider the next highest available).
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest, with a value of 82.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the highest, with a value of 96.
6. Agent 5 values item 4 the second highest, with a value of 73 (item 4 already allocated, so we consider the next highest available).
7. Agent 6 values item 6 the highest, with a value of 61.

After considering the above preferences, we need to ensure all items are allocated. Let's complete the allocation:

- Item 2 is assigned to Agent 2, based on their next highest preference.
- Item 3 is assigned to Agent 0, based on their next highest preference.
- Item 7 is assigned to Agent 6, based on their next highest preference.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [],
    "6": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, taking into account their preferences as much as possible.
