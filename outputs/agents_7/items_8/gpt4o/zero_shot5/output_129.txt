Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  59   9  45  69   5  90  25
1  29  25  54  83   6  17  14  37
2  75  94  16  16  40  12  47  30
3  72  17  89  58  13  54  66  61
4  55  37  86  49  96  37  16  36
5  33  25  14  48  56   3   5  39
6  41  78  38  11   4   1   9  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. Given the valuations, a fair allocation would aim to maximize the total satisfaction or utility across all agents. 

One possible approach is to allocate items to agents who value them the most. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value 90).
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 83).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value 94).
4. Assign item 2 to agent 3 (value 89).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 4 (value 96).
6. Assign item 7 to agent 6 (value 72).
7. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value 75).
8. Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value 54).

This allocation considers maximizing the value each agent gets from their allocated items.

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [],
    "6": [7]
}
```
