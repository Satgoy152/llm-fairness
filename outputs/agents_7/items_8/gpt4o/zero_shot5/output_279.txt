Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  34  72  60  29   5  20  12
1  54  48  88  31  68  37  50  22
2  18  17  92  82  85  63  66  59
3  20  56  76  77  56  92  37  43
4  40   9  27  97  37  87  82  84
5  62  63  50  49  28  58  30  78
6  68  48  64  37  61  30  97  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to do it:

1. Find the highest valuation for each item and allocate that item to the corresponding agent.
2. If there are still items left to be allocated or if some agents have no items, balance the allocations by reassigning or assigning items to ensure fairness.

Following this approach, we can derive the allocations:

1. Item 0 has the highest valuation of 68 from agent 6.
2. Item 1 has the highest valuation of 63 from agent 5.
3. Item 2 has the highest valuation of 92 from agent 2.
4. Item 3 has the highest valuation of 97 from agent 4.
5. Item 4 has the highest valuation of 85 from agent 2.
6. Item 5 has the highest valuation of 92 from agent 3.
7. Item 6 has the highest valuation of 97 from agent 6.
8. Item 7 has the highest valuation of 84 from agent 4.

Balancing the allocation to ensure each agent is considered, and each agent gets at least one item where possible, results in:

- Agent 0: no items
- Agent 1: item 7
- Agent 2: items 2, 4
- Agent 3: item 5
- Agent 4: item 3
- Agent 5: item 1
- Agent 6: items 0, 6

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [0, 6]
}
```
