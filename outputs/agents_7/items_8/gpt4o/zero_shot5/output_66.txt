Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  78  64  44  88  89  69  21
1  19  21  35  45  13  62  83   6
2  80  74  55  93  15  13  29   8
3  76  76  35  56  31  32  13  32
4  66  74  27  61  85  13   0  47
5  48  58  33  78  87  28   4   9
6  89  91  76  72  68  41  54  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [89 91 76 72 68 41 54 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one potential way to allocate the items:

1. Each agent should ideally receive at least one item.
2. Allocate items based on the highest valuation for each agent, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

- Agent 0: Highest valuation is for item 5 (89).
- Agent 1: Highest valuation is for item 6 (83).
- Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 3 (93).
- Agent 3: Highest valuation is for item 0 (76).
- Agent 4: Highest valuation is for item 4 (85).
- Agent 5: Highest valuation is for item 4, but it's taken. Next is item 3, but it's taken. Next is item 1 (58).
- Agent 6: Highest valuation is for item 1, but it's taken. Next is item 0, but it's taken. Next is item 2 (76).

Now, let's check the allocations and adjust if necessary to ensure all items are assigned:

- Items assigned: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Only item 7 is left unassigned.
- Agent 3 has only one item (0) with a lower valuation compared to item 7. Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [2]
}
```
