Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  26  27  98  25  24  78  54
1  43   6  60  49  56  61  81  98
2  99   5   2  24  39  61  84   2
3  36  23  72  80   7  22  28  99
4  24   1  16  29   9  85  99  41
5  31  64  66  10  70  90  51  38
6  87  33  36   0  36  83  56  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 26 27 98 25 24 78 54]
 [43  6 60 49 56 61 81 98]
 [99  5  2 24 39 61 84  2]
 [36 23 72 80  7 22 28 99]

 [31 64 66 10 70 90 51 38]
 [87 33 36  0 36 83 56 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation based on the given valuations, considering each agent's highest preference:

1. **Agent 0:** Has the highest valuation for item 3 (98). 
2. **Agent 1:** Has the highest valuation for item 7 (98), but since item 7 is the highest for another agent as well, we look for alternatives. 
3. **Agent 2:** Has the highest valuation for item 0 (99).
4. **Agent 3:** Has the highest valuation for item 7 (99).
5. **Agent 4:** Has the highest valuation for item 6 (99).
6. **Agent 5:** Has the highest valuation for item 5 (90).
7. **Agent 6:** Has the highest valuation for item 0 (87), but item 0 is already allocated to Agent 2, so we choose an alternative.

Now, let's assign items based on maximizing valuations and ensuring all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 1 (since 6 is not a preferred item for any other agent)
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: Item 6
- Agent 5: Item 5
- Agent 6: Item 4 (since it's one of the remaining items)

This allocation considers each agent's highest available item, ensuring a fair distribution based on the valuations provided.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4]
}
```
