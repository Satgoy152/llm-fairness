Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  84  36   0  78  20  88  13
1  91  96  83  18   9   3  82  57
2   6  81  77  17  62  31  97  78
3  51  60  26  37  51  10  79   8
4  19  20  51  42  11  92  31  75
5   9  59  41  97  49  66  70  11
6  55  35  28  82  15  86  23  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given there are 7 agents and 8 items, most agents will receive one item and one agent will receive two items.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on the highest value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is 88 for item 6.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is 96 for item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is 97 for item 6 (already taken), so the next highest is 81 for item 1 (already taken), then 78 for item 7.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is 79 for item 6 (already taken), so the next highest is 60 for item 1 (already taken), then 51 for item 0.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is 92 for item 5.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value is 97 for item 3.
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value is 86 for item 5 (already taken), so the next highest is 82 for item 3 (already taken), then 55 for item 0 (already taken), and finally 35 for item 1 (already taken), then 28 for item 2.

Now, each agent has been assigned at least one item. We still need to allocate one more item because there are 8 items in total. Let's allocate the remaining item 4 to the agent with the next highest unallocated value:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest unallocated value is 87 for item 0 (already taken), then 84 for item 1 (already taken).
- **Agent 1**: Next highest unallocated value is 83 for item 2.
- **Agent 3**: Next highest unallocated value is 37 for item 3 (already taken).
- **Agent 6**: Next highest unallocated value is 26 for item 4.

Based on this, item 4 will be allocated to **Agent 6**.

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [4]
}
```
