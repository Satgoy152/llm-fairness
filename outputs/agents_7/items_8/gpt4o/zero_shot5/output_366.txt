Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  54  44  48  81  20   8  89
1  23  76  20  54  96  41  78  74
2  27  15  42  84  77  79  82  95
3  63  24  36  89  24  81  78  96
4   6  77  74  13  32   1  96  68
5  56  82  37  42  94   7  28  95
6  96  22  88  68  33  87  67  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [23 76 20 54 96 41 78 74]
 [27 15 42 84 77 79 82 95]

 [56 82 37 42 94  7 28 95]
 [96 22 88 68 33 87 67 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple procedure to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Let's allocate the items such that each agent gets at least one item, and no item is left unallocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign items to agents by selecting the highest-valued item for each agent.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item by re-evaluating and redistributing if necessary.

### Allocation Process:

- Agent 0: The highest value is for item 7 with a value of 89.
- Agent 1: The highest value is for item 4 with a value of 96.
- Agent 2: The highest value is for item 7 with a value of 95.
- Agent 3: The highest value is for item 7 with a value of 96.
- Agent 4: The highest value is for item 6 with a value of 96.
- Agent 5: The highest value is for item 7 with a value of 95.
- Agent 6: The highest value is for item 0 with a value of 96.

### Redistribute to meet constraints:

- Agent 0: Items [7]
- Agent 1: Items [4]
- Agent 2: Items [3]
- Agent 3: Items [5]
- Agent 4: Items [6]
- Agent 5: Items [1]
- Agent 6: Items [0, 2]

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is fair based on the maximum value each agent places on the items.
