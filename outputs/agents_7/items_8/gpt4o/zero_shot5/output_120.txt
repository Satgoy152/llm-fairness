Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  23  93  69   9  26  41  56
1  99  49  88  19  62  96  30  42
2   1   0  29  13  44  33  61  77
3  79  63  31  52  90  52  94  34
4  22  99  61   3  17  63  15  68
5  38  19  61  25  14  20  78  65
6   8  71  19  90   1   8  36  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets the items they value most while considering the overall balance. We need to ensure that all 8 items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation strategy that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the highest valuations:

1. Agent 0: Values item 2 the most with a value of 93.
2. Agent 1: Values item 0 the most with a value of 99.
3. Agent 2: Values item 7 the most with a value of 77.
4. Agent 3: Values item 6 the most with a value of 94.
5. Agent 4: Values item 1 the most with a value of 99.
6. Agent 5: Values item 6 the most, but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 7, but it's also taken. We'll consider item 2 with a value of 61.
7. Agent 6: Values item 3 the most with a value of 90.

After assigning these, the remaining items are 3, 4, and 5. We need to ensure all items are assigned:

- Item 3: Assign to Agent 6 (next highest value).
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 1 (next highest value not considered yet).
- Item 5: Assign to Agent 1 (next highest value not considered yet).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are fairly distributed among the agents according to their preferences while maximizing overall satisfaction.
