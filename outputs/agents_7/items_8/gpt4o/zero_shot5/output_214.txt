Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  15  63  79   9  85  68  58
1  22  44  77  64  92  63  55  47
2  93  75  43  43   1  38  11  79
3   0  53  63  29  60   1  43  64
4  96  80  85  33  97  39  83  70
5  28  26   2  31   1  34  19  36
6   5  79  80  94  35  51  80  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value agents get from their assigned items while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and no agent gets a disproportionate share.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (85). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (92). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (93). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (53). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 0 (96), but it's also taken. Assign item 2 (85) to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 doesn't have high values, but item 3 (31) is available. Assign item 3 to Agent 5.
7. Agent 6 values item 3 the highest, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 6 (80). Assign item 6 to Agent 6.
8. The remaining unassigned item is item 7. Assign it to Agent 4, who values it decently (70).

Here is the allocation in the required json format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 7],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [6]
}
```
