Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  51   1  14   3  98  48  37
1  24  12  44  22  98  38  78  89
2   5  46  48  93  63  93  62  89
3  93  73  57   4  69  40  94  54
4  30  56  75  47  79  22  54  42
5  61  17  86  60  99  50  69  13
6  20  84   9  45  99  14  78  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [20 84  9 45 99 14 78 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Let's examine the valuations provided:

- Agent 0: [7, 51, 1, 14, 3, 98, 48, 37]
- Agent 1: [24, 12, 44, 22, 98, 38, 78, 89]
- Agent 2: [5, 46, 48, 93, 63, 93, 62, 89]
- Agent 3: [93, 73, 57, 4, 69, 40, 94, 54]
- Agent 4: [30, 56, 75, 47, 79, 22, 54, 42]
- Agent 5: [61, 17, 86, 60, 99, 50, 69, 13]
- Agent 6: [20, 84, 9, 45, 99, 14, 78, 64]

To maximize fairness, we'll try to allocate items based on the highest valuations each agent has for the items, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a suggested allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets item 5 (value 98)
2. Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 98)
3. Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 93)
4. Agent 3 gets item 0 (value 93)
5. Agent 4 gets item 2 (value 75)
6. Agent 5 gets item 6 (value 69)
7. Agent 6 gets item 1 (value 84)
8. Assign the remaining item 7 to Agent 1 (value 89) as the next highest preference.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and tries to respect the agents' valuations as much as possible.
