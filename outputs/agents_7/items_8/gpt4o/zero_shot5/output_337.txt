Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  89  10   8  44  87  27  96
1  98  65  13  89  69  81  58  87
2  24  11  48  13  95  99  15  25
3  13  37  29  76   5  12  73  74
4  31  47  51  25  44  74  57  80
5  19  55  77  76  18  44  58  26
6  46  74  16  99   4  48  29  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [46 74 16 99  4 48 29 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to focus on maximizing the total value each agent receives for the items they are allocated. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent may receive two items while the others get one each, or one might get no items while another gets two. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. Each agent should receive at least one item if possible, prioritizing items they value more.
2. The allocation should maximize the total perceived value for each agent.

Considering the above valuations, we can make the following allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 7 highly (96) and item 1 (89).
- Agent 1 values item 0 most (98).
- Agent 2 values item 5 most (99).
- Agent 3 values item 3 most (76).
- Agent 4 values item 7 highly (80).
- Agent 5 values item 2 most (77).
- Agent 6 values item 3 most (99).

Allocating based on these preferences, we have:

1. Agent 0: Item 1
2. Agent 1: Item 0
3. Agent 2: Item 5
4. Agent 3: Item 3
5. Agent 4: Item 7
6. Agent 5: Item 2
7. Agent 6: Item 6

Now, we have one additional item, item 4, which is not allocated yet. We can assign it to the agent who values it the most among those who haven't received their highest value item yet. In this case, Agent 2 values item 4 (95) highly.

Allocating item 4 to Agent 2:

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [6]
}
```
