Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  89  21  16  69  74  45  31
1  48  48  36  11  82  17  42  31
2  54  20  24  34  64  22  25  49
3  72  11  30  65  61  53  51   2
4  91  63  20  79  93  53  59  25
5  72  54  16  41  49  70  97   2
6   3  98  84  42  28  25  25  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets approximately an equal share of the total value, if possible. Let's calculate the total value for each agent and then attempt to allocate the items based on maximizing the value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if feasible.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefer items with higher values like item 0 (97), item 1 (89).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefer items like item 4 (82), item 2 (36).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefer item 7 (49), item 4 (64).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefer item 3 (65).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefer item 4 (93).
6. **Agent 5**: Prefer item 6 (97).
7. **Agent 6**: Prefer item 1 (98).

Attempting to allocate items based on these preferences while ensuring no item is allocated more than once:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [4]
- Agent 2: Items [7]
- Agent 3: Items [3]
- Agent 4: Items [5]
- Agent 5: Items [6]
- Agent 6: Items [2]

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and all 8 items have been assigned.
