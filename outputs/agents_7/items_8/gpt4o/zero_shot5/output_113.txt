Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  47  57  47  91  95  74  30
1  90  88  40  20  80  34   1  13
2  70  51  67  10  99  19  75  84
3  95  73  10  85  94  70  71  64
4  84  16  44  94  65  29  60   7
5   8  63  70  19  62  47  15  62
6  97  18  29  62  26  60  30  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives at least one item and aims to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll try to allocate items such that the overall valuation is maximized.

Let's proceed step by step:

1. **Identify High-Value Items and Allocate Them:**
   - Assign items to agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

2. **Calculate and Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Distribute the remaining items to maximize the total valuation by assigning them to agents who have not yet received an item.

Here's how the allocation could be done:

- Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value 95, highest for item 5).
- Assign item 0 to agent 6 (value 97, highest for item 0).
- Assign item 4 to agent 2 (value 99, highest for item 4).
- Assign item 3 to agent 4 (value 94, highest for item 3).
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value 88, highest for item 1).
- Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value 71, highest for item 6).
- Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value 84, second-highest for item 7 after item 4).
- Assign item 2 to agent 5 (value 70, highest for item 2).

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution tries to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the valuations provided in the table.
