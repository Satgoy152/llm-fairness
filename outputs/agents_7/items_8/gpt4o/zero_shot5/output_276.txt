Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23   2  68  40  63  72  57  81
1  60  44  62  76  50  92  43  53
2  33  81  31  13  58  49   1  17
3  21  29  54  33  95  55  30  34
4  14  51  96  30  65  58  46  60
5  17   5  28  58  25  91  55   4
6  96   8  67  96  64   9  75  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated among the 7 agents.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If there are conflicts (i.e., an agent is assigned more items than they can receive), adjust to ensure each agent ends up with an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's begin the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 6 values it the most at 96.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 81.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most at 96.
- Item 3: Agent 6 values it the most at 96.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most at 95.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 92.
- Item 6: Agent 6 values it the most at 75.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most at 81.

Now, let's make sure all agents have an integer number of items and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: []
- Agent 6: [0, 3, 6]

This allocation ensures each agent has an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. 

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0, 3, 6]
}
```
