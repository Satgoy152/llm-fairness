Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  60  57  89  29  32   8  74
1  89  80  85  31  59  26  88  81
2  86  94   9   3  56  46  31  89
3  45  34  76  48  94  91  50  45
4  83  87  56  26  47  94  24  21
5  43  35   6  50  50  72   8  52
6  50  41  31  39  52  23  63  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's allocation maximizes the total value they receive. Given that there are 8 items and 7 agents, one possible allocation could involve assigning one item to each agent, with one agent receiving two items. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Identify the highest-value item for each agent:**  
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (value 93)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (value 85)
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (value 94)
   - Agent 3: Item 4 (value 94)
   - Agent 4: Item 5 (value 94)
   - Agent 5: Item 7 (value 52)
   - Agent 6: Item 6 (value 63)

2. **Allocate these items to each agent:**  
   - Agent 0 gets Item 0
   - Agent 1 gets Item 2
   - Agent 2 gets Item 1
   - Agent 3 gets Item 4
   - Agent 4 gets Item 5
   - Agent 5 gets Item 7
   - Agent 6 gets Item 6

3. **Distribute any remaining items to maximize total valuation:**  
Since all items have been distributed, but there is one extra item to assign, we need to choose another item for one agent. Reviewing potential secondary allocations:

- Agent 1 could also receive Item 3, increasing their total value by 31.
  
This results in a fair distribution of items that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are assigned.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their highest valuations.
