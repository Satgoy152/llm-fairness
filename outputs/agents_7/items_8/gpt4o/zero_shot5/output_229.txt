Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  77  49  56  47  80  67   3
1  96  12  44  89   5  62  73  66
2  68  53  77  11  65  55   5  88
3  93  74  28   5  44  46  63  51
4  98  34   0  49  16   4  81  33
5   7  41  80  16   1  92  68   4
6  25  11  63   9  65  69  83  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a greedy approach where each agent is assigned the item they value the most from those that haven't been assigned yet. We should also ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible by balancing the number of items each agent receives.

Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 5 (value 80)
2. Agent 1: Item 0 (value 96)
3. Agent 2: Item 2 (value 77)
4. Agent 3: Item 3 (value 5)
5. Agent 4: Item 6 (value 81)
6. Agent 5: Item 4 (value 1)
7. Agent 6: Item 7 (value 65)

Since Agent 3 has the lowest total value, let's give them an additional item to balance the distribution:

8. Agent 3: Item 1 (value 74)

Now each agent has received items in a manner that seeks to maximize their total valuations and balances the distribution as much as possible. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [7]
}
```
