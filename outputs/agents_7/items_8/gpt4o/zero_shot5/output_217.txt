Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  82  50  77  47  55  26  96
1  43  42   1  58  70  72  53  89
2  10  38  10  21  63  19  39  68
3  45  53  93  64  99  67  32  27
4  55  28  93  42  19   8  89  59
5  13  93   5  41  71  84  97  12
6  21  39   1  64  60  67  68  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple method that considers the highest valuations each agent has for the items, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Start by assigning the items with the highest valuations to each agent.
2. Then, ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and redistribute if necessary.

Allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most (96).
- Agent 1 values item 7 the most, but it's already taken; the next highest is item 5 (72).
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most, but it's already taken; the next highest is item 4 (63).
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most (99).
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most (93).
- Agent 5 values item 6 the most (97).
- Agent 6 values item 6 the most, but it's already taken; the next highest is item 3 (64).

After ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and redistributing other items fairly:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [0]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated one item, and all 8 items have been allocated.
