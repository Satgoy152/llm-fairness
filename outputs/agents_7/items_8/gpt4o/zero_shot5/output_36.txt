Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  57  87  55  70  73  59   1
1  30  25  20  17  80   0   1  31
2  89  75  43  80  57  57  20  61
3  28  66  96  81  13  12  76  60
4  32  64  79  64  92  66  96  34
5  64  22   1  24   6  64  72  75
6   5  36  56  95  44  78  87  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction. One common approach is to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and then allocate the remaining items based on the highest remaining valuations. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Each agent gets one item initially.
2. Distribute the remaining items based on the highest valuations among the remaining items.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (highest valuation among available items for Agent 0)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (highest valuation for Agent 1)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (highest valuation for Agent 2)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (highest valuation for Agent 3)
- Agent 4: Item 6 (highest valuation for Agent 4)
- Agent 5: Item 7 (highest valuation for Agent 5)
- Agent 6: Item 5 (highest valuation for Agent 6)

Now, let's distribute the remaining items:

- Agent 6: Item 1 (next highest available valuation for Agent 6)

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [5, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 8 items distributed among the agents.
