Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  16  41  71   2  85  43  67
1  44   5  94  36  20  51  65  28
2  94  27  22  74   2  88  28  84
3  56  76  55  88  64  92  84  33
4  77  81  44   7  54  63  25  38
5   1   1  78   4  60  64  34  41
6  93  47  76  12  29  50  63  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [93 47 76 12 29 50 63 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents with the highest respective valuations. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. **Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items:** Since there are 7 agents and 8 items, at least one agent will need to receive 2 items.

Let's go through the items and find the highest valuation for each:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (94).
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (81).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (94).
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (88).
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 5 (60).
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (92).
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (84).
- **Item 7**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (84).

From this, we get the following allocations:
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 7
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 3: Items 3, 5, and 6
- Agent 5: Item 4

Note: Agents 0 and 6 do not receive any items.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [3, 5, 6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4],
    "6": []
}
```
