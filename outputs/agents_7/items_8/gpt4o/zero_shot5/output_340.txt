Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  83  36  35  74  31  52  51
1   6  44  12  79  67  36  56  55
2  19   2  43  97  40  23  98  42
3  37  26  47  42  95  94  15  50
4  41  89   0  84  89  63  99  92
5  66  38  52   5  27  75  73  31
6  31  99  72   5  43  43  26  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that considers the values each agent assigns to the items. One approach is to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. We can allocate items where agents have relatively higher valuations compared to others.

Here's one possible allocation based on this strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the most.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 the most.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the most.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 the most, but it's already taken, so item 7 is the next highest.
6. Agent 5 values item 5 the most.
7. Agent 6 values item 1 the most, but it's already taken, so item 7 is the next highest.

Allocating based on maximizing individual agent values while ensuring a fair distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2, 0]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets at least one item. Agent 6, who values item 1 the most, gets item 2 and item 0 instead to complete the allocation of all 8 items, ensuring every item is allocated once.
