Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76   1  10  80  86  44  29  39
1  15   4  91   1  36  80  38  14
2  80  10  55  25  25   9  55  81
3  97  19   2  70  80  95  98  10
4  87  52  55   3  19  15  31  26
5  80  30  61  87  22  16  66   7
6  55  69   8   7   8  98  82  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item.
3. Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure fairness and that all items are allocated.

Let's work through this step-by-step:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most at 97.
- Item 1: Agent 6 values it the most at 69.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
- Item 3: Agent 5 values it the most at 87.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
- Item 5: Agent 6 values it the most at 98.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most at 98.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 81.

Now, let's check the allocation to ensure fairness and that each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Initially has item 4.
- Agent 1: Initially has item 2.
- Agent 2: Initially has item 7.
- Agent 3: Initially has items 0 and 6.
- Agent 4: Initially has no items.
- Agent 5: Initially has item 3.
- Agent 6: Initially has items 1 and 5.

To satisfy the condition that each agent has at least one item, we need to transfer one item to Agent 4. We can transfer item 6 from Agent 3 to Agent 4, as Agent 3 already has item 0.

Now, the allocation would look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated.
