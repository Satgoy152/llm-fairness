Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  20  36  62  53  54  62  42
1  79  13  35  87  97  42  41   0
2  22  36   6  65  28  93   4  42
3  86  56   3  76  98  54   9  87
4   4  96  89  99  73  21  19  87
5  23  79  70  59  97  14  70  66
6  64  30   3   5  74  35  78  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. We want to consider the valuations of each agent to ensure a reasonably fair distribution based on their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 highly (62).
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly (97).
3. Agent 2 values item 5 highly (93).
4. Agent 3 values item 0 highly (86).
5. Agent 4 values item 7 highly (87).
6. Agent 5 values item 2 highly (70).
7. Agent 6 values item 6 highly (78).

This leaves one item unallocated, so we need to find a fair way to allocate the remaining item based on the remaining valuations:

8. The remaining item, item 1, is valued highest by agent 4 (96).

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 7],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [6]
}
```
