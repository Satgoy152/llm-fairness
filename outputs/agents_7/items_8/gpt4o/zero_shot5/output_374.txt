Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  68  90   5  47   6  56  90
1  83  16  10  47  94  45  82  77
2  90  21  87  98  24  76  63  24
3  55   9  46  61   3  15  64  34
4  36  36  13  89  11   4  91  96
5  66  14  35  44  94  84  80  64
6  56  79  13  20  63  56  61  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[41 68 90  5 47  6 56 90]
 [83 16 10 47 94 45 82 77]
 [90 21 87 98 24 76 63 24]
 [55  9 46 61  3 15 64 34]
 [36 36 13 89 11  4 91 96]
 [66 14 35 44 94 84 80 64]
 [56 79 13 20 63 56 61 96]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive two items, and the others will receive one.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 2 gives the highest value of 90.
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 4 gives the highest value of 94.
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 3 gives the highest value of 98.
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 6 gives the highest value of 64.
5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 7 gives the highest value of 96.
6. **Agent 5**:
   - Item 5 gives the highest value of 84.
7. **Agent 6**:
   - Item 1 gives the highest value of 79.
8. Since all agents have received one item, give Agent 0 another item for their second highest value:
   - Item 0 gives a value of 41.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1]
}
```
