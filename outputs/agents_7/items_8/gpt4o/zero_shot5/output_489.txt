Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  48  24  24  60  61  37  33
1  81  76  38  52  74  71  68  48
2  51   2  49  29  89  49  23   8
3  90  66  88  71  71  39  17  38
4  38  64  71  44  42  94  53  13
5  88  77  94  20   7  17  40  37
6  26  68   2  46  60   3  48  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method such as maximizing the total valuation for each agent or using a fair division approach like envy-freeness. Here, I'll attempt to distribute the items to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

First, let's consider the highest valuations for each item across all agents. Then, we'll allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, making sure to keep the allocations as balanced as possible.

1. Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (90)
2. Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (76)
3. Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 5 (94)
4. Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (71)
5. Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (89)
6. Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (94)
7. Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 6 (48)
8. Item 7: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (33)

Let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 7 (33)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (76)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (89)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (90), Item 3 (71)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (94)
- Agent 5: Item 2 (94)
- Agent 6: Item 6 (48)

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
