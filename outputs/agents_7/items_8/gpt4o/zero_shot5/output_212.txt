Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  82  20  83  43  22  73  24
1  74  34  70  28  19  43  22  75
2  55  29  67  60  99  30  61  84
3  89  87  37  45  61  89  86  60
4  57  31  94  71  88  17  87  24
5  80  19  39  46  53  88  20  83
6   6   8  90  47  67  51   9  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction or value each agent receives from their allocated items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, provided each agent ends up with roughly the same number of items. Since there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items while the rest will receive one.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. Item 0: Agent 3 values it at 89, the highest. Assign item 0 to agent 3.
2. Item 1: Agent 3 values it at 87, the highest. Assign item 1 to agent 3.
3. Item 2: Agent 4 values it at 94, the highest. Assign item 2 to agent 4.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 83, the highest. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 99, the highest. Assign item 4 to agent 2.
6. Item 5: Agent 5 values it at 88, the highest. Assign item 5 to agent 5.
7. Item 6: Agent 3 values it at 86, but since agent 3 already has 2 items, assign it to the next highest, agent 4, who values it at 87.
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 75, the highest. Assign item 7 to agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [2, 6],
    "5": [5],
    "6": []
}
```
