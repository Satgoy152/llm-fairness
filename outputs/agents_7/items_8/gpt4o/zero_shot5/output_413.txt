Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  60  94  87  44  28  29  48
1   7  99  57  33  45  64  21  78
2  86  87   3  51  89  10  14  44
3  39  93  77  86  30  93  43  37
4  36  61  14  85  98  82  81  37
5  83  92  65  75  94  88  11  90
6   8  24   1  55  84  79  77  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. Since there are 7 agents and 8 items, we will try to distribute the items such that the maximum valuation is achieved while keeping the allocation fair.

Here's a step-by-step approach to fairly allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: We'll start by checking which items have the highest valuations for each agent.
2. **Assign High-Value Items**: Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that no item is assigned to more than one agent.
3. **Balanced Distribution**: Make sure each agent gets at least one item where possible, and no agent receives more than one item until all agents have at least one.

Let's go through the process:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (value 94).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (value 99).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (value 86).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (value 93), but since it's already assigned to agent 1, we look for the next highest, which is item 5 (value 93).
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most (value 98).
- Agent 5 values item 4 the most (value 94), but since it's assigned to agent 4, we assign the next highest, item 5 (value 88).
- Agent 6 values item 4 the most (value 84), but as item 4 and 5 are taken, we assign item 6 (value 77).

After initial allocation, we have:
- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 7
- Agent 6: Item 6

Since each agent received an item, and all items are allocated, this allocation is fair.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [6]
}
```
