Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  36  46  85  55  90  42  36
1  40  75  62   3  57  24  47  47
2  58  88  96  61  44  45  40   7
3   8  69  58  18  57  26  63   5
4  10  70  37  73  52   4  55  17
5  94  93  64  45  99  15  97  41
6  35  93  24  97  24  89  76  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent that values them the most. Each agent must receive an integer number of items, and all 8 items must be allocated.

Here's how we can achieve this:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent receives at least one item where possible.

Let's go through the process:

- Item 0: Highest value is 94 by agent 5.
- Item 1: Highest value is 93 by agent 5 and 6. Choose agent 5.
- Item 2: Highest value is 96 by agent 2.
- Item 3: Highest value is 97 by agent 6.
- Item 4: Highest value is 99 by agent 5.
- Item 5: Highest value is 90 by agent 0.
- Item 6: Highest value is 97 by agent 5.
- Item 7: Highest value is 47 by agent 1.

Let's allocate the items based on these preferences, ensuring that all 8 items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: Items 0, 1, 4, 6
- Agent 6: Item 3

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "6": [3]
}
```
