Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  85  42   3  63  54  83  84
1  37  32  53  29  87  66  36  31
2  44  17  65  28  77  80  89  35
3  49  30  14  55  23  26  37  46
4  29  27  87  38  40  25  85  58
5  77  36  91  26  31  60  15  50
6  60  90  93  36  96  97  64  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Given the complex nature of this problem, one way to approach it is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items.

Let's determine the allocation step by step:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 5 (77)
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 6 (90)
3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 6 (93)
4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 (55)
5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 6 (96)
6. **Item 5**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 6 (97)
7. **Item 6**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (89)
8. **Item 7**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (84)

With this allocation strategy, we ensure that each item is given to the agent who values it the most. However, given that one agent (Agent 6) receives a disproportionate amount of items, we need to adjust this to distribute items more evenly.

After some adjustments to ensure fairness, the allocation could look like this:

- Agent 0 receives item 7
- Agent 1 receives item 5
- Agent 2 receives item 6
- Agent 3 receives item 3
- Agent 4 receives item 2
- Agent 5 receives item 0
- Agent 6 receives item 1 and item 4

This ensures that each agent receives at least one item, except for Agent 4, and the distribution is more balanced.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [1, 4]
}
```
