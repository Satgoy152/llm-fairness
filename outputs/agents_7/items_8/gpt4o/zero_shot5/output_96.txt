Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  99  38  85  33  73  78  89
1  15  11  12  44  86  77  77   5
2  12  39  39  15  10  29  92  20
3   3  77  82  88  58  40  20  40
4  43   3  23  85  19  12  56  52
5  11  86  24  17  67  12  73  57
6  55  59  57  48   7  87  89  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation of the items each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no items are left unallocated. Since there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items, and all others will receive one item each.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. We choose each agent's highest-valued item where possible to maximize individual satisfaction.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item.
3. The remaining item is given to the agent who has the highest valuation for any remaining unallocated item.

Based on the valuations provided:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 1 (99).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 4 (86).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 6 (92).
4. Agent 3 highly values item 3 (88).
5. Agent 4 highly values item 3 (85), but since item 3 is already given to Agent 3, we look for the next highest valued item for Agent 4, which is item 7 (52).
6. Agent 5 highly values item 1 (86), but since item 1 is already given to Agent 0, we look for the next highest valued item for Agent 5, which is item 4 (67), but item 4 is also given to Agent 1, so we assign item 7 to Agent 5 (57).
7. Agent 6 highly values item 5 (87).

Now, we have these assignments:
- Item 1: Agent 0
- Item 4: Agent 1
- Item 6: Agent 2
- Item 3: Agent 3
- Item 7: Agent 5
- Item 5: Agent 6

Items 0 and 2 are left. We need to assign these to agents who either have less value from their first allocation or haven't been allocated yet.

Agent 4 hasn't been allocated an item yet and values item 0 (43) higher than item 2 (23). Agent 4 will receive item 0.

Agent 5 already has item 7, but values item 2 (24) higher than any other remaining allocations. Therefore, Agent 5 will also receive item 2.

The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7, 2],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.
