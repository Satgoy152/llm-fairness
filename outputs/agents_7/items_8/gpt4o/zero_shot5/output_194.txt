Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  70  53  19  65  26  79  84
1  80  11  98  75  90  77  14  18
2  85   6  54  45  54  68  14  15
3  13  97  56  37  99  23  27  82
4   5  74  51  51  14  63  44  80
5  35  70  82  38  66   1  91  55
6  12  75  38  52  60  55  71  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a number of items such that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. Additionally, we'll aim to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations to ensure fairness.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (79). Assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (98). Assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (85). Assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (99). Assign item 4 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 the highest (80). Assign item 7 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 6 the highest, but it's already taken, so the second highest is item 2, which is also taken. Next highest is item 5 (1). Assign item 5 to agent 5.
7. Agent 6 values item 6 the highest, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 1 (75). Assign item 1 to agent 6.
8. Finally, item 3 remains unallocated. We will assign it to agent 1, who values it the next highest after item 2.

Now we have:

- Agent 0: item 6
- Agent 1: items 2, 3
- Agent 2: item 0
- Agent 3: item 4
- Agent 4: item 7
- Agent 5: item 5
- Agent 6: item 1

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1]
}
```
