Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  49  34  71  82  49  18  48
1  57  18  74  93  20  72   2  63
2  32  23   9   2  22  92  90  70
3  78  86  57  52   6  85  26  78
4  47  10  32  22  10   7  69  92
5  17  34  30  72  89  35  37  49
6  25  17   1  39  83  50   6  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated. One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, checking that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's evaluate the table and allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: 
   - Highest valuation by Agent 0 (94)
2. Item 1: 
   - Highest valuation by Agent 3 (86)
3. Item 2:
   - Highest valuation by Agent 1 (74)
4. Item 3:
   - Highest valuation by Agent 1 (93)
5. Item 4:
   - Highest valuation by Agent 5 (89)
6. Item 5:
   - Highest valuation by Agent 2 (92)
7. Item 6:
   - Highest valuation by Agent 2 (90)
8. Item 7:
   - Highest valuation by Agent 4 (92)

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents based on their preferences.
