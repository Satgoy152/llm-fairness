Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  25  61  46  89  59  72  21
1  77   6  99  87  61  86  53  94
2  75  47  79  93  33  74   9  23
3  13  72  63  71  34   6  11  45
4  93  91  86  39  62   3  37  77
5  80  85  81  30  85  57  78  73
6   5  43  12   6  48  88   2   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

- Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is from agent 4 with a value of 93.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is from agent 4 with a value of 91.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is from agent 1 with a value of 99.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is from agent 2 with a value of 93.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is from agent 0 with a value of 89.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is from agent 6 with a value of 88.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is from agent 5 with a value of 78.
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is from agent 1 with a value of 94.

Now, ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated. Adjust as necessary:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 7
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: No item initially, needs adjustment
- Agent 4: Items 0, 1
- Agent 5: Item 6
- Agent 6: Item 5

Since agent 3 initially has no items, we will adjust by reassigning one item from another agent. We can do this by assigning item 6 (valued at 11 by agent 3) from agent 5 to agent 3.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 1],
    "5": [],
    "6": [5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated. Agent 5 does not receive an item, but all items are allocated while maximizing each agent's values.
