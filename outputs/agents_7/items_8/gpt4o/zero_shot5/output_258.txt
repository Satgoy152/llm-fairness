Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  71   6  25  26  32  96  71
1   5  89  26   8  84  67  55  59
2  76  27  78  50  33  87  25  33
3  98  37  21   8  58  11  24  74
4  32   0  56  30  65   8  19  93
5  17  75  18  31  57  63  85  61
6  56   5  48  66   1  47   1  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 5 89 26  8 84 67 55 59]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, a possible approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation by any agent for each item, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Since there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent may receive two items. Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
- If a tie occurs, choose the agent who has received the fewest items so far.

Here's the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 3 (valuation 98)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (valuation 89)
- Item 2: Agent 2 (valuation 78)
- Item 3: Agent 6 (valuation 66)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (valuation 84)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (valuation 87)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (valuation 96)
- Item 7: Agent 6 (valuation 99)

Now, let's represent this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [3, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to an agent based on the highest valuation, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Agent 1 receives two items since they have the highest valuation for two distinct items. Agents 4 and 5 do not receive any items as they have the lowest valuations for all items compared to other agents.
