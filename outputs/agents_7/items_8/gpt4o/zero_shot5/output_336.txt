Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  32  57  84  56  75  97  17
1   2  21  99   2  27  26  81  90
2  37  15  53  55  49  69  70  38
3  41  59  89  93   9  80  92  62
4  97  71  11  35  48  13  86   2
5  51  63  15  35  46  64  66  47
6  81  98  80  26  51  96  57  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the satisfaction or the total valuation each agent has for the items they receive. We can utilize a greedy approach to achieve an allocation based on each agent's preferences while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and exactly 8 items in total are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 6.
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly.
- Agent 2 has relatively uniform valuations, but item 5 is valued higher.
- Agent 3 values items 3 and 6 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 0 highly.
- Agent 5 has no standout high values, but item 1 is reasonable.
- Agent 6 values item 1 and 5, but we'll focus on distributing remaining items fairly.

Taking these valuations into account, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 1
- Agent 6: Item 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed. Below is the JSON format for this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation aims to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible given the constraint of 8 items.
