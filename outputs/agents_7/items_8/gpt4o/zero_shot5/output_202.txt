Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  17  27  29   7  79  70  63
1  68  79  90  17  50  42  10   4
2  88  82  64  23  28  50  17  12
3  18  82  78  16  24  73  26   1
4  35  10  14  16  64  43  50  83
5  99   5  50  59  92   1  79  10
6  22  41  37  14  95  61  21  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. We'll ensure that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy that tries to distribute the items fairly based on the given valuations:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, redistributing if necessary.

Using this strategy, let's calculate the allocation:

- Item 0: Highest value is 99 by Agent 5.
- Item 1: Highest value is 82 by Agent 2.
- Item 2: Highest value is 90 by Agent 1.
- Item 3: Highest value is 59 by Agent 5.
- Item 4: Highest value is 95 by Agent 6.
- Item 5: Highest value is 79 by Agent 0.
- Item 6: Highest value is 79 by Agent 5.
- Item 7: Highest value is 83 by Agent 4.

Now, ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (79 points)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (90 points)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (82 points)
- Agent 3: Let's reassign Item 3 to Agent 3 (16 points), as it has the next highest value for Agent 3.
- Agent 4: Item 7 (83 points)
- Agent 5: Item 0 and Item 6 (99+79 points)
- Agent 6: Item 4 (95 points)

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0, 6],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and the items are allocated to maximize each agent's valuation.
