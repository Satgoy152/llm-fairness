Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68   6  51  85  85  95  19  10
1  47  25  41  24  80   7  93  50
2  43  37   5  25  57  95  77  29
3  23  61  88  52  35  66  29  58
4  96  33  75  46   9  19  91  80
5  61  25  46  64  27  25  40  53
6  16  13  93  98  60  90  73  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. We have 7 agents and 8 items, so not all agents will receive an item, but we will try to maximize the total valuation.

1. Calculate the highest valuation for each item and allocate it to the agent with the highest valuation. 
2. Ensure that each agent receives at most one item, given there are more agents than items.

Let's go through the items:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 96 by Agent 4.
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 61 by Agent 3.
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 93 by Agent 6.
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 98 by Agent 6.
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 85 by Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Highest value is 95 by Agent 0 and Agent 2. Allocate to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 has already been considered for Item 4).
- **Item 6**: Highest value is 93 by Agent 1.
- **Item 7**: Highest value is 80 by Agent 4.

After considering these allocations, we need to ensure each agent receives at most one item. Since Agent 0 was allocated Item 4 and Item 5, we give Item 5 to Agent 2.

Now, summarizing the allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 0, Item 7
- Agent 6: Item 2, Item 3

Agent 5 will not receive any items.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 7],
    "5": [],
    "6": [2, 3]
}
```
