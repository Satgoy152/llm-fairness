Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  78  80   1   2  13   5  96
1  29   1  74  13  73   4  25  84
2  64  51  28   4  15  32  21  10
3  23  92  97  29  17  81  78  48
4  75  71  73  44  22  25  73  24
5  51  43   4  96  14  40  38  94
6  94  44  64  93   6  80  97  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated, we can consider the valuations given in the table. The goal is to distribute the items such that the total value received by each agent is maximized based on their preferences.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 6. Agent 6 values item 0 the most (94).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 3. Agent 3 values item 1 highly (92).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 3. Agent 3 values item 2 highly (97).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 5. Agent 5 values item 3 highly (96).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1. Agent 1 values item 4 highly (73).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 3. Agent 3 values item 5 highly (81).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 6. Agent 6 values item 6 highly (97).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 0. Agent 0 values item 7 highly (96).

This allocation ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it the most based on the given table. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 2, 5],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation uses all 8 items, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
