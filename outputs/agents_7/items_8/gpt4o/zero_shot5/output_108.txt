Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  96  65  13  82  40  54  67
1  79  42  77  18  26  42  78  93
2  50  63  51  66  11  32  17  22
3  36  91  69  85  92  84   8  10
4  92  91  27  37  96  58  24  94
5  26  42  48  89  43  21  48  81
6   6  17  82  64  27  12  71  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 7 agents, we can use the "maximum value per item" approach. This means we'll assign each item to the agent that values it the most. Let's analyze each item and determine which agent values each item the most:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 4 values it at 92, which is the highest.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 96, which is the highest.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 6 values it at 82, which is the highest.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 5 values it at 89, which is the highest.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 4 values it at 96, which is the highest.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 3 values it at 84, which is the highest.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 1 values it at 78, which is the highest.

8. **Item 7**:
   - Agent 1 values it at 93, which is the highest.

Now, let's allocate the items based on these values:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [6, 7]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [0, 4]
- Agent 5: [3]
- Agent 6: [2]

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 4],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [2]
}
```
