Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  13  51  22  72  15  67  80
1  94  80  14   4  30  19  11  72
2  15  75  14  23  14  32   5  38
3  35  11   7  40  65  16  48   4
4   8  22  53  59  96  95   4  56
5  27  50  43  16  66  25  87  97
6   0  91  85  62  45  90  24  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are allocated. Since there are 7 agents and 8 items, some agents may receive more than one item or none at all. We'll try to balance the allocations to maximize fairness:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value items are 7 (80) and 4 (72).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value items are 0 (94) and 1 (80).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value item is 1 (75).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value item is 4 (65).
5. **Agent 4:** Highest value items are 4 (96) and 5 (95).
6. **Agent 5:** Highest value item is 7 (97).
7. **Agent 6:** Highest value items are 5 (90) and 1 (91).

To allocate:

- Allocate item 7 to Agent 5 (highest value 97).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 4 (highest value 96).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 6 (highest value 90).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value 94).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 6 (next highest value 91 after 5).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (51, highest remaining value for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 (40, highest value for Agent 3).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (67, next highest value after item 2).

This allocation aims to ensure each agent has items they value highly while ensuring all items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [1, 5]
}
```
