Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  73   1  28  29   2  14  41
1  44  60  10  81  47  14  84  79
2  15  27  28   4  81  47  86  71
3  72  42  81  15  92  25  53  40
4  55  23  16  67  33  47  80  38
5  56  56  21   4  28   8  40  32
6  58  46  50   1   7  83  47   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning the items they value the most. Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, some agents may receive more than one item or none at all, depending on their valuations. 

Let's start by examining the table and selecting the highest valued items for each agent in a way that ensures all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value 86).
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value 92).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 81).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 50).
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 6 (value 83).
6. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 79).
7. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 73).
8. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value 81).

This distribution ensures that each item is allocated, and we try to maximize the satisfaction of agents based on their highest valued items.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [5]
}
```
