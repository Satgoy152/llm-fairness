Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  27  81  26  43  95  91  26
1  30  77  59  48  92  73  73  57
2  88   0  63  48  50  36  96  72
3  13  72  28   3  30  76   0  86
4  44  29  22  57  72  23  23   2
5  81   0  30  68  61   2  42  56
6  22  98  20  59  41  99  47  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations given in the table. Our goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

A potential approach to this problem is to use a greedy algorithm, where we iteratively assign the highest-valued unassigned item to the agent who values it the most. This method helps in ensuring that each item is assigned to an agent who values it highly, which contributes to a fair allocation.

Let's carry out this allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value for item 0 is by agent 2 (value: 88).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value for item 1 is by agent 6 (value: 98).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value for item 2 is by agent 0 (value: 81).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value for item 3 is by agent 5 (value: 68).
5. **Item 4**: Highest value for item 4 is by agent 1 (value: 92).
6. **Item 5**: Highest value for item 5 is by agent 6 (value: 99).
7. **Item 6**: Highest value for item 6 is by agent 2 (value: 96).
8. **Item 7**: Highest value for item 7 is by agent 3 (value: 86).

Now, let's compile these allocations into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 7 agents, and each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most.
