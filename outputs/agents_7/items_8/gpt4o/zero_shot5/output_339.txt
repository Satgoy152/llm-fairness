Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  78  11  53  69  28  54  87
1  77  79   1  66  86  80  98  53
2  59   2   6  95  70  97  61  47
3  78  84  90  72  61  15  88  51
4   0  44  13  82   2  97  51  83
5  99  88  57  50  88  82  63  14
6  74  39  33  85  78  32  99  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 78 11 53 69 28 54 87]
 [77 79  1 66 86 80 98 53]
 [59  2  6 95 70 97 61 47]
 [78 84 90 72 61 15 88 51]
 [ 0 44 13 82  2 97 51 83]
 [99 88 57 50 88 82 63 14]
 [74 39 33 85 78 32 99 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider each agent's valuation for the items and distribute the items in such a way that the overall satisfaction is maximized. This means we will try to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations.

Here is one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 7 (value: 87)
- Agent 1: Item 6 (value: 98)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (value: 97)
- Agent 3: Item 2 (value: 90)
- Agent 4: Item 3 (value: 82)
- Agent 5: Item 0 (value: 99)
- Agent 6: Item 4 (value: 78)
- Agent 1 again: Item 1 (value: 79)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing the total value. Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [4]
}
```
