Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  26  65  55  50  97  71  49
1  39  30  45  25  48  63  13  17
2   4  80  41  30  49  46  26  24
3  66  93  60   6  49  56  17  92
4  22  55  96  92  93  57   0  77
5   8  20  31  85  90  98  63  55
6  30  27  69  90  25   1  71  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we can use a simple approach that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives as much as possible. Given the valuations provided, we'll try to distribute items such that the total value each agent receives is as close as possible to each other.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives items: 5
2. Agent 1 receives items: 2, 4
3. Agent 2 receives items: 1
4. Agent 3 receives items: 3, 7
5. Agent 4 receives items: 6
6. Agent 5 receives items: 0
7. Agent 6 receives items: None

This allocation distributes the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item where possible and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.
