Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  70  58  34  35  80  32  40
1  48  56  64  46  56   9  90  40
2  91  77  59  94  36  34   0  71
3  91  16  18  76  99  72  27   4
4  23  14   6   5  67  85  57  11
5  93  92  37  55  73   5  16  99
6  26   8  10  58   0  42  99  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items and exactly 8 items are allocated in total.

One potential approach is to allocate items to agents based on who values them the most, while ensuring every agent gets at least one item. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring fairness by giving at least one item to each agent.

2. We can assign the items as follows:

- Item 0: Agent 5 (value 93)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (value 70)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (value 64)
- Item 3: Agent 2 (value 94)
- Item 4: Agent 3 (value 99)
- Item 5: Agent 4 (value 85)
- Item 6: Agent 6 (value 99)
- Item 7: Agent 5 (value 99)

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 5
- Agent 5: Items 0, 7
- Agent 6: Item 6

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 7],
    "6": [6]
}
```
