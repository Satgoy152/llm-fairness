Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  99  69  52  22  33  49  12
1  21  62  62  99  45  54  44  77
2  84  80  79  69  72  61  33  90
3  65  86  68  40  98  74   0  50
4  58  38  39  37  55  40   2  13
5  49  64  65   9  39  89  39  98
6  70  59  89   9  83  15  43  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute them such that each agent gets at least one item, and the overall allocation maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Look at each agent's highest-valued items and try to assign those items if they are not already assigned.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item to balance the allocation.

After considering these points, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most, so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most, so assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most, so assign item 7 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most, so assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most, so assign item 0 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 5 the most, so assign item 5 to Agent 5.
- Agent 6 values item 2 the most, so assign item 2 to Agent 6.
- Finally, assign item 6, which is still unallocated, to Agent 3 since they have the next highest value for it.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items distributed is 8.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2]
}
```
