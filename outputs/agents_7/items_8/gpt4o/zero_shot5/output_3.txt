Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  76  65  82  24  18  93  88
1  44  54  45  16   8  90  67   4
2  72  58  11  68  44  66  94  13
3  40   8  45  75  88  76  68   0
4  15  54  41  90  74  27  63  63
5   8  25  32  80  38  17  36  67
6  98  87  72  43  59  55  25   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we need to distribute all 8 items in a manner that balances fairness and maximizes the agents' valuations. A reasonable approach is to give each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, considering that some agents may end up with no items due to the constraint of having exactly 8 items in total.

Let's assign the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 95.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 90.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 the highest at 94.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest at 88.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the highest at 90.
6. Agent 5 values item 7 the highest at 67.
7. Agent 6 values item 0 the highest at 98.

Since item 0 is desired by both Agent 0 and Agent 6, we may need to adjust the assignments. To distribute fairly, we'll have to make some adjustments:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 6, as it provides the highest valuation to any agent.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 6 (valued at 87 by Agent 6, second highest for them).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- No items left for Agent 5, but they have other allocations that could potentially work if items are reassigned. However, with only 8 items, not all agents can receive an item.

Here is the JSON format allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning them items they value most, given the constraint of distributing only 8 items.
