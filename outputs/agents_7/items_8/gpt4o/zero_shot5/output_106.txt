Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  90  25  70  14  80  13  38
1  72  15  61  27  46  83  56  94
2  43  63  26  95   2   6  83   9
3  60   3   1  60  58  59  35  89
4  53  74  27  59  31   2  62  90
5  42  50   7  80  52  61  40  90
6  24  18  46  45   2  70  63  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to distribute the items such that the total valuation is somewhat balanced among them. Each agent should receive at least one item if possible, given there are 8 items and 7 agents. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items 0 and 1 the most.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 7 the highest.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the highest.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 7 highly but since it's taken, item 5 is the next best.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 1 the highest.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 3 highly but since it's taken, item 4 is the next best.
7. **Agent 6**: Values item 6 the highest.

Considering the above preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 7.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 5.
- Agent 4 gets item 2.
- Agent 5 gets item 4.
- Agent 6 gets item 6.

This distribution ensures that each agent gets at least one item (except one agent who will receive two due to the number of items), and the allocation leverages the highest valuations wherever possible.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation makes sure that all 8 items are distributed among the agents according to their preferences as much as possible.
