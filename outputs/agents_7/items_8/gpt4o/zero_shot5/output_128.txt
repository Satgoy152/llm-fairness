Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  98  54  20  94  40  12  12
1  66  14  41  11  64  19  15  88
2  60   9  43  67  90  43  15  18
3  65  94  91  67  91  54  17  54
4  17  95   1  43  63  65  48  95
5  57  41   1  94  27  37  97  89
6  46  42  10  26  83  44  52  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items must be distributed among the 7 agents. A fair allocation would attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0: Assign item 0, as they have the highest valuation for it.
2. Agent 1: Assign item 7, as they have the highest valuation for it.
3. Agent 2: Assign item 4, as they have the highest valuation for it.
4. Agent 3: Assign items 1 and 3, as they have high valuations for these items.
5. Agent 4: Assign item 5, as they have a high valuation for it.
6. Agent 5: Assign item 6, as they have the highest valuation for it.
7. Agent 6: Assign item 2, as they have a reasonable valuation for it.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, while attempting to maximize their satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.
