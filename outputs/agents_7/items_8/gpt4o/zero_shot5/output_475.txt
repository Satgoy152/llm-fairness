Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  81  55  30  26  23  88  68
1  57  45  15  76  10   0  57  67
2  79  53   5  92  58  35  85  62
3  67  40  33  70  17  20  53  94
4  57   3  50  80  71  41  18  66
5  31  32  25  73   3  88  18  16
6  42  14  21  71  17  56  32  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent has a fair share based on their valuations. A common approach for such problems is to use a variant of the "divide and choose" strategy or a "maximum marginal return" approach. However, given the constraints and the request for a fair allocation, I'll attempt to balance the total value each agent receives.

Based on the table, here is one possible allocation that attempts to distribute the items fairly:

- Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 6] (total value: 161)
- Agent 1: Items [3, 7] (total value: 143)
- Agent 2: Item [2] (total value: 5)
- Agent 3: Item [5] (total value: 20)
- Agent 4: Item [4] (total value: 71)
- Agent 5: Item [1] (total value: 32)
- Agent 6: Item [] (no item)

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": []
}
```
