Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  13  27  70  67  55  41  71
1  46  86  13  68  93  55  23  74
2  21  38  38  51  86  23  94  32
3   7   1  73  15  52  51  59  99
4  81  73  49  44  62  11  74  41
5  85  83  28  56  94  60  10  91
6   3  59  61  62  58  72  57  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total satisfaction or valuation of each agent based on the matrix provided. One potential way is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others receive 1 item each.

Let's analyze the values and determine the best allocation:

1. **Item 0:** Highest value is 85 by Agent 5.
2. **Item 1:** Highest value is 86 by Agent 1.
3. **Item 2:** Highest value is 73 by Agent 3.
4. **Item 3:** Highest value is 70 by Agent 0.
5. **Item 4:** Highest value is 94 by Agent 5.
6. **Item 5:** Highest value is 72 by Agent 6.
7. **Item 6:** Highest value is 94 by Agent 2.
8. **Item 7:** Highest value is 99 by Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets Item 3.
- Agent 1 gets Item 1.
- Agent 2 gets Item 6.
- Agent 3 gets Item 2 and Item 7.
- Agent 4 gets no items.
- Agent 5 gets Item 0 and Item 4.
- Agent 6 gets Item 5.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 4],
    "6": [5]
}
```
