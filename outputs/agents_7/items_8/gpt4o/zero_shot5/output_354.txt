Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  62  54  55  14  36  76  74
1  28  17  14  85  69  43  79  72
2  81  53  70  25  47  58  89   9
3  63  93  61  87  43  25  39  79
4  27  28   6  98   7  70  78  10
5  92   1  35  10  63  13  76  67
6  81  33  80  42  62  82  67  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. 

Here's a potential allocation strategy:
- Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's look at each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation:

1. Item 0: Highest valuation is by agent 5 with 92.
2. Item 1: Highest valuation is by agent 3 with 93.
3. Item 2: Highest valuation is by agent 6 with 80.
4. Item 3: Highest valuation is by agent 4 with 98.
5. Item 4: Highest valuation is by agent 1 with 69.
6. Item 5: Highest valuation is by agent 6 with 82.
7. Item 6: Highest valuation is by agent 2 with 89.
8. Item 7: Highest valuation is by agent 0 with 74.

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item. If any agent hasn't received an item, reassign the allocation to give them an item, while aiming to minimize the overall decrease in valuation.

Here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 7
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 3
- Agent 5: Item 0
- Agent 6: Item 2, Item 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, with all items allocated optimally based on their valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [2, 5]
}
```
