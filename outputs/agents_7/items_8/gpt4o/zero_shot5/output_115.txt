Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99   7   5   8  12  18  61  57
1  95  44  43  39  62  91  15  49
2  52  75  33  69  95  18  50  26
3  97  81  82  48  52   9  82  30
4  45  93  94  44  93  17  16  33
5  27   3  41  47  30  28  94  56
6  55  10  43  79  99  35   1   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 7 agents, we can aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given that there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each. Below is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 0 (Value: 99)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 5 (Value: 91)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 4 (Value: 95)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 2 (Value: 82)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 1 (Value: 93)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 6 (Value: 94)
7. **Agent 6**: Item 3 (Value: 79)
   
Now, we need to allocate the last item. Agent 1 has room for another item with significant value: Item 7 (Value: 49).

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [3]
}
```
