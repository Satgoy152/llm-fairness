Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  17  77  67  28   1  84  83
1  55  26  99  58  48  96  36   5
2  86  67   8  11  22  57  14  67
3  40  75  32   6  45  88  34  18
4  73  75  57  72  15  26  24  68
5  88   8  95  93  59  37   4  91
6  93  84   2  51  65  54  57  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible, given there are 7 agents and 8 items. 

Let's follow a simple heuristic approach where we assign the highest valued item that hasn't been assigned yet to an agent who values it the most.

1. **Agent 5 gets Item 2** (Value: 95)
2. **Agent 1 gets Item 5** (Value: 96)
3. **Agent 0 gets Item 6** (Value: 84)
4. **Agent 6 gets Item 0** (Value: 93)
5. **Agent 4 gets Item 3** (Value: 72)
6. **Agent 2 gets Item 7** (Value: 67)
7. **Agent 3 gets Item 1** (Value: 75)
8. **Agent 0 gets Item 4** (Value: 28) - As Agent 0 has the next highest value for an unallocated item.

By following this allocation, each agent receives an item, and all items are allocated.

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and it considers maximizing valuations based on the available data.
