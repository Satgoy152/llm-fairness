Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  61  52   5  36  81  88  53
1  70  34  30  63  73  42  26  78
2  74  71  31  60  28  93  61  11
3  67   0  57  25  58  61  81  26
4  61  43  11  97  49  35  79  59
5  89  82  55  45  21  32  71  66
6  15  33  77  81  68  86  17  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for a balanced distribution where each agent gets approximately the same number of items. Since there are 7 agents and 8 items, each agent can receive at least one item, with one agent receiving an additional item. We also need to consider the valuations to optimize the distribution based on the preferences of the agents.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest value an agent places on an item and allocate that item to the agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. For the remaining items, allocate them to the agent with the next highest valuation for those items, ensuring each item is distributed.

Here is one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for item 6.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 6 has a high valuation for item 4.

This initial allocation ensures each agent receives one item based on their highest valuation:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [1]
- Agent 6: [4]

Now, we have 7 items allocated, and one item (item 7) remains to be allocated. We can allocate this item to the agent who values it the most and hasn't already received the highest number of items (since each agent started with one item):

- Agent 1 values item 7 most among other agents.

Thus, allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly, and each agent gets at least one item.
