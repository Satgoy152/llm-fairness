Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  84  67  96  17  85  78  85
1  94  73  10   7  18  49   6  44
2   9  53  79  67  41  84  21  12
3   4  97  78  44  31  97  51  35
4  27  38  50  14  36  70  38  17
5  80  81  18  96   3  24  47  80
6  16  43  92  23  70  13  19  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the total value of items as evenly as possible while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. To do this, we'll consider each agent's preferences based on their valuations and attempt to balance the total value received by each agent.

Given the constraints, one potential allocation could be as follows:

1. Assign each agent one item based on their highest valuation that hasn't been assigned yet.
2. Adjust the assignments to ensure all items are distributed, considering each agent's total value.

After careful consideration and balancing based on valuations, here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [4, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 3, which is their highest valued item.
- Agent 1 receives item 0, which provides a high valuation.
- Agent 2 receives item 5, offering a high value.
- Agent 3 gets item 1, their top choice.
- Agent 4 is allocated item 2.
- Agent 5 receives item 7.
- Agent 6 receives items 4 and 6 to balance out the distribution, considering their lower individual valuations.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are fairly distributed in terms of total value based on the agents' preferences.
