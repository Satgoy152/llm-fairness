Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  39  61   7   5  98  66  63
1  57   0  19  30  31  10  66  63
2  87  47   8   5  26  61  99  99
3  58  49  12  54  13  33  67  66
4   8  90  22  10  50  82  60  58
5  42  45   0  94  25  13  38  11
6  96  11  74  51  72  85  94  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [96 11 74 51 72 85 94 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we iteratively assign items to the agents that value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Given the data, let's assign the items as follows:

1. Agent 6 values item 0 the most with a valuation of 96.
2. Agent 4 values item 1 the most with a valuation of 90.
3. Agent 6 has the highest remaining valuation of 94 for item 6.
4. Agent 2 values item 7 the most with a valuation of 99.
5. Agent 0 values item 5 the most with a valuation of 98.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the most with a valuation of 94.
7. Agent 0 values item 2 the most with a valuation of 61.
8. Agent 1 values item 4 the most with a valuation of 31.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item where possible.
