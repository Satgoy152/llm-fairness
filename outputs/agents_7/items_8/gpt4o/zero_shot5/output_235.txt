Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  99  40  29  42  24   8  16
1  17   3  11  23  16   1  71  31
2  34  11  10  73  89  43  95  15
3  21  77   8  46   2  51  22  19
4  43  90   2  43  61  15  11  16
5  53  58  80  23  18  75  74  36
6   8  41  50  30  70  96  70  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, I will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, ensuring that all 8 items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 1.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 6.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 4.
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 1, but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: Has the highest valuation for item 1, but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 4, but it's also assigned. Next is item 0.
6. **Agent 5**: Has the highest valuation for item 2.
7. **Agent 6**: Has the highest valuation for item 5, but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 3.

After assigning based on highest preferences, verify the allocation and adjust if necessary to ensure that each item is assigned and fairness is maintained. Here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent receives at least one item as fairly as possible given the constraints.
