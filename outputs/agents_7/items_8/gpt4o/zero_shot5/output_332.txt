Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  29  24  67  71  93  34  15
1  38  84  13  14  99  80  52  82
2   7  78  86  52  52  64  32  10
3   2   6  70  59  98  30  33  39
4  43  43  70  26  98  38   5  25
5  95  49  76   1  95  75  10  18
6  95  86  15  46  45  27  77  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while respecting their valuations, we can use the method of maximizing the total value for each agent. We will consider each agent's preferences and try to allocate items such that the overall satisfaction (valuation) is maximized. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 5 and 4. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the most; allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 highly, but since it's already taken, consider item 3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has equal high values for items 4 and 2, but both are taken, so allocate item 0, which is next highest and free.
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 0, but it's taken. Allocate item 1, as it is the next highest available.
7. **Agent 6** values item 6 the most. Allocate item 6 to Agent 6.

Let's check if all items are allocated:

Allocated items: 5, 4, 2, 3, 0, 1, 6.

We still need to allocate item 7. Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 6, as Agent 6 has no other high-value items and can benefit from an additional item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [6, 7]
}
```
