Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  44  28  17  16  56  46  62
1  68  38  63  27  92  23  59  64
2  65  29  40  63   2  33  63  92
3  87  35  76  51  98  49  42  53
4  31  82  33  77  81  24  61  42
5  78  10  64   0  58  64  31  53
6  90  87  45  96  29  82  35   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given the data, we can follow a strategy of assigning items based on the highest valuations per agent while ensuring every agent receives at least one item when possible.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item first.
2. Ensure all items are allocated.

Let's do this step by step:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the highest at 62, so we assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 92, so we assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the highest at 92, but since it's already taken, we assign item 3 (their next highest value at 63) to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest at 98, but it's already taken, so we assign item 0 (their next highest value at 87) to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest at 82, so we assign item 1 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 5 the highest at 64, so we assign item 5 to Agent 5.
- Agent 6 values item 3 the highest at 96, but since it's already taken, we assign item 0 (their next highest value at 90) to Agent 6. However, item 0 is taken, so we assign item 1 (second highest value at 87) to Agent 6.

Now, we need to ensure all items are allocated and resolve any possible conflicts:

- Items 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 are allocated. Items 2 and 6 need to be allocated.

Since Agent 6 has no items and item 6 is still available, assign item 6 to Agent 6.

Finally, item 2 is unallocated. Agent 0 has only one item, so we'll give item 2 to Agent 0 since they have a reasonable valuation for it.

Now, the allocations can be presented in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed while considering the agents' valuations and ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
