Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  21   7   5  82  28  31  80
1  66  58  24   6  20  22  28  50
2  82  85  39  27  72  41  31  50
3  38  44  49  58  89  33  61  94
4   8  86  70   6  38  47  56  19
5  14  30  93  47  61  18  45  72
6  17   6  79  50  55  55  16  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives items that maximize their value while ensuring that all items are allocated. There are various methods to achieve this, but one simple approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's break down the allocation based on the given table:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 82.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the highest at 86.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 5 values it the highest at 93.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 58.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 89.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 41.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 61.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 94.

Now, let's ensure that each agent can receive an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. If an agent receives too many items, we can reassign items to other agents who also value them relatively highly, maintaining fairness.

Based on the above greedy allocation and ensuring fairness, we can adjust some allocations to balance the distribution:

- Agent 0: [ ]
- Agent 1: [ ]
- Agent 2: [0, 5]
- Agent 3: [3, 4, 6, 7]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [2]
- Agent 6: [ ]

This allocation gives us the following JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [3, 4, 6, 7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while trying to maximize the value for each agent.
