Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  24  80  42  28  67  24  18
1  12  46  51  65  17  71  71  80
2  96  52  30  94  66  13  44  91
3  12  27  75  13  88  89  18  13
4  46  92   0  43  49  87   1  25
5  19   4  64  10  13  79  24  95
6  75  69  27  66  98  81  30  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55 24 80 42 28 67 24 18]
 [12 46 51 65 17 71 71 80]
 [96 52 30 94 66 13 44 91]
 [12 27 75 13 88 89 18 13]
 [46 92  0 43 49 87  1 25]
 [19  4 64 10 13 79 24 95]
 [75 69 27 66 98 81 30 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item, if possible, given the constraints. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 80)
- Agent 1 gets item 7 (value 80)
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 96)
- Agent 3 gets item 5 (value 89)
- Agent 4 gets item 1 (value 92)
- Agent 5 gets item 6 (value 24)
- Agent 6 gets item 4 (value 98) and item 3 (value 66)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize individual agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [4, 3]
}
```
