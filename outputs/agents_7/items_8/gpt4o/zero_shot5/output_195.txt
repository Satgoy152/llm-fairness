Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  34  62  76  72  60  84  33
1  40  77  60  75  67  80  22  18
2  86  78  59  60  84  48   5  96
3   9  53  78  17  72  46  75  98
4  90  47  91  10  25  75  22  48
5  63  62  92  62  28  69  57  28
6  70  20  23  14  51  77  89  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider both the number of items each agent receives and the value each agent places on the items they receive. Given there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the remaining agents will receive 1 item each.

Let's try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring fairness:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 6 the most at 84.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 5 the most at 80.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 0 the most at 86.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 7 the most at 98.
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 2 the most at 91.
6. **Agent 5:** Values item 2 the most at 92 (already taken by Agent 4, so the next highest is item 5 at 69, which is taken by Agent 1, so the next highest is item 1 at 62).
7. **Agent 6:** Values item 7 the most at 96 (already taken by Agent 3, so the next highest is item 6 at 89).

After each agent picks their highest-valued item not yet allocated, we need to assign the remaining item.

Let's finalize the allocations:

- Item 0: Allocated to Agent 2
- Item 1: Allocated to Agent 5
- Item 2: Allocated to Agent 4
- Item 3: Allocated to Agent 0 (Agent 0's next highest-valued available item)
- Item 4: Allocated to Agent 6 (Agent 6's next highest-valued available item)
- Item 5: Allocated to Agent 1
- Item 6: Allocated to Agent 0
- Item 7: Allocated to Agent 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item, with one agent (Agent 0) receiving two items to account for all 8 items.
