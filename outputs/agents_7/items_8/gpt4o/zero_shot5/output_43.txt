Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21   1  79  55   9  96  39  53
1  50  85  35  31  43  39  49  56
2  53  27   6  49  71  87  11  35
3  21  65  70  28  37  41  69  25
4  97  96  16  16  21  49  90  99
5  18  67  26  42  73  22  78  92
6  44  16  96  60  38  67  94  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive two items, and the rest will receive one each. We will try to allocate based on the highest preference an agent has for an item that hasn't been allocated yet.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 4** has a high value for item 7 (99) and item 0 (97).
2. **Agent 0** values item 5 (96) highly.
3. **Agent 6** values item 2 (96) highly.
4. **Agent 1** values item 1 (85) highly.
5. **Agent 2** values item 5 (87) highly, but it's already taken. The next best available is item 4 (71).
6. **Agent 3** values item 2 (70) highly, but it's already taken. The next best available is item 6 (69).
7. **Agent 5** values item 4 (73), but it's already taken. The next best available is item 7 (92), but it's already taken by Agent 4, so Agent 5 gets item 3 (42).

Following this allocation strategy, we arrive at the following distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7, 0],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [2]
}
```
