Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  92  12  36  72  30   1  57
1  32  46  21  51   6  17  21  19
2  95  61  38  62  54  67  53  60
3  95  64  98  77  92  28  16  93
4  92  18  38  23  53  64  42  13
5  79  24  47  92  83  34  43  74
6  67  96  94  54  46  46  20  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [32 46 21 51  6 17 21 19]
 [95 61 38 62 54 67 53 60]

 [79 24 47 92 83 34 43 74]
 [67 96 94 54 46 46 20 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total value for each agent is maximized given the constraints.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 should get item 0, because it has a high value of 75.
- Agent 1 should get item 3, because it has a relatively high value of 51.
- Agent 2 should get item 5, because it has a high value of 67.
- Agent 3 should get item 2 and item 7, because these items have high values of 98 and 93 respectively.
- Agent 4 should get item 6, because it has a value of 42 which is relatively higher than other options for this agent.
- Agent 5 should get item 4, because it has a high value of 83.
- Agent 6 should get item 1, because it has a high value of 96.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [1]
}
```
