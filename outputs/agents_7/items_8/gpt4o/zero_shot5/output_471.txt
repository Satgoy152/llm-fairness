Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  38  86  32  67  44  71  38
1  71  73  16  46   3  56  97  70
2  57  32  39  41  51  56   7  41
3  90  38   8  40  63  99  96  48
4  39  89  89  82  14  20  48  39
5  27  39  77  85  20   4  64  47
6   8  95  61  28  82   4  50  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value received by all agents. The goal is to distribute items in a way that considers each agent's valuation of the items.

Based on the given valuations, here is a proposed allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the most.
3. Agent 2 can be given item 5, which is one of the higher values for them.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 significantly.
5. Agent 4 can receive item 1, where they have a high valuation.
6. Agent 5 can take item 7, which is a reasonable value for them.
7. Agent 6 is left with item 4, which they value the highest compared to other agents.

Given these considerations, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item (except for Agent 0 who gets two due to their high valuations), and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
