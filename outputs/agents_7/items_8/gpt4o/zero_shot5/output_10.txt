Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  12  21  89  28  59  33  31
1  96  11  97  13  72  13  65  41
2   0  32  42  82  70  90  63  55
3  39  43  79  74  89  94  88  47
4  74  98  14  99  63  64  85  82
5  11  18  32  98  85  91  90  30
6  58  29  76  70   6  52  32  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 8. A common approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Analyze each item to see which agent values it the most:
   - Item 0: Highest value is 96 by agent 1.
   - Item 1: Highest value is 98 by agent 4.
   - Item 2: Highest value is 97 by agent 1.
   - Item 3: Highest value is 99 by agent 4.
   - Item 4: Highest value is 89 by agent 3.
   - Item 5: Highest value is 94 by agent 3.
   - Item 6: Highest value is 90 by agent 5.
   - Item 7: Highest value is 82 by agent 4.

2. Allocate the items based on the highest valuation:
   - Agent 0: No items.
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 2.
   - Agent 2: No items.
   - Agent 3: Items 4, 5.
   - Agent 4: Items 1, 3, 7.
   - Agent 5: Item 6.
   - Agent 6: No items.

Finally, the allocations are as follows in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [1, 3, 7],
    "5": [6],
    "6": []
}
```
