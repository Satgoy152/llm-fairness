Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93   3  66  98  59   8  98  26
1  85  39  19  87  39  51  25  49
2  18  10  42  34   5  94  15  51
3  17  48  24  41  31  72  69  56
4  52  83  61  55  21  54  41  86
5  28  30  34  35   7  84  41  54
6  86  48  57  98  22  79  42  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items considering the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that we have 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will inevitably receive more than one item.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Each agent should ideally receive at least one item, but since we have 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive two items.
2. We can use a "maximum value" strategy by assigning each item to the agent that values it the most, which often results in a fair initial distribution.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (93)
- Item 1: Agent 4 (83)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (66)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (98)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (59)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (94)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (98)
- Item 7: Agent 4 (86)

Now we have:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Items 1, 7
- Agent 5: No items
- Agent 6: No items

This allocation heavily favors Agent 0, so let's distribute it more fairly by reassigning some items:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 6 (57)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (39)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 3 (69)

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Item 0, 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Items 1, 7
- Agent 5: No items
- Agent 6: Item 2

This allocation gives each agent (except Agent 5) at least one item and distributes the items based on the highest valuations where possible.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 7],
    "5": [],
    "6": [2]
}
```
