Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  17  95  80  38  36  93  40
1  30  91  92  84  17  25   6  38
2  93  89  66   8  48  79  95  26
3  53  68  49  19  70  14  18  13
4   1  54  90  77  21  97  12  33
5  28   5  92   6  23  79  23  50
6  19   2   7  27  14  14  47  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value relatively more compared to the other items available. A common approach is to use a method like the "max-min fair allocation" or "envy-free allocation," which seeks to maximize the minimum satisfaction or reduce envy among agents.

Given the table of valuations, we can attempt to assign items to agents by ensuring that each agent receives at least one item they value highly. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 2 (95).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (91).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 6 (95).
4. Agent 3 highly values item 4 (70).
5. Agent 4 highly values item 5 (97).
6. Agent 5 highly values item 7 (50).
7. Agent 6 highly values item 3 (27).
8. For the remaining items, we can assign item 0 to Agent 0 as they also have a relatively high valuation for it (33).

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents based on their preferences.
