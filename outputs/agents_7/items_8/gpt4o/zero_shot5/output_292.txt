Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  64  13  29   5  49  77  78
1   1  33  45  79  54  14  79  35
2  74  78  43   9   1  39  94  99
3  10  12  67  29  50  48  73  81
4  71  99  78  52  84  94  95  57
5  12  95  50  94  61  36  78   1
6  23  64  47  12   3   4  55  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that a total of 8 items are allocated. We can aim to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation of their assigned items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Valuation for items are relatively lower compared to others, but item 1 and 7 have considerable value.
2. **Agent 1:** Has a high valuation for item 3.
3. **Agent 2:** Has a very high valuation for item 7.
4. **Agent 3:** Has a consistent valuation, with item 6 and 7 being notable.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest valuation for item 1.
6. **Agent 5:** Highest valuation for item 3.
7. **Agent 6:** Considerably lower valuations, but item 1 has the highest value for them.

Considering the above observations, we can follow this allocation:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 4, since it has the highest value for this agent.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 5, as it is the highest value item for them.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2, since they value it the most.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3, as it has a high value for them.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4, as it has a high valuation and balances their allocation.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it has a high value for them and balances their allocation.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it is the highest remaining value for them.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it balances the distribution.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 5],
    "5": [3],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share according to the given valuations.
