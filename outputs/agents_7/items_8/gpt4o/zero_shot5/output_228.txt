Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86   5  10  57  20  98  52  22
1  74  37  79  49  55  10  91  38
2  33  77  53  26  28  51  22  37
3  22  45   1  86  68  46  84  30
4  11  85  83  55  54  61  59   0
5  34  89  59  81  49  78  59  71
6  68  26  79  44  95  73  77  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Given there are 7 agents and 8 items, ideally, each agent would receive at least one item, with one agent receiving two items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 5 with a value of 98.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 6 with a value of 91.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 with a value of 77.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 3 with a value of 86.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 1 with a value of 85. However, item 1 is already allocated to Agent 2, so we allocate the next highest value, item 2 with a value of 83.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for Agent 5 is item 1 with a value of 89. However, item 1 is already allocated to Agent 2, so we allocate the next highest value, item 5 with a value of 78.
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value for Agent 6 is item 4 with a value of 95.

After this allocation, we have allocated all 8 items. Below is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [],
    "6": [4]
}
```

Note: To ensure all items are allocated, we will also allocate the remaining item, which is item 7. Given the constraints, we can allocate it to Agent 5, who currently has no items. Therefore, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
