Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  48  15  71  91  50  93  22
1  72  93  67  77  24  47  64  40
2  67  95  43  15  46  46   7  16
3  88  96  37  50  98  67  78  42
4  90  12  70  28  12  19  32  81
5  66  74  81  90  15  86   6   6
6  57  44  94  26  59  93  42  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while taking into account their valuations, we can use a strategy to ensure each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value of the items. This approach could involve maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their preferences, while ensuring no items are left unallocated and each item is assigned to one agent only.

Here's a possible allocation using a simple greedy algorithm:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If there are ties (i.e., multiple agents value the item equally), choose any one of those agents randomly.

Following this strategy, here are the allocations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (value 96)
- Item 1: Agent 3 (value 96)
- Item 2: Agent 6 (value 94)
- Item 3: Agent 5 (value 90)
- Item 4: Agent 3 (value 98)
- Item 5: Agent 6 (value 93)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (value 93)
- Item 7: Agent 4 (value 81)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [2, 5]
}
```
