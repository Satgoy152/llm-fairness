Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  71  95  84  97  40  25  87
1  66  79  99  71  62  22  72  16
2  10  39  86  91  93  53  77  11
3  86  55  30  69  13   4   3  95
4  44  43  86  35  58  44   5  79
5  83  58  63  25   2  49  65  16
6  87   2   9  17  67  95  62  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are distributed. One approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations for each agent.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 4 (97).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 2 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 3 (91).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 7 (95).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 2 (86), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 7 (79), but it's also taken. The next highest is item 3 (35), but it's also taken. Therefore, we can allocate item 1 (43).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value is for item 0 (83).
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value is for item 5 (95).

Let's check if all items have been allocated and make adjustments if necessary:

- Items allocated so far: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 1
- Remaining item: 6

We can assign the remaining item to the agent with the next highest valuation that doesn't already have their highest item:

- **Agent 6** can take item 6 (62).

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.
