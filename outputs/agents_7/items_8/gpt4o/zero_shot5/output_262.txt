Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43   8  24  58  87  83  15  51
1  96  39  30  34  27   1  82  83
2  95  79  53   2  95   0  26  29
3  13  72  32  88   5  53  13  21
4  37  35  54  75  18  17  37  65
5  67   3  36  24  58   0  63  47
6  17   7  85  56  61  61  32  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated equals 8. We can consider maximizing each agent's total valuation from their allocated items while trying to distribute the items evenly among the agents.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Check if the distribution is fair, and adjust if necessary to ensure each agent has at least one item (if possible), and the total number of items allocated equals 8.

Using this approach, we get the following allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (Value: 96)
- Item 1: Agent 2 (Value: 79)
- Item 2: Agent 6 (Value: 85)
- Item 3: Agent 3 (Value: 88)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (Value: 87)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (Value: 83)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (Value: 82)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (Value: 51)

After assigning the items, it appears that not every agent receives an item immediately. To ensure a fair distribution where the total number of items allocated remains 8, let's adjust the allocations so that each agent receives at least one item. 

Here's a revised allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [2, 7]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 6.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.
- Agent 6 receives items 2 and 7.
- Agents 4 and 5 do not receive any items.

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and the total number of items remains 8.
