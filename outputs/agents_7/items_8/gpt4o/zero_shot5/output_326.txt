Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  17  19  50  39  74  12  70
1  92  49   4  31  74  70  86  43
2  15  93   8   9  97  68  36  81
3  54  89  90  56  77  68  48   2
4  16   3  31  82  96  57  15  74
5  92   4  41  60  52  82  25  34
6  64  49  98  62  45  34  65  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the items based on their valuations. Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, some agents may receive more than one item or none at all, while others may receive only one. The aim is to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. 

Let's go through a possible allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 0 (83).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 0 (92), but it is already taken, so the next highest that is available is item 6 (86).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest available value is item 4 (97).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest available value is item 2 (90).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest available value is item 3 (82).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest available value is item 5 (82).
7. **Agent 6**: The highest available value is item 7 (94).

This approach ensures that each agent gets an item with a high valuation, and all items are distributed among the agents. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [7]
}
```
