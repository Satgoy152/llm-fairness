Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  47  73  24  56  61  87  52
1   4  70  74   1  58  63  72  94
2  73  27  94   2  52  83  72  86
3  59  52  28  54  75  48  18  11
4  55  76  14  38  86  96  96  28
5  42  48  87  26  92  54  42  80
6   6  31   7  66  71  31  48   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, where feasible, given there are more items than agents. The approach is to iteratively assign items to the agent with the highest valuation for that unallocated item.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (94).
2. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for items 5 (96) and 6 (96).
3. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 4 (92).
4. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 7 (94).
5. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 6 after agent 4, but since agent 4 already has two items, Agent 0 gets item 6 (87).
6. Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 3 (66).
7. Agent 3 is left with item 0 (59).

The allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [3]
}
```
