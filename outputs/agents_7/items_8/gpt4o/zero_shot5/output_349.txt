Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  24   2  83  47  53  34  64
1  40  37  12  79  86  49  41  78
2  68  42  72  43  36  54  20  35
3  33   1  11  89  45  21  27   8
4  96  96  92  92  53  16  18  18
5  19  58  99  88  96  70  95  60
6  33  32   4  86  38  38  26  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 32  4 86 38 38 26 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we can aim for a balanced distribution where each agent receives at least one item, and the total value assigned to each agent is somewhat balanced. However, since there are 7 agents and only 8 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each. 

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (Value: 83)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (Value: 86)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (Value: 72)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (Value: 33)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (Value: 96)
- Agent 5: Items 5 and 6 (Values: 70 and 95)
- Agent 6: Item 7 (Value: 28)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and one agent receives two items. The distribution also attempts to balance the values to some extent.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5, 6],
    "6": [7]
}
```
