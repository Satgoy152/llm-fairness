Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  59   1  61  47  10  45  71
1  84  40  25  22  56  93  27  28
2  36  24  85  33   5  88  58  97
3  99  62  57  30   7  81  92  83
4  12  59  83  94  60   8  12  70
5  47  92  67  99  27  28  32  87
6  78  51  42  88  74  54   2  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One possible approach is to assign items based on each agent's highest valuation for unallocated items, while ensuring that no agent receives more than one item until all agents have at least one item, if possible. 

Below is a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value 97).
2. Assign item 3 to agent 5 (value 99).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 3 (value 99).
4. Assign item 1 to agent 5 (value 92).
5. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 93).
6. Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value 92).
7. Assign item 2 to agent 4 (value 83).
8. Assign item 4 to agent 6 (value 74).

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 3],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to exactly one agent and each agent receives a fair distribution based on their preferences.
