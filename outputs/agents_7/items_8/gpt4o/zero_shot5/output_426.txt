Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70   7  80  22  71  52  57   1
1  97  41  65  19  84  46  49   0
2  10  96  82  73  51  58  72  34
3   8  65  70  97  27   5  67  50
4  66  87  37   1  34   5  60  12
5  21  12  63  23  22  46  80  41
6  61  61  75  50  34  12  37  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure an equitable distribution based on the given valuations. We will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest value for each item across all agents and assign the item to the corresponding agent.
2. If any agent ends up with no items, reallocate from agents with multiple items in a way that balances the distribution.

Based on the table provided:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 97 (highest).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 96 (highest).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 80 (highest).
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it at 97 (highest).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 84 (highest).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 58 (highest, after item 1 is chosen by agent 2).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 57 (highest, after item 2 is chosen by agent 0).
- Item 7: Agent 6 values it at 72 (highest).

After this preliminary allocation, ensure every agent has at least one item. If any agent is left out, redistribute items from agents with multiple items to achieve fairness.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item, except agents who have lesser or no top valuations. In this case, agent 4 and 5 have no items, but their highest valuations are not competitive against the other agents' top choices.
