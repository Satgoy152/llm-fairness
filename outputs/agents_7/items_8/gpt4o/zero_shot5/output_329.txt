Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  38  90  77  32  60  93  77
1  29  58  19  68  23  14  99  11
2  35  29  57  61  32  25  54  45
3  17  97  58   4  54  31  57  31
4  57   8  51  99  95   8  45  93
5  40  40  19  40  32  31  63  74
6   3  95  48  36  29  55  33  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use a method that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the total number of allocated items equals 8.

To achieve this, we can employ a greedy approach, where we assign items starting from the highest valuation and ensure that each agent receives at least one item by the end of the allocation process. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Identify the highest value for each agent and allocate those items first.
2. Continue assigning the remaining items based on the highest remaining valuations while ensuring all agents get at least one item.

Following this method, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 6 (highest valuation for agent 0).
- Agent 1 gets item 6 (initial highest valuation, but item 6 is already taken, so the next highest is item 1).
- Agent 2 gets item 2 (highest valuation for agent 2).
- Agent 3 gets item 1 (highest valuation for agent 3).
- Agent 4 gets item 3 (highest valuation for agent 4).
- Agent 5 gets item 7 (highest valuation for agent 5).
- Agent 6 gets item 1 (initial highest valuation, but item 1 is already taken, so the next highest is item 5).

Now, let's ensure that all items are distributed by checking which items are left and assigning them appropriately:

The items allocated so far are [6, 1, 2, 1, 3, 7, 5]. The only remaining item is 0.

Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 0, who has the highest remaining valuation for that item.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation meets the requirement that all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item.
