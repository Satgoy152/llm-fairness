Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  93  76  97  74  29  82  55
1  54  38  38  12   6  54  46  21
2  46  76  32  27  92  92  10  71
3  72  71   9  31  34  48  62  22
4  25  75   5  95  21  76  17  93
5  82  26  37  73  15  45   4  39
6  39  68  76  65  10  89  57   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple greedy approach, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. A reasonable approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:** For each item, find out which agent values it the most.
2. **Allocate items based on highest valuation:** Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Item 0:** Highest value is 82 by agent 5.
- **Item 1:** Highest value is 93 by agent 0.
- **Item 2:** Highest value is 76 by agent 0 and 2 (tie, choose one, e.g., agent 0).
- **Item 3:** Highest value is 97 by agent 0.
- **Item 4:** Highest value is 92 by agent 2.
- **Item 5:** Highest value is 92 by agent 2.
- **Item 6:** Highest value is 82 by agent 0.
- **Item 7:** Highest value is 93 by agent 4.

Based on the above allocation strategy, we can assign the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent, maximizing the total value received by all agents collectively.
