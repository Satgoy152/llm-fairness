Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  66   2  44   9  31  32  12
1  87   9  99  19  68  33  37  22
2  80   9  74  81  52  70  51  99
3   3  20  53  94  81  37  47  70
4  12  51  55  19  95  65   9  64
5  41  84  16  95  19  25  46  34
6  20  31  53  89  24  66  53  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible, given that there are 7 agents and 8 items.

Let's examine a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 highly (66).  
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 (99).  
3. **Agent 2** values item 7 highly (99).  
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 highly (94).  
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 highly (95).  
6. **Agent 5** values item 1 highly (84) but item 3 is already taken, so we'll consider another item.
7. **Agent 6** values item 5 highly (66).  

To distribute the items fairly, considering the above observations, we can do the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (66)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (99)
- Agent 2: Item 7 (99)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (94)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (95)
- Agent 5: Item 0 (41)
- Agent 6: Item 5 (66)

Each agent gets one item, with the exception of one agent who will receive two items since there are 8 items in total. Let's re-evaluate and adjust to allocate the remaining item:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 6 (66, 32) 

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated.
