Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  16  24  29  64  68  59  52
1   4  22  18  38  80  31  81  46
2  28  16  96   1  11   9  14  20
3  53  49  46  96  76  15  63  96
4   3  53  23  87  72  96  72  37
5  86  40  68  83  13  27  24  53
6  37   4  48  80  90  65  25  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we should consider both the valuations and the fairness of distribution. Given the 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items, and the rest will receive one item each.

A possible fair allocation strategy could be to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution:

1. Assign the highest valued item to each agent based on their unique preferences.
2. Ensure that no agent is significantly disadvantaged by the allocation.

Here's a feasible allocation of items:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly, so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly, so allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly, so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly, so allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly, so allocate item 1 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 0 highly, so allocate item 0 to Agent 5.
- Agent 6 values item 4 highly, so allocate item 4 to Agent 6.
- Assign the remaining item 7 to the agent who has the next highest overall valuation: Agent 3 (valued at 96).

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [4]
}
```
