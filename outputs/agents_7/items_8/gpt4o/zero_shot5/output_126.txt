Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  26  29  65  52  43  14  75
1  90  18  94  29  71  62  24  86
2  60   0  87  58   6  87  24  29
3  11  68  78   4  61  89  87  46
4  31  48  80  75  16  79  59  49
5  38  12   6  27  77   3  66  89
6  46  55   1   0  74  60  47  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider their valuations and distribute the items as evenly as possible. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the items each agent values the most to maximize individual satisfaction.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while considering their preferences.
3. Balance the allocation to ensure no agent is disproportionately advantaged or disadvantaged.

Following these guidelines, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the highest (75).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (94).
- Agent 2 values items 2 and 5 equally high (87), but item 2 is already taken, so item 5 is next.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (89), but item 5 is already taken, so item 6 is next.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (80), but item 2 is already taken, so item 3 is next.
- Agent 5 values item 7 the highest (89), but item 7 is already taken, so item 4 is next.
- Agent 6 values item 4 the highest (74), but item 4 is already taken, so item 1 is next.

Each agent will get at least one item, and all items will be allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [0, 1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent has been assigned items based on their highest valuations, with an attempt to allocate all items fairly across the agents.
