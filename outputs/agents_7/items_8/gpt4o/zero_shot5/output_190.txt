Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  63  94  27  21  75  42  48
1  59  28  58   2  39  29  17  31
2   1  99  52  64  90  56  42  99
3  51  95  87  46  67  30  85  61
4  50  52  69  19  20  11  86  11
5  11  73  14  91  63  33   9  96
6  78  79  76   9  86  59  79  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives approximately the same total value, while also ensuring that every item is allocated. Since there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items, while the others receive one item each.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent to guide our allocation:

- Agent 0: 77 + 63 + 94 + 27 + 21 + 75 + 42 + 48 = 447
- Agent 1: 59 + 28 + 58 + 2 + 39 + 29 + 17 + 31 = 263
- Agent 2: 1 + 99 + 52 + 64 + 90 + 56 + 42 + 99 = 503
- Agent 3: 51 + 95 + 87 + 46 + 67 + 30 + 85 + 61 = 522
- Agent 4: 50 + 52 + 69 + 19 + 20 + 11 + 86 + 11 = 318
- Agent 5: 11 + 73 + 14 + 91 + 63 + 33 + 9 + 96 = 390
- Agent 6: 78 + 79 + 76 + 9 + 86 + 59 + 79 + 50 = 516

Now, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign the item with the highest value for each agent to that agent, if not already taken.
2. Adjust the allocations to ensure each agent receives approximately equal value.

Let's allocate:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (94)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (59)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (99) and Item 7 (99)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (85)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (11)
- Agent 5: Item 3 (91)
- Agent 6: Item 4 (86)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations and ensures that all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [4]
}
```
