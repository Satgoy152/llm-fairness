Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  19  81  78  28  38   0   7
1   6  60  53  90   7  37  39  32
2  73  45  88   0  40  81  57  83
3  50  53  69  82  84  83  94  34
4  23  19  58   4  96   3   8  58
5  84  17  38  41  74  24  50  76
6  66  75  93  38   4  13  27   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, if possible. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation approach, considering the valuations:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as they have a high valuation of 81 for it.
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1, as they have a high valuation of 90 for it.
3. Assign item 6 to agent 3, as they have a high valuation of 94 for it.
4. Assign item 4 to agent 4, as they have a high valuation of 96 for it.
5. Assign item 0 to agent 5, as they have a high valuation of 84 for it.
6. Assign item 7 to agent 2, as they have a high valuation of 83 for it.
7. Assign item 1 to agent 6, as they have a high valuation of 75 for it.
8. Assign item 5 to agent 3, as they have a high valuation of 83 for it.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it highly, enhancing fairness and satisfaction.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6, 5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [1]
}
```
