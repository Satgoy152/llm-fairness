Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  44  48  42  33  59  62   8
1  26  28  68  37  93  42  96  11
2  18  18  28  83  48  52  19  47
3  19  62   1  10  42  75  45  45
4  56   1  47  39  43  24  47  60
5  21  36  83  73  99  91  59  92
6  11   6  74  30  99  94  69  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[41 44 48 42 33 59 62  8]
 [26 28 68 37 93 42 96 11]
 [18 18 28 83 48 52 19 47]
 [19 62  1 10 42 75 45 45]
 [56  1 47 39 43 24 47 60]
 [21 36 83 73 99 91 59 92]
 [11  6 74 30 99 94 69 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents by considering their valuations. Let's analyze the table and attempt to distribute the items equitably:

1. Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 7 (99), so we allocate item 7 to agent 6.
2. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 4 (99), so we allocate item 4 to agent 5.
3. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 6 (96), so we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
4. Agent 5 also has a high valuation for item 5 (91), so we allocate item 5 to agent 5.
5. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (83), so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 2 (83), but since agent 5 already has two items, we consider agent 6 for item 2, as they have the next highest valuation (74), so we allocate item 2 to agent 6.
7. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1 (62), so we allocate item 1 to agent 3.
8. Remaining item 0 is allocated to agent 4, who has a relatively high value for it (56).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4, 5],
    "6": [7, 2]
}
```
