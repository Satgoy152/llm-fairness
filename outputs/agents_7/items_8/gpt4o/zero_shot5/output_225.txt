Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  69  36  20  53  33  14  29
1  79  98  71  72  34  69  34  22
2  40  33  77  46  49   7  78  65
3  28  71  97  85  77  34  62  82
4  39  17  30  15  76  94  83  89
5  20  86  43  16  11  50  54  47
6  66  63  87  96  63  72  14  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, based on their preferences. This is a classic fair division problem, and one common approach is to use the "maximum weighted matching" approach or other similar optimization strategies. However, without optimization algorithms here, I'll attempt a simple heuristic approach by manually assigning items based on agent preferences for simplicity.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 1, since agent 1 values it the most (98).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 3, since agent 3 values it the most (97).
3. Assign item 3 to agent 6, since agent 6 values it the most (96).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 0, since agent 0 values it the most (53).
5. Assign item 5 to agent 4, since agent 4 values it the most (94).
6. Assign item 6 to agent 2, since agent 2 values it the most (78).
7. Assign item 7 to agent 4, since agent 4 values it the most (89).
8. Assign item 0 to agent 5, since agent 5 values it relatively high compared to their other values.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5, 7],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This allocation aims to give each agent at least one high-valued item based on their preferences, while ensuring that each item is allocated to only one agent.
