Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  39  41  25  35   2  43  26
1  62  63  83  69  11  45  86  23
2  82  71   6  77  18  31  94  28
3  54  53   1  37  97  40  83  27
4  13  62  89  72  61  38  64  15
5  75  95  13  59  88  21  64  38
6  98  77  65  77  33   5  64  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, a potential approach is to use a method that considers each agent's highest valuations and ensures that each agent receives a roughly equal share of their preferred items. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and that exactly 8 items are to be distributed, we can attempt to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate items starting with the agent who has the highest valuation for any single item.
3. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, and that no item is allocated more than once.

Following this strategy, we can perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most: Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most: Allocate item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most, which is already allocated. Next highest is item 3: Allocate item 3 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most: Allocate item 4 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most: Allocate item 2 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 1 the most: Allocate item 1 to agent 5.
- Agent 6 values item 0 the most, which is already allocated. Next highest is item 1, which is already allocated. Then item 3, which is already allocated. Next is item 2, which is already allocated. Then item 6, which is already allocated. Next is item 7: Allocate item 7 to agent 6.

Now, there is one item left (item 5), which can be allocated to the agent with the least total value from their current allocation. Agent 3 has the least total value so far, so item 5 is allocated to agent 3.

The allocations can be presented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item where possible and maximizes fairness based on the given valuations.
