Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71   6   9  86  12  87  17  40
1  40  41  65   9  33   8  50  49
2  18  49  38  26  70  48  99  59
3  76  27  22  83  74  15  17  92
4  23  27  11  24  81  93  93  87
5  63  16  17  76  39  62  87  86
6  42  78  59  52  58  15  44  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. The goal is to achieve a balanced allocation by considering each agent's highest valuations first and ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's a potential allocation based on the valuations provided:

- Agent 0: Highest valuations are for items 3 and 5.
- Agent 1: Highest valuations are for items 2 and 6.
- Agent 2: Highest valuations are for items 6 and 4.
- Agent 3: Highest valuations are for items 7 and 0.
- Agent 4: Highest valuations are for items 5 and 4.
- Agent 5: Highest valuations are for items 7 and 6.
- Agent 6: Highest valuations are for items 1 and 4.

Considering these and ensuring each item is allocated once, a fair allocation could be:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one of their highest valued items while ensuring all items are distributed. Agent 6 receives two items to ensure all 8 items are allocated.
