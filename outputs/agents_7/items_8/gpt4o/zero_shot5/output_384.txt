Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  57  17  70  33   1  56  33
1  99  88  69  57  41  38  39  10
2  61  95  12  40  72  81  94  77
3  79  93  60  44  31  89  33  22
4  28  56  83   0  32  83  95  51
5  26  15   6   3  27  54  63  10
6  27  80  53   1  54  74  80  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 3 (Value: 70)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 0 (Value: 99) and Item 2 (Value: 69)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 5 (Value: 81)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 1 (Value: 93)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 6 (Value: 95)
6. **Agent 5**: No items
7. **Agent 6**: Item 7 (Value: 82) and Item 4 (Value: 54)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and tries to maximize the total value for each agent. Now, let's format this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [],
    "6": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of the total available value.
