Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  22  21  76  26  16  60  15
1  17  77  40  18  74  28  58   4
2  90  89  67  41  11  33  28  78
3  73  19  41  63  27  16  42  52
4  12   7  31  44  56  31  58  65
5  45   6  29   1  91  63  78  28
6  39  42  94   1  37  39  82  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Given that there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive 2 items and the others will receive 1 item each. The goal is to allocate items such that the sum of valuations of assigned items is as balanced as possible among agents.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (value 76)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (value 77)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (value 90) and Item 2 (value 67)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (value 52)
- Agent 4: Item 6 (value 58)
- Agent 5: Item 4 (value 91)
- Agent 6: Item 5 (value 39)

This allocation ensures that:

- Each agent receives at least one item.
- One agent, in this case agent 2, receives two items.
- The total number of items allocated is 8.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [5]
}
```
