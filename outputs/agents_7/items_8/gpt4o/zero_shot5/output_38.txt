Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62   6  24  77  66  22  87  58
1  99  21  62  42  39  82  42  73
2  61  94  73  25  50  72  49   8
3  12  34   2  77  12  45  69  76
4  22  57  18  31  61  18  53  51
5  26  84  44  49  68  53  21  11
6  10  43  84  68  32   7  54  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [10 43 84 68 32  7 54 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple greedy approach. This involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can do it:

1. Create a list of items, each with its respective valuations by the agents.
2. Sort these items based on the maximum valuation for each item.
3. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 1 (99)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 2 (94)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 6 (84)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 0 and Agent 3 (77). Assign to Agent 0 for balance.
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 0 (66)
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 1 (82)
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (87)
- Item 7: Highest value by Agent 3 (76)

Now, we will distribute these items to the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most while also ensuring a fair distribution of items among the agents.
