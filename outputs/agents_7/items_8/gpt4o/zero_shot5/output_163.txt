Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  89  25  66  24  65  89  49
1  98  89  14  37  82  26  92  31
2  18  65   3  53   5  18  54  69
3  66  72  41  85  19  74  24  15
4  79  41  56   2  64   4  96  98
5  95  56  95  80  66  87  66  72
6   1   7  71   0  90  85  28  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[88 89 25 66 24 65 89 49]
 [98 89 14 37 82 26 92 31]
 [18 65  3 53  5 18 54 69]
 [66 72 41 85 19 74 24 15]
 [79 41 56  2 64  4 96 98]
 [95 56 95 80 66 87 66 72]
 [ 1  7 71  0 90 85 28 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we will try to distribute them in such a way that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, since there are 7 agents and 8 items. This is a classic fair division problem, and one possible approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns items based on each agent's highest valuation that hasn't been assigned yet.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (value = 89).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value = 98).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (value = 69).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (value = 85).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 7, but it's taken, so next is item 6 (value = 96).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 0, but it's taken, next is item 2 (value = 95).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (value = 90).

Now, we have assigned 7 items, one to each agent. We have one more item (item 5) to allocate. Reviewing the remaining options:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest value is item 5 (value = 65).
- **Agent 1**: Next highest value is item 5 (value = 26).
- **Agent 2**: Next highest value is item 5 (value = 18).
- **Agent 3**: Next highest value is item 5 (value = 74).
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 6, next highest is item 5, but let's distribute fairly.
- **Agent 5**: Next highest value is item 5 (value = 87).
- **Agent 6**: Next highest value is item 5 (value = 85).

Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 5 among those who haven't been assigned it yet, so we will assign item 5 to Agent 5.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2, 5],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent is allocated at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated.
