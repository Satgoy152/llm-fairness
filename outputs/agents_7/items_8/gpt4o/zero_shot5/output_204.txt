Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  60  87  68  33  93  60  72
1  48  53  60  97  63  82   4  39
2  81  47  74  67  89  98  72  66
3  97  76  23  65  90  30  91  49
4  12  42  67  73  95  97   2  54
5  25  86  10  65  76  45  82  67
6  64   0  67  13  99  94  55  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we should consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive 2 items and the rest will receive 1 item each.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Allocate items based on the highest value for each agent, ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent.
2. If there are conflicts (an item is equally valued by more than one agent), choose the assignment that balances the overall allocation.
3. Ensure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

After evaluating the table, here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets item 5 (value 93).
- Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 97).
- Agent 2 gets item 4 (value 89).
- Agent 3 gets item 0 (value 97).
- Agent 4 gets item 6 (value 2).
- Agent 5 gets item 1 (value 86).
- Agent 6 gets items 7 and 2 (values 31 and 67).

Allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [7, 2]
}
```
