Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  61  26  60  42  20   9  69
1  99  77  20  54  65  64  47  52
2  21  70  73  31  36  51  24  64
3  30   9  35  67  16  80   6   6
4  66  34  77  71  94  73  66  87
5  60  34   7  21  67  58  95  44
6  44  63  55  48  68  20  31  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [99 77 20 54 65 64 47 52]

 [44 63 55 48 68 20 31 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are more agents than items, some agents will not receive any items. The goal is to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (total valuation) is maximized.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0, with a value of 99.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 7, with a value of 69.
3. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 4, with a value of 94.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 5, with a value of 80.
5. **Agent 4** also has the highest valuation for item 2, with a value of 77.
6. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 3, with a value of 71.
7. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 1, with a value of 77.
8. **Agent 6** has a high valuation for item 7, with a value of 82.

Given these observations, here is a possible allocation:
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 5 (to ensure every item is allocated and agent 5 has a reasonable valuation here).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 3, 4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": []
}
```
