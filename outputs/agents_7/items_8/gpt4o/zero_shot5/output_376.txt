Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25   3  80  43  35  74  45  72
1  19  51  22  61  88  78  25   5
2  88  88  34  29  40  92  22  12
3   3  20  81  15  57  90  29  57
4  46  38  54  32  77  28  92  67
5  41  77  15  98  24  75  32  49
6  21  83  45  72   9  88   6  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives according to their preferences. The goal is to distribute the 8 items among the 7 agents as evenly as possible, ensuring that each agent's preferences are considered.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** For each item, identify which agent values it the most.
2. **Allocate Items:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Since there are more items than agents, some agents will receive more than one item. Ensure that the additional items go to agents who value them highly, without leaving any agent without an item.

Here's how the allocation might look:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most (88).
- **Item 1**: Agent 6 values it the most (83).
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (80).
- **Item 3**: Agent 5 values it the most (98).
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most (88).
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most (92), but since Agent 2 already has item 0, give it to the next highest, Agent 3 (90).
- **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the most (92).
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it highly (72), and since Agent 0 only has one item, they receive this one too.

Now, let's allocate these items to the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent gets at least one item, except for the necessary condition where one agent must receive none due to the 7 agents and 8 items constraint. In this specific allocation, each agent has been given consideration for their highest valued items.
