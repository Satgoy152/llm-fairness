Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  92  40  87  88  28  85  81
1  41   3  56  45  24  38   3  22
2  35  80  67  47  76  68  84  21
3  63  22   0   7   7  99  21  13
4  50  24  33  75  75  50  16  54
5  49  88  77  91  75  79  42  63
6  40  36  42  76  65  12  84  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction according to the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items while the others receive one item.

Let's assign items to agents by considering their highest valuations first:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 1 (92).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 2 (56).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 6 (84).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 5 (99).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 3 (75).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 3 (91), which is already taken. Next highest is item 1 (88).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value is for item 2 (42), which is already taken. Next highest is item 6 (84), which is also taken. Next highest is item 3 (76), which is already taken. Next highest is item 4 (65).

Now, let's allocate an additional item to one of the agents to ensure all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 1, next highest available is item 0 (53).
  
Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item (except one agent who receives none), all items are distributed, and the allocation attempts to maximize satisfaction based on the given valuations.
