Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  48  51  43  37   5  54  18
1  59  34  87  22  45  80  23  55
2  95  88  24  97  48  99  92  89
3  63  93  34  55  39  83  95  41
4  23  34  45   9  56  22  55  20
5  69  94  75  11  64  73  17  99
6  60  90  49   6  85  97  61  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value of the items each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and exactly 8 items are allocated in total.

Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:**
   - We will start by identifying which items each agent values the most.
   - Our goal is to assign items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction based on the agents' valuations.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - We aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share of items they value highly.
   - This can be done by checking the highest available valuations and assigning those items to the respective agent.

3. **Ensure Fair Allocation:**
   - Ensure each agent receives at least one item, considering the highest values they have assigned to the items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Agent 0: Values item 0 the most with a value of 58.
- Agent 1: Values item 2 the most with a value of 87.
- Agent 2: Values item 5 the most with a value of 99.
- Agent 3: Values item 6 the most with a value of 95.
- Agent 4: Values item 4 the most with a value of 56.
- Agent 5: Values item 7 the most with a value of 99.
- Agent 6: Values item 1 the most with a value of 90.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the items are allocated based on the highest valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [1]
}
```

Note: The total number of items allocated is exactly 7. Since there are 8 items to be allocated, I will need to adjust the allocation slightly to ensure all 8 items are distributed. Let's give the remaining item (3) to the agent who values it second highest. Agent 3 values item 3 with 55, which is the highest among remaining allocations:

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [1]
}
```
