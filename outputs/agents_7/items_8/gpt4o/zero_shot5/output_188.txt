Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  40  64  10  52  95  54  52
1  86  78  42  35  66  40  87  21
2   4  30  74  21  21  40  82  36
3  33  87  66  91  65  75  29  32
4  17  62  58  53  20  40  22  81
5  25  33  49   8  97  70  54  82
6   4   3  33  75   4  72  95  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, we can implement a simple strategy. We'll allocate the items to the agent who values them the most.

Here's the allocation process:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 86 (Agent 1)
2. Item 1: Highest value is 87 (Agent 3)
3. Item 2: Highest value is 74 (Agent 2)
4. Item 3: Highest value is 91 (Agent 3)
5. Item 4: Highest value is 97 (Agent 5)
6. Item 5: Highest value is 95 (Agent 0)
7. Item 6: Highest value is 95 (Agent 6)
8. Item 7: Highest value is 82 (Agent 5)

Based on the above allocations, the distribution of items to agents is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4, 7],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents based on their highest valuations.
