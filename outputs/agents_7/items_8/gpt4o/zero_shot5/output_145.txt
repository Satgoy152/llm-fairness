Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  37  31  37  50  10  51   8
1  42  24  42  26  14  26  54  23
2  40  24  70  39  25   6  57   9
3   7   4   2  29  38  20  61  79
4  87  53   1  28  56  89  83  78
5   8   5  86  81  26  52  38  67
6  37   6  49  46  47  32   5  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally receive one item, and one agent will receive two items.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value of each agent if they receive their highest valued item.
2. Allocate the highest valued item to each agent, ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent.
3. Allocate the remaining item to the agent who would benefit the most in terms of total value.

Here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 6 (Value: 51)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (Value: 42)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (already allocated to Agent 1, choose next highest) -> Item 6 (already allocated, choose next highest) -> Item 0 (Value: 40)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (Value: 79)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (Value: 89)
- Agent 5: Item 3 (Value: 81)
- Agent 6: Item 4 (Value: 47)
- Allocate remaining item 1 to Agent 0 (Value: 37)

Let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.
