Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75   7  88  15  92  53  15  85
1  77  44  57  36   6   9  32  51
2  61  84  12  62  74  50  99  70
3  79  69  33   1  42  37   4  93
4  68  95  59  31  24  91  65   6
5  71  47  17  38  62  34  10  25
6  36  60  78  61  77  38  58  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations. However, we must ensure that each agent gets at least one item and no items are left unallocated. We'll also ensure that no agent gets more than one item before every agent has at least one.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. First, assign each agent their most valued item that hasn't been taken yet.
2. Then, for the remaining items, assign them to the agent who values them the highest, ensuring that no agent receives more than two items until all agents have had the opportunity to receive a second item.

Following this approach, the allocation could look like this:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (value 92), so assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (value 77), so assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (value 99), so assign item 6 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 7 the highest (value 93), so assign item 7 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (value 95), so assign item 1 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 5 the highest (value 34), so assign item 5 to agent 5.
- Agent 6 values item 2 the highest (value 78), so assign item 2 to agent 6.

At this point, every agent has one item, and there is one item (item 3) left. We can assign the remaining item based on the highest remaining valuation:

- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (value 62), so assign item 3 to agent 2.

Now, the allocations are complete, and every item is allocated.

The allocations in the requested JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2]
}
```
