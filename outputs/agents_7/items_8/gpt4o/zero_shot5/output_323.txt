Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  72  20  17  44  56  42  35
1  60  13  67  75   8  52  62  57
2  12  73  61  25  67  74  41   1
3  79  47  10  94   7  11  71  85
4  79  93  68  16  54  14  60   0
5  34  77  22  74  50  52  19  76
6   1  48  61  70  36  91  93  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. We should aim to assign the items in a way that maximizes the total valuations, but given the constraint of fairness, each agent should ideally receive at least one item if possible. Here's a suggestion for the allocation:

1. Agent 0: Items [0, 1] - Values: 62, 72
2. Agent 1: Item [3] - Value: 75
3. Agent 2: Item [5] - Value: 74
4. Agent 3: Item [7] - Value: 85
5. Agent 4: Item [4] - Value: 54
6. Agent 5: Item [6] - Value: 19
7. Agent 6: Item [2] - Value: 61

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2]
}
```
