Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  75  99  92  60  40   5   5
1  15  27   3   1  46  25  47  68
2  25  85  62  19  97  19  97  47
3  38  51  63  85  29  30  35  40
4  65  80  14  97  97  75  63  19
5  77  35  22  45  18   0  79  95
6  44  30  11  84  99  18  56  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given the valuations matrix, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 2, so assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 7, so assign item 7 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4, so assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 3, so assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 3, but it has been allocated to agent 3. The next highest value is item 1, so assign item 1 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 7, but it has been allocated to agent 1. The next highest value is item 0, so assign item 0 to agent 5.
7. **Agent 6** highly values item 4, but it has been allocated to agent 2. The next highest value is item 4, but it is also taken, so assign item 6 to agent 6.

Now we need to ensure all items are allocated. The remaining items are 5. Let's assign them based on the remaining highest values:
- **Item 5**: Agent 4 values item 5 the highest among remaining options, so assign item 5 to agent 4.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 5],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6]
}
```
