Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  51  35  33  15  81  98  65
1   8  43  82   0  99  13  12  30
2  28  50  52  19  88  61   1  54
3  12  40  65  56  37  45  66  89
4  14  40  86  19  25  74   1  84
5  91   3  85   5  80  66   9  70
6  15  59  26   4   1  46  74  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction and attempts to balance the total value of items each agent receives. Given each agent should receive an integer number of items, and there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items, and the others will receive one item each.

Here's a possible allocation approach based on maximizing each agent's highest value:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 6 (value 98).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 4 (value 99).
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 4 (value 88), but since it's already taken, we consider the next highest, item 2 (value 52).
4. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 7 (value 89).
5. Agent 4 has the highest value for item 2 (value 86), but since it's already taken, we consider the next highest, item 5 (value 74).
6. Agent 5 has the highest value for item 0 (value 91).
7. Agent 6 has the highest value for item 6 (value 74), but since it's already taken, we consider the next highest, item 1 (value 59).

Now we allocate the remaining item:

- Item 3 has not been allocated yet. Agent 3 can take this as it provides a good value of 56 for them.

This allocation results in each agent receiving one item, except for Agent 3, who receives two items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7, 3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [1]
}
```
