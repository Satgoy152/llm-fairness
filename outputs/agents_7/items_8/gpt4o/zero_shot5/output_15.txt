Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  26  27  40  29  37  54  86
1  40  19   8  45  52  89   8  94
2  91  90  47  25  59  70  81  32
3  12  47  31  74  64  31  89  44
4  72  80  81  17   0  84  68  46
5  26   6  91  51  93  34   8  29
6  22  19  69  85  61  99  87  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. One approach is to assign each agent the items where they have the highest valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Given the valuations, here's a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for item 6 and item 7.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 3.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 2.
6. Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 4.
7. Agent 6 has a high valuation for item 1.

Using this information, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: [4]
- Agent 6: [1, 7]

Thus, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [1, 7]
}
```
