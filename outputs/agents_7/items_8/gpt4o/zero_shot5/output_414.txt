Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  21  78  88  18  29  12   8
1   4  87   8  13  18   6  47  46
2  43   9  55  40  16  56  29  80
3   8  85  11  15  86   3  81  97
4   2  46  16  87  73   7  42  68
5  61  12  20  55  43   3  34  92
6   0  16  10  23  31   8  89  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. One way to achieve this is by assigning the items based on the highest valuations for each agent without exceeding the total number of items available.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning the highest-valued item for each agent.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and exactly 8 items are assigned in total.

Let's proceed step by step:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (88).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (87).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 7 (80).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 7 (97) but since this item is allocated to agent 2, let's choose the next highest, item 6 (81).
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 3 (87) but since this item is allocated to agent 0, let's choose the next highest, item 4 (73).
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 0 (61).
- Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 6 (89) but since this item is allocated to agent 3, let's choose the next highest, item 4 (31) but since this item is already allocated to agent 4, let's choose item 7 (28).

After ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and allocating exactly 8 items, here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and a total of 8 items are distributed across the agents.
