Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81   0  34  70  28  80  47  84
1  58  37  42  11   6  64  61  27
2   1  31  54  56  24  38  86  37
3  88   3  90  38  77  91  59  69
4  56  31  31  24   9  19  21  23
5  23  94  13  36  70  29  39  92
6  15   3  16  86  83  81  30  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated in total. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Assign item 7 (value = 84) and item 5 (value = 80) to Agent 0 as they have relatively high valuations for these items.
2. **Agent 1:** Assign item 2 (value = 42) to Agent 1, as it is one of the higher valuations for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Assign item 6 (value = 86) to Agent 2, as it is the highest valuation for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Assign item 3 (value = 38) to Agent 3, as it is one of the items with a high valuation for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Assign item 0 (value = 56) to Agent 4, as it is the highest valuation for Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5:** Assign item 1 (value = 94) to Agent 5, as it is the highest valuation for Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6:** Assign item 4 (value = 83) to Agent 6, as it is one of the highest valuations for Agent 6.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly while all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items among the 7 agents, ensuring each item is allocated to the agent that values it relatively highly.
