Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  86  13  68  68  31  89  11
1  18  12  38  42  74  80   7  10
2  11  56  54  76  64  99  18  80
3  66  72  89  32  29  43  17  97
4  13  69  22  40  75  24  96  84
5  27  37  21  11  79  34  63  28
6  47  46  89  32  56  86  17  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Given that there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, while the others will receive 1 item each.

We'll consider the preferences of each agent for the items based on their valuations and attempt to distribute the items accordingly.

Here's one potential allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 6. Assign item 6 (value 89) to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has high valuation for item 5. Assign item 5 (value 80) to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has high valuation for item 5, but it's already taken. The next best is item 3. Assign item 3 (value 76) to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 has high valuation for item 2. Assign item 2 (value 89) to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 has high valuation for item 6, but it's already taken. The next best is item 4. Assign item 4 (value 75) to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 has high valuation for item 4, but it's already taken. The next best is item 0. Assign item 0 (value 27) to Agent 5.
- Agent 6 has high valuation for item 2, but it's already taken, and item 6, which is also taken. The next best is item 1. Assign item 1 (value 46) to Agent 6.

Now, one item remains unallocated, which is item 7. We need to assign it to one of the agents who already has an item, based on maximizing their total value.

- Agent 0 has item 6 (value 89) and values item 7 at 11, making the total 100.
- Agent 1 has item 5 (value 80) and values item 7 at 10, making the total 90.
- Agent 2 has item 3 (value 76) and values item 7 at 80, making the total 156.
- Agent 3 has item 2 (value 89) and values item 7 at 97, making the total 186.
- Agent 4 has item 4 (value 75) and values item 7 at 84, making the total 159.
- Agent 5 has item 0 (value 27) and values item 7 at 28, making the total 55.
- Agent 6 has item 1 (value 46) and values item 7 at 34, making the total 80.

Assign item 7 to Agent 3, who maximizes the total value with 186.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [1]
}
```
