Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59   2  68  38  10  42  41  20
1  91   8  79  15  81  55  99  75
2  93  70  17  73   5  35  33  57
3  19  64  28  11  73  19  53  45
4  78  50  79  30  24  86  96  92
5  29   4  61  77  46  66  81  33
6  62  47  98  15  64  31  26   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Given the constraints and the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high valuations for items 0 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** values items 6 and 0 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values items 0 and 3 highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the most.
5. **Agent 4** values items 6 and 7 highly.
6. **Agent 5** values items 5 and 6 highly.
7. **Agent 6** values item 2 highly.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 6 (highest value for item 2).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value for item 6).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value for item 0, after item 6 is assigned).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (next highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (next highest value for Agent 4, after item 6).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest value for item 4).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 5 (highest value for item 5).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (only item left, and Agent 0 has space).

Now, the allocation can be represented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
