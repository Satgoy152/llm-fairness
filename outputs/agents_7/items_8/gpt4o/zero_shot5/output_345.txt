Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  70  55  85  96  58  20  67
1  12  73   4  86  25  18  79  80
2  31  83  25  85  28  71  27   4
3  26  32  25  15   3  79  55  82
4  80  53  74  81   7  54  17  86
5  74  53  78  56  12  47   2  30
6  57  90   0  97  35  25  14  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we can consider a strategy that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. A common approach is to assign items to agents in a way that maximizes the minimum value received by any agent, or to allocate items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. Here, we'll attempt a simple allocation by distributing items to maximize each agent's personal value, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the most (96). Assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most (86). Assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the most (83). Assign item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most (79). Assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 the most (86). Assign item 7 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 2 the most (78). Assign item 2 to agent 5.
7. Agent 6 values item 6 the most (14). Assign item 6 to agent 6.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Item 0 is unallocated. Since agent 0 is the only one without a second item, we assign item 0 to agent 0.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [6]
}
```

Each item has been allocated, and each agent receives a fair allocation based on their highest personal valuations for the items they received.
