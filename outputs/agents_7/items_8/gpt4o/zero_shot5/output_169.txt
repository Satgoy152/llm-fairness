Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  34  30   0  99  95  90  28
1  34  70   2  81  92  31  17   1
2  89  52  61  44  80  40  22  24
3  83  39   7  65  56  37  68  53
4  39  24   4  38  19  51  99  29
5  16  85  38  49  95   9  19  51
6  80  80  26  70  13  47  25  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach. One common method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each item is allocated to an agent who highly values it, which can be considered fair in terms of maximizing individual satisfaction. We will iterate through each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

Here are the steps for allocation:

1. For each item, find the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Assign that item to the identified agent.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, considering there are more items than agents.
4. Present the final allocation in the required JSON format.

Following these steps, here is the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 89.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 70.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 61.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 81.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 99.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 95.
- Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 99.
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most with a value of 53.

Now, we will present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, thus achieving a fair distribution based on the given criteria.
