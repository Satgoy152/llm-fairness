Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  47  21  12  25  65  47  94
1  47  10  87  25  72  76   5   9
2  10   5  58  11  77  51   1  50
3  34   2  66  52  13  36  50  50
4  64  81  97  55  71  59  55   4
5  98  90  81  95  95  64  67  55
6  27  56  66  75   2  83  53  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to assign items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 5**: Has the highest valuation for item 0, so we assign item 0 to Agent 5.
2. **Agent 4**: Has the highest valuation for items 1 and 2, so we assign these to Agent 4.
3. **Agent 6**: Has the highest valuation for item 5, so we assign item 5 to Agent 6.
4. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 2 (but already assigned), but also values item 4 highly, so we assign item 4 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for items 6 and 7, so we assign these to Agent 3.
6. **Agent 2**: Left with items 3 and 4 (but item 4 is assigned), values item 3 moderately, so we assign item 3 to Agent 2.
7. **Agent 0**: Finally, Agent 0 does not have any items with the highest valuation, so we assign the least valued remaining item to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [5]
}
```

In this allocation, every item is assigned to one of the agents, and all agents are included in the JSON format output, even those with no items.
