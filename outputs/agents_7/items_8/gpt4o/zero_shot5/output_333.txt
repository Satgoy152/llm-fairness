Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9   4  47  39  57  22   8  13
1   6  77  66  82  45   5  25   6
2  67  82  10  44  99  29  51  55
3  66  45  69  91  41  53  66  74
4  56  21  74  76  48  63  35  98
5  14  71  22  13  27  52  20  12
6  44  65  89  89  98  55  68  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that attempts to maximize the agents' total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

One possible way to proceed is by considering the highest valuations first and trying to distribute the items such that each agent gets roughly one item (since there are 7 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more than one item).

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest unallocated value for each item and assign that item to the respective agent.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item; ideally, agents receive items that maximize their total valuation.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (47)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (82), Item 1 (77)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (99)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (74)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (63)
- Agent 5: Item 0 (14)
- Agent 6: Item 6 (68)

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to one agent, and agents receive the items with the highest valuations for those items.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items among the 7 agents, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and items are allocated based on the highest valuations.
