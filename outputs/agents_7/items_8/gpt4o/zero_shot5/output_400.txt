Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  78  26  58  35  31  27  83
1  29  39   8  51   4  13  65  13
2  58  25  57  70  46  10  31  54
3  25  33  32  16  31  68  80  66
4  37   2  45  58  93  76  60  59
5  53  45  14  78   4  25  57  28
6  30  96  17  44  61  76  54  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 7 agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated. We can try to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's valuations of the items they receive, while ensuring every agent receives at least some portion of the total value available.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 7, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 6.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 5.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.
- Agent 5 gets item 0.
- Agent 6 does not get any items as there are only 8 items and 7 agents, and this allocation is determined by maximizing total valuations across agents.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": []
}
```
luations.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuation for each item and attempts to distribute them fairly among the agents.
