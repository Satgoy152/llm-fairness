Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91   4  39  65  37   3   6  92
1  72  70   2  99  91  18  88   4
2  55  46  63  47  31  95  76  92
3  67  52  53  93  83  87  87  43
4   4  85   0  23  46  25  33  28
5   2  78  58  29  99   6  26  16
6   4  10  49  38  90  56  56  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to balance the total value each agent receives. This process involves assigning items to agents such that their total valuation is as balanced as possible while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:  Items 0 and 7, Total Value = 91 + 92 = 183
2. **Agent 1**:  Item 3, Total Value = 99
3. **Agent 2**:  Item 5, Total Value = 95
4. **Agent 3**:  Item 6, Total Value = 87
5. **Agent 4**:  Item 1, Total Value = 85
6. **Agent 5**:  Item 4, Total Value = 99
7. **Agent 6**:  Item 2, Total Value = 49

The allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, considering the objective to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, and every agent receives a fair amount based on their valuations.
