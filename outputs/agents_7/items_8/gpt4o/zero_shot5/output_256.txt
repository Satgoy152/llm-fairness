Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28   5  95  11  92  58  37  31
1  41  65  79  25  98  57  99  21
2  97   6  12  46  31  49  39  85
3  80  31   6  49  99  27  17  34
4  24  45  85  25  25  91  15  51
5  83  25  89  35  43  21  30  31
6  85  27  80  61  81  14  80  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, one common approach is to use a method such as the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) allocation. This approach aims to maximize the product of the utilities (valuations) of each agent, ensuring a fair distribution.

Given the valuations, we'll try to allocate the items such that each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is as fair as possible. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, while the others will receive 1 item each.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 2 (value = 95)
2. Agent 1: Item 4 (value = 98)
3. Agent 2: Item 0 (value = 97)
4. Agent 3: Item 3 (value = 49)
5. Agent 4: Item 5 (value = 91)
6. Agent 5: Items 1 and 7 (values = 25 and 31)
7. Agent 6: Item 6 (value = 80)

This allocation ensures that:
- Each agent receives at least one item.
- The total number of items distributed is 8.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1, 7],
    "6": [6]
}
```
