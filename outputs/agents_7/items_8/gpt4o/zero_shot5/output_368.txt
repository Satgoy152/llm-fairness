Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16   6  46  27  22  69  43  28
1  36  90   6  72  26  52  62  84
2  91   5  38  11  15  25  12  60
3  25  30  30  67  88  35  71  85
4  31  94   9  71  82  94  85  94
5  39  41  73  78  46  89  55   4
6   2  13   1  82  84  23  34   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly distribute the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated. The goal is to maximize the total value for all agents while maintaining fairness. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: Allocated items - [5] (Value = 69)
2. Agent 1: Allocated items - [1, 3] (Values = 90, 72)
3. Agent 2: Allocated items - [2, 7] (Values = 38, 60)
4. Agent 3: Allocated items - [4] (Value = 88)
5. Agent 4: Allocated items - [6] (Value = 85)
6. Agent 5: Allocated items - [0] (Value = 39)
7. Agent 6: Allocated items - [] (No items allocated)

With these allocations, each agent gets items that maximize their valuation of those items while ensuring all 8 items are distributed among the 7 agents.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0],
    "6": []
}
```
