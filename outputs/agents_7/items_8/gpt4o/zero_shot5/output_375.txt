Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86   5  94  48  83  64  18  44
1  53  94  25  98  90  22  80  41
2  53  39  45  33  47  95  80  30
3  17  97  20   4  55   9  49  34
4  21  54  77  54  94  94  21   0
5  38  71  56  72  64  11  31  42
6  44   8  96   9  69  70  50  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that every item is allocated.

One approach is to allocate items based on each agent's highest valuations, ensuring that no agent receives more than one item until all agents have received one. If any items remain, they can be allocated to agents based on their next highest valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 2. We can allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 3. We can allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5. We can allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 1, but it's already taken; item 3 is next. We can allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 4. We can allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 3, but it's taken; item 1 is next, but it's taken; item 5 is next, but it's taken. Item 6 is available. We can allocate item 6 to Agent 5.
7. Agent 6 has a high valuation for item 2, but it's taken; item 6 is taken, and so item 0 is the next choice. We can allocate item 0 to Agent 6.

After the above allocations, items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are allocated. Item 7 remains unallocated.

Item 7 can be allocated to Agent 3, who still has room, as it provides them with an additional value.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0]
}
```
