Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  73  71  48  63  29  81   5
1   5  35  38  77  50  30  15  48
2  42  53  46  76  92  47  16  58
3  19  23  20  74  69  83  76  16
4  11  53  74  77  21  82  86  36
5  27  69  23  78  10  52  89  47
6   5  49  81  41  51  90  95  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one item each.

First, we will identify the highest value item for each agent and assign it to them. Then, we will allocate the remaining item to the agent who would benefit most from it. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 6 (value = 81).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 3 (value = 77).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 4 (value = 92).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 5 (value = 83).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 6 (value = 86), but it's already assigned. The next highest is item 3, but it's also assigned. Thus, we allocate item 2 (value = 74).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for Agent 5 is item 6 (value = 89), but it's already assigned. We allocate item 3 (value = 78), but it's also assigned. Thus, we allocate item 1 (value = 69).
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value for Agent 6 is item 6 (value = 95), but it's already assigned. We allocate item 5 (value = 90).

Now, one item (item 0) is still unallocated. We will assign this to the agent who has the next highest interest in it. Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 0 (value = 42).

Let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, with Agent 2 receiving two items due to the additional unallocated item.
