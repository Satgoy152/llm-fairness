Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  91  19   0  23  45  46  16
1  39  56  25  27  20  91  67  16
2  45  81  15  35  31  98  46  92
3  69  49  44  42  34   4  68  30
4  23  97  93  15  35  12  90  51
5  75  54  62  92   8  19  53  43
6  59  12  67  79  49  99  40  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will end up with two items, while the rest will have one item each. The goal is to allocate these items fairly, possibly maximizing the valuation for each agent or distributing the items in a balanced manner based on their preferences. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Identify the highest value item for each agent and allocate that item to the agent if it's not already taken.
2. If an item is already allocated, find the next best available option for the agent with the highest preference for that item.
3. Allocate the remaining items to ensure that each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation based on the valuations provided:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, with agent 6 receiving two items due to the need to allocate all 8 items. The distribution is made by considering the highest available valuations for each agent.
