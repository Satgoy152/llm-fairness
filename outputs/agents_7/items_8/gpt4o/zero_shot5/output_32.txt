Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  31  58  86   4  83   2  11
1  39  91  19  65  14  77  68  88
2  65   9  60  52  44  75  16  81
3   4   4  37  12  12  67  30  64
4  60  38  49  16  59  45  98  96
5  83  38   7  19  47  92  57  49
6  26  12  23   1  92   3  98  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [39 91 19 65 14 77 68 88]

 [26 12 23  1 92  3 98 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's consider a simple allocation strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We will assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 5 values it the most at 83.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 58.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 6 values it the most at 92.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most at 83.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the most at 98.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 4 values it the most at 96.

Now, we will organize these allocations into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [6, 7],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, providing a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
