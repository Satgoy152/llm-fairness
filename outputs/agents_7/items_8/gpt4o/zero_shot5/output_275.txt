Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  85  47  87  87  77  59  43
1  80   5  56  20  32   1  52  55
2  79  23  45  84  71   0  84  14
3  27   5  32  53  39  87  24  55
4  65  70  42  66  29  13  29   1
5  81   5  24  32  31  82  54  96
6  88   7   3  64  13  47  24  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to balance the total valuation each agent receives. We'll aim for each agent to get roughly the same total value of items based on their individual preferences. Given there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items while others will receive one.

Let's consider the valuations and decide on the allocations:

1. Agent 0 seems to value items 1 and 3 very highly.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest.
3. Agent 2 values items 3 and 6 the highest.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 highly.
6. Agent 5 values item 7 the highest.
7. Agent 6 values item 0 the highest.

Using these observations, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to agent 4.
- Assign item 7 to agent 5.
- Assign items 2 and 6 to agent 6 (since agent 6 gets the remaining items).

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures every agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.
