Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  50  85  43  64  72  63  13
1  19  24  65   7  43  44  56  53
2  20  31  39  78  79  55  11   9
3  65  73  25  75  15   4  54  57
4  17  41  64   8  65  40  16  85
5  86  26  17  37  70  28  15  39
6  18  47  32  65  19  42  85  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a strategy where we try to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items that they value the most. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Ensure the total number of items assigned equals the number of items available.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Agent 0 gets item 2, as they value it at 85, which is the highest for this agent.
- Agent 1 gets item 6, as they value it at 56, which is the highest for this agent.
- Agent 2 gets item 4, as they value it at 79, which is the highest for this agent.
- Agent 3 gets item 1, as they value it at 73, which is the highest for this agent.
- Agent 4 gets item 7, as they value it at 85, which is the highest for this agent.
- Agent 5 gets item 0, as they value it at 86, which is the highest for this agent.
- Agent 6 gets item 5, as they value it at 42, which is the highest for this agent.

After assigning these items, one item remains (item 3). We'll allocate it to the agent who values it most among those who haven't received an item that they value highly already:

- Agent 2 values item 3 at 78, which is higher than any other agent's valuation of unallocated items.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value relatively highly, and all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [5]
}
```
