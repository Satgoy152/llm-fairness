Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  36  55  77  49  92  97  21
1  42  81  14  96  21  59   6  35
2  52   2   3  77  93  43  26  22
3  66  96  73   7  73  85  23  50
4   1  37  66  28  46  60   9  77
5  64  84  21  96  73  16  29  46
6  96   4  97  13  88  72  23  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [96  4 97 13 88 72 23 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation of items each agent receives while ensuring every agent receives some items. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, at least one agent will receive two items.

Let's use a simple heuristic approach: assign each item to the agent who values it the most, with a preference to distribute items evenly among agents when possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Item 0 (value 96) is most valued by Agent 6.
2. Item 1 (value 96) is most valued by Agent 3.
3. Item 2 (value 97) is most valued by Agent 6.
4. Item 3 (value 96) is most valued by both Agent 1 and Agent 5, so we can assign it to Agent 1.
5. Item 4 (value 93) is most valued by Agent 2.
6. Item 5 (value 92) is most valued by Agent 0.
7. Item 6 (value 97) is most valued by Agent 0.
8. Item 7 (value 77) is most valued by Agent 4.

Now, let's distribute the items in a way that each agent gets at least one item:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 6.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 6 (Agent 6 gets two items here).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 4.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0, 2]
}
```
