Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  31  20  57  17  48  73  77
1  38  17  34  18  25  64  69  76
2  56  37  75  91  85  33  99   1
3   5  50  46  80  21  55  33  99
4  65  46  60   1  94   4  78  90
5  51  61  24  98  97  36   6  99
6  98  32  52  97  42  53  97  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [98 32 52 97 42 53 97 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to aim for a distribution where each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 7.
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 6.
4. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 3.
5. Agent 4 has the highest value for item 4.
6. Agent 5 has the highest value for item 5.
7. Agent 6 has the highest value for item 1.

This leaves item 2 unallocated. Since none of the agents have an unusually high valuation for item 2, we can assign it to an agent with fewer items or lower total value. In this case, Agent 4 has one of the lesser total values, so we assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1]
}
```
