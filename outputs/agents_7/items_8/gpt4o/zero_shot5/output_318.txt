Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  93  33  94  65   1   5  56
1  94  87  85  34  77  67  55  97
2   7  61  72  63  35  24   5  22
3  38  58  10   2  39  75  95  19
4  62  29  33  80  85  93  96  36
5   0  10  97  82   8  14  40  33
6  60  69  11  67  43  63  73  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the overall allocation maximizes the agentsâ€™ valuations. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and then allocate the highest valued item to each agent in turn.

2. By repeating the process and ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item, we can balance the distribution fairly.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 3 (value 94)
- Agent 1: Allocate item 7 (value 97)
- Agent 2: Allocate item 2 (value 72)
- Agent 3: Allocate item 6 (value 95)
- Agent 4: Allocate item 5 (value 93)
- Agent 5: Allocate item 1 (value 10)
- Agent 6: Allocate item 4 (value 43)

After ensuring each agent receives one item, we need to fairly allocate the remaining item:

- Allocate the remaining item 0 (value 60) to Agent 6, who can increase their total value.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the valuation for each agent as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [0, 4]
}
```
