Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  36  97  78  87  14   7  15
1  36   1  22  46  66   4  68  23
2  47   7  98   0  77  13  25  84
3  18   3  65  57  64  25  84  83
4   0   3  49  92  63  42  93  54
5  70   2  38  36  98  19  81  11
6  50  32  30  96  76  80  14  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent for the items they receive. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others receive 1 item each. We'll try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 highly (97) and item 0 (81) as well. We can give Agent 0 item 2.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 highly (68). We can give Agent 1 item 6.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 highly, but it is already taken. The next highest value is for item 7 (84). We can give Agent 2 item 7.
4. Agent 3 values item 6 highly, but it is already taken. The next highest value is item 7, but that is taken too. The next highest is item 3 (57). We can give Agent 3 item 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 highly (93), but it is already taken. The next highest is item 3 (92), but it's taken too. The next highest is item 5 (42). We can give Agent 4 item 5.
6. Agent 5 values item 4 highly (98). We can give Agent 5 item 4.
7. Agent 6 values item 3 highly, but it is already taken. The next highest is item 5 (80), but it's taken too. The next highest is item 6 (76), but it's taken too. The next highest is item 0 (50). We can give Agent 6 item 0.

With one item left to assign, we need to identify which agent should receive a second item. We will look at the remaining items and allocate the one with the highest value for the remaining agent.

Let's finalize the allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 2
2. Agent 1: Item 6
3. Agent 2: Item 7
4. Agent 3: Item 3
5. Agent 4: Item 5
6. Agent 5: Item 4
7. Agent 6: Item 0

Finally, since Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1 (36), we can assign them this item as well. Thus, Agent 0 will have two items.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [0]
}
```
