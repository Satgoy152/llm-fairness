Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93   4  94   2  75  92  48  76
1  69  11  37  26  37  72  86  98
2  34  88  25  95   3  56  54  41
3  43  93  80  99  86  44   9  73
4  42  54  87   6  97  47  69  53
5  90  83  48  79  71  98  70  39
6  69  11  85  78  20  39   1  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Given that there are 8 items and 7 agents, we'll start by ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and one agent will receive two items.

Here's a possible allocation based on maximizing each agent's highest valuation:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 2 (value 94).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 7 (value 98).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (value 95).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 1 (value 93).
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 4 (value 97).
6. **Agent 5**: Assign item 5 (value 98).
7. **Agent 6**: Assign item 6 (value 85).

Now, redistribute the remaining item:

- Agent 0 can also be assigned item 0 (value 93) as it has the next highest valuation.

This way, all items are allocated, and we try to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6]
}
```
