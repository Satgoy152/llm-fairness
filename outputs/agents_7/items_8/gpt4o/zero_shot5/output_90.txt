Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  26  86  29  60  58  48  45
1  34  23  85  51  94  84  60  63
2  91  18   1  33   4  37  52  90
3  32  12  41  64  24  79  74  55
4  28  85  98  46  29  82  48  18
5  38  43   0  37  92  58  74  92
6  38  86  78   2  36  83  97  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 7 agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A common approach is to allocate items based on each agent's highest valuation, ensuring that the distribution is as balanced as possible. Here's one way to do it:

1. Identify the highest valued item for each agent.
2. Allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given table:

- Agent 0: 2
- Agent 1: 4
- Agent 2: 0
- Agent 3: 5
- Agent 4: 1
- Agent 5: 7
- Agent 6: 6, 3

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [6, 3]
}
```
