Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  41  91  85  25  53   9  99
1  16  56  73  90  16  74  74  50
2  45  86  76  75  87  92   5  85
3  44  28   6  72  58  26  99  57
4  97   7  10  91  66  72  58  21
5  60  45  95   2  40  93  68  87
6  40  26  46  24  26   3  43  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 41 91 85 25 53  9 99]
 [16 56 73 90 16 74 74 50]
 [45 86 76 75 87 92  5 85]
 [44 28  6 72 58 26 99 57]
 [97  7 10 91 66 72 58 21]
 [60 45 95  2 40 93 68 87]
 [40 26 46 24 26  3 43 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 7 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a simple strategy to ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and that the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) is maximized.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Start by assigning the highest value item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Continue assigning the remaining items, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, while also considering which agents have not yet received any items.
3. Once each agent has at least one item, continue assigning the remaining items to maximize the total valuation.

Let's perform this allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 7 (99), so assign item 7 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (90), so assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 (92), so assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6 (99), so assign item 6 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 0 (97), so assign item 0 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 2 (95), so assign item 2 to agent 5.
- Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 7 (81), but item 7 is taken, so assign item 4 (26) to agent 6.
- Lastly, assign item 1 to agent 0, as it provides the highest additional valuation (41) among the remaining options.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [4]
}
```
