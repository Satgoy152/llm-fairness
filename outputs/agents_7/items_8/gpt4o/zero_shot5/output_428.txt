Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  52  29  17  74  68  35  76
1  75  34  69   0  58  10  78  70
2  13  45  35  99  95  15  72  65
3  66  80  86  12   5  69  80  18
4  71  74  15  68  22  45  80  68
5  13  78  19  19  42  21  95  10
6  79  80  73  89  85  52  32  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. We have to ensure that each item is allocated to exactly one agent, and each agent can receive zero or more items.

Here's one possible allocation that distributes the items fairly:

- Agent 0 gets item 7.
- Agent 1 gets item 6.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 5.
- Agent 5 gets item 2.
- Agent 6 gets items 0 and 4.

This allocation strives to give each agent an item they value highly, while ensuring all items are distributed. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0, 4]
}
```
