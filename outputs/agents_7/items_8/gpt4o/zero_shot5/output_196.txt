Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  91  56  35  95  29  32  44
1  43   2  25   8  68  98  14  22
2  69  21  84  64  51  56  71  68
3  32  54  58  16  20  53  38  32
4  49  12  80  66  47  18  77  81
5   3  77  59  90  62  84  31  61
6  92   6  38  83   3  28  93  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[62 91 56 35 95 29 32 44]
 [43  2 25  8 68 98 14 22]
 [69 21 84 64 51 56 71 68]
 [32 54 58 16 20 53 38 32]

 [ 3 77 59 90 62 84 31 61]
 [92  6 38 83  3 28 93 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to assign items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all 8 items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 4 (95).
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5 (98).
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 2 (84).
4. Agent 3 has a relatively high valuation for items 2 (58) and 5 (53), but we'll opt for item 3 (16) since item 2 is better for Agent 2.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 7 (81).
6. Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 3 (90).
7. Agent 6 has a high valuation for item 0 (92).

Now, we need to ensure all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 6 (38)
- Agent 4: Item 7
- Agent 5: Item 3
- Agent 6: Item 0

This leaves item 1 unallocated. Since Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1 (91), it would be beneficial to assign item 1 to Agent 0 as well.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [0]
}
```
