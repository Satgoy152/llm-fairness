Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  63  93  71  96  51  81  17
1   0  31  53  74  81  93   0  30
2  21   5  97  42  89  62  91  45
3  87  41  16  64  22  55  85   7
4  44  33  48  13  28  35  22  67
5  76  70  92  86  11  59  32  79
6  76  84  15  85  67   9  37  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. One straightforward approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the most at 96.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the most at 93.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most at 97.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most at 87.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 the most at 67.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the most at 86.
7. Agent 6 values item 1 the most at 84.

Now, one item remains (item 6). We can assign it to an agent who values it reasonably while maintaining fairness in the distribution:

- Agent 0 values item 6 second highest at 81.

Allocating the remaining item to agent 0, we get:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.
