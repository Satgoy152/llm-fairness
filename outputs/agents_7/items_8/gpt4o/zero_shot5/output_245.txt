Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  30  48  78  84  97  17   1
1  20  62  98   5  22  77  70  77
2  79  25  96  94  81  72  49  59
3  21  91  46  11  43   3  21   2
4  34   8  11  95  34  80  43  17
5  85  82   8  63  92  29   8   8
6  67  88  61  21  13  73  40  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item (or as evenly as possible given the constraints). Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation per Item:** For each item, identify which agent values it the most.
2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most until each agent has at least one item or as evenly as possible.
3. **Adjust to Ensure All Items Are Assigned:** If some items remain unassigned due to ties or constraints, assign them to the next highest valuation agent who can receive more items.

Let's apply this approach to the given data:

- **Item 0:** Highest valuation is by Agent 5 (85).
- **Item 1:** Highest valuation is by Agent 6 (88).
- **Item 2:** Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (98).
- **Item 3:** Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (95).
- **Item 4:** Highest valuation is by Agent 5 (92).
- **Item 5:** Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (97).
- **Item 6:** Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (70).
- **Item 7:** Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (77).

Now let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 1:** Items 2, 6, 7 (values: 98, 70, 77)
2. **Agent 4:** Item 3 (value: 95)
3. **Agent 5:** Items 0, 4 (values: 85, 92)
4. **Agent 6:** Item 1 (value: 88)
5. **Agent 0:** Item 5 (value: 97)

With this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets items 2, 6, and 7.
- Agent 4 gets item 3.
- Agent 5 gets items 0 and 4.
- Agent 6 gets item 1.

Agents 2 and 3 don't get any items as all items have been allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 6, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 4],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and that the assignment is based on maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive.
