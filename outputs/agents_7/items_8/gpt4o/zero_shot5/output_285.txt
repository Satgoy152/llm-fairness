Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  10  35  99  57  47  14  70
1  59  52  99  70   0  55  68  52
2  11  44  96  16  10  30   6  47
3  42   7  29   5  90  68  14   3
4  36  61  26   9  88  68  56  18
5  65  79  13  67  61  32  82  61
6  80   3  81  77  31  34  78  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to distribute the total value of the items as evenly as possible among the agents. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive two items, while the others will receive one item each. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Item:**
   - For each item, calculate the total valuation across all agents.

2. **Rank Items per Agent:**
   - For each agent, determine the order of preference based on item valuation.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start by allocating the item with the highest preference to each agent until each has one item.
   - Allocate the remaining item to the agent who would have the highest total value with it.

By following these steps, we can ensure a fair allocation:

- **Item Total Valuations:**
  - Item 0: 334
  - Item 1: 256
  - Item 2: 380
  - Item 3: 343
  - Item 4: 337
  - Item 5: 334
  - Item 6: 318
  - Item 7: 275

- **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Value for Each Agent:**
  - Agent 0: Item 3 (99)
  - Agent 1: Item 2 (99)
  - Agent 2: Item 2 (96) - Already allocated to Agent 1, next best Item 7 (47)
  - Agent 3: Item 4 (90)
  - Agent 4: Item 4 (88) - Already allocated to Agent 3, next best Item 5 (68)
  - Agent 5: Item 6 (82)
  - Agent 6: Item 2 (81) - Already allocated to Agent 1, next best Item 0 (80)

- **Allocate Remaining Items:**
  - Remaining Items: 0, 1, 5
  - Assign Item 1 to Agent 4 (next best value after current allocation)
  - Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (next best value after current allocation)

Through this process, we ensure each agent gets at least one item, and remaining items are allocated to balance the total valuation.

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0]
}
```
