Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  97   8  29  61  66  38  61
1  39  74  68  57   7  85  11  13
2  96  84  82  65  26  62  15  70
3  48  26  37  68  79  35  91  81
4  44   2  95  24  87  34  58  22
5  16  95   0  80  54   1  63  42
6  38  76  69  83  18  95  49   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 97  8 29 61 66 38 61]
 [39 74 68 57  7 85 11 13]
 [96 84 82 65 26 62 15 70]

 [16 95  0 80 54  1 63 42]
 [38 76 69 83 18 95 49  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach by iterating over the items and assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the valuation table:

1. For item 0, the highest value is 96 by agent 2.
2. For item 1, the highest value is 97 by agent 0.
3. For item 2, the highest value is 95 by agent 4.
4. For item 3, the highest value is 83 by agent 6.
5. For item 4, the highest value is 87 by agent 4.
6. For item 5, the highest value is 95 by agent 6.
7. For item 6, the highest value is 91 by agent 3.
8. For item 7, the highest value is 81 by agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the items based on these selections:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets items 6 and 7.
- Agent 4 gets items 2 and 4.
- Agent 5 gets no items.
- Agent 6 gets items 3 and 5.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [2, 4],
    "5": [],
    "6": [3, 5]
}
```
