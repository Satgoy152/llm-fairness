Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  73  40  40  66  36  82  16
1  90  74  45  42  81  24  83  81
2  86  66  76  15  70  67  86  71
3  13  55  32  52  94   6  55   8
4  79  54  17  28  74  13  60  38
5  32  77  65  39  55  80  56  22
6  30  47  98  10  92  87  44  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we will aim for a distribution where each agent receives at least one item if possible, and the distribution maximizes the value for each agent based on their valuations. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If all agents have at least one item, the allocation is complete.
3. If there are agents without items, reallocate items from agents with more than one item.

Let's start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Highest value is for Agent 1 (90).
- Item 1: Highest value is for Agent 5 (77).
- Item 2: Highest value is for Agent 6 (98).
- Item 3: Highest value is for Agent 3 (52).
- Item 4: Highest value is for Agent 3 (94).
- Item 5: Highest value is for Agent 6 (87).
- Item 6: Highest value is for Agent 0 (82).
- Item 7: Highest value is for Agent 1 (81).

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [0, 7]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [3, 4]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [1]
- Agent 6: [2, 5]

Since Agents 2 and 4 have no items, we need to reallocate:

Reallocation:

- Give item 0 from Agent 1 to Agent 2.
- Give item 4 from Agent 3 to Agent 4.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [1]
- Agent 6: [2, 5]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [2, 5]
}
```
