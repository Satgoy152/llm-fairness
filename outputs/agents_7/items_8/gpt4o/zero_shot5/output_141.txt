Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  88  49  27  42  47  66  79
1  84   2  33  28   2  73  78  30
2   7  33  88  70  87   1  99  86
3  31  35  98  18   3  77  11  94
4  47  92  81  27  74  51  19  21
5  35  31  52  48  87  71   0  52
6  24  59  36  27  79  85  59  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction or valuation for each agent. We can do so by ensuring each agent receives items they value highly, while also taking into account that each agent will receive at least one item (since there are 7 agents and 8 items).

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 75)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 6 (value 78)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 2 (value 88)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 3 (value 18)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 4 (value 74)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 5 (value 71)
7. **Agent 6**: Item 7 (value 72)

This allocation distributes the items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction per item and ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Agent 0, with higher values in items 0 and 7, receives item 0. Agent 1, with a strong preference for item 6, receives that item. Agent 2 gets item 2, which they value the most, and so on. 

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [7]
}
```
