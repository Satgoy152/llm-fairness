Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  51  72  73  28  16  56  46
1  44  78  74  68  79  64  86  84
2  59  28  35  83  95  23  54  50
3  33  48  39  85   2  29  78  43
4  41   3  58  97  55  68  96  28
5  75  18  17  46  80  22  80  38
6  67  32   1   2  72   4  59  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are distributed.

Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally receive at least 1 item, with one agent receiving 2 items due to the total number of items being greater than the number of agents.

Here's one approach to achieving a fair distribution:

1. Review the table and distribute items based on the highest value for each agent.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item.
3. Assign the remaining item to the agent who has the highest combined value for two items.

The allocations can be structured as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (67)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (79)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (83)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (78)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (68)
- Agent 5: Item 7 (38)
- Agent 6: Item 1 (32)

Now, we have one extra item to allocate. Let's assign the remaining item 2 to Agent 1 who also had a high valuation for another item:

- Agent 1: Item 2 (74)

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [1]
}
```
