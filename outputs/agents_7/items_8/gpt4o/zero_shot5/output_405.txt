Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  32  89  91  30  48  46  12
1  21  95  23  39  86  19  33  55
2  85  36  18  69  68  37  43  57
3  98  26  44  89  30  24  14  15
4   7  39  99  82  49  78  64  21
5  31  43  86  88  94  24  49  56
6  22  13   3  32  62  70  13  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll use a simple approach to allocate items to agents that value them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 3 (98).
2. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 1 (95).
3. Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 4 (99).
4. Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 0 (91).
5. Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 5 (94).
6. Item 5 has the highest value for Agent 6 (70).
7. Item 6 has the highest value for Agent 4 (64).
8. Item 7 has the highest value for Agent 6 (83).

Allocations:

- Agent 0: [3] 
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [2, 6]
- Agent 5: [4]
- Agent 6: [5, 7]

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 6],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving items according to their highest valuation.


```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5, 0],
    "6": [6]
}
```
