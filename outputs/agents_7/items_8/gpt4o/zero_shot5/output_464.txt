Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  67  78  53  23   5  59  21
1  71  93  50  82  68  84  59   8
2  49  57   9   3  24   3  79  25
3  17  19  77   1  25  79  87  95
4  29  57  25  91  81  69  54  90
5  13  61  27  98  63  88  63  83
6  27  83  32  20  40  29   6  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can follow a process that attempts to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's try to allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (78), Item 1 (67)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (93), Item 5 (84)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest values: Item 6 (79), Item 1 (57)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest values: Item 7 (95), Item 6 (87)

5. Agent 4:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (91), Item 7 (90)

6. Agent 5:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (98), Item 5 (88)

7. Agent 6:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (83), Item 4 (40)

Now, let's allocate the items considering these high-value preferences and ensuring each item is allocated once:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 0
- Item 1: Assign to Agent 1 (highest value preference)
- Item 2: Assign to Agent 0
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 5 (highest value preference)
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 6
- Item 5: Assign to Agent 1
- Item 6: Assign to Agent 3
- Item 7: Assign to Agent 4

Here is the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [4]
}
```
