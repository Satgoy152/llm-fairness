Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  63  40  26  92  59  95  14
1  98  82  15  55  56  41   1  43
2  75  13  31  87  12  36  51  38
3  74   1  54  17  47  15  28  94
4  35  79  93  41  34  78  72  90
5  93  60  28  48  90  93  84  48
6  63  60   1  46  92  12  84  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to distribute the 8 items in a way that considers the agents' preferences (valuation) for each item. A common approach to achieving a fair distribution is to assign items to agents based on maximizing their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item or as evenly as possible.

Let's start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations. We'll go through a process of elimination by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most at 98.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 63, but agent 4 values it more at 79.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 4 values it the most at 93. 
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most at 87.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 92.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 5 values it the most at 93.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most at 95.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the most at 94.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the highest, and all 8 items are allocated. Agent 6 is not assigned any items due to the constraints of maximizing the overall valuation.
