Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72   8  49  25  14  36   2   2
1  52  65  81  98  16  11  14  11
2   7  75  32  89  20  55  22  20
3  87  84  25  99  41  84   1   2
4  52  84  24  38  42  36   4  13
5   2  59   5  10  39  74  95  43
6  87  45  83  85  47  79  46  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all 8 items are distributed. One method to achieve this is to allocate items based on maximizing the total valuation of items each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible and no agent gets more than one item initially until all agents have been considered.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 5.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.
- Agent 5 gets item 6.
- Agent 6 gets items 2 and 7.

This allocation ensures that each item is given out, and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2, 7]
}
```
