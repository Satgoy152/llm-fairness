Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64   1  68  20  62  37  48  69
1  25  88   7  20  36  99  91  51
2  10  63  49  68  72  17   3  79
3  33  24  94  86  96   8  30  35
4  13  55  99  52  27  21  87   7
5  10  88  75  56  40  65   0  41
6  35  57  36  24  78  74  24  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on their highest valuation.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 64).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value 88).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 4 (value 99).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3 (value 86).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 3 (value 96).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 99).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 4 (value 87).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value 79).

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. Hereâ€™s the resulting allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [2, 6],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are allocated among the agents, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
