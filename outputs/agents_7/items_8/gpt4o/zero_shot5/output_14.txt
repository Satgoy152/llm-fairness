Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  86  13  92  60   9  67  30
1  94  26  23  94  89   6  42  32
2  55   7  20   4  97   1  99  89
3   4  10  91  85  23  28  92  60
4  44  68  77  96  28  70  43  65
5  22  73  97  18  50   4  16  66
6  36  70   6  89  85  40  30  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated. One common approach to fair allocation is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. However, since we have more agents (7) than items (8), one agent will inevitably receive no items.

Let's proceed by attempting to allocate items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (92).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (94).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (99).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (91).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (96), but it's already taken, so next is item 1 (68).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (97), but it's already taken, so next is item 1 (73).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (85).

Let's optimize this allocation to ensure all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 0
- **Agent 2**: Item 6
- **Agent 3**: Item 2
- **Agent 4**: Item 1
- **Agent 5**: Item 5
- **Agent 6**: Item 4, 7

Now, let's ensure that all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [5]
- Agent 6: [4, 7]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 7 agents.
