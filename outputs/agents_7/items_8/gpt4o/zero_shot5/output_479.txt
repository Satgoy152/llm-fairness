Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  87  86   1  76  32  43  20
1  83  63  39  35  61  32  44  80
2   3  49  99  63  42   0  52  27
3  96  93  55  85  61  94  14  90
4  99  11  35   1  66  86  41  91
5  71  58  63  39  86  75  52  12
6  41  23   3  61  84  79  76   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all 8 items are distributed. A common approach to achieve this is using a greedy algorithm, where we assign each item to the agent who values it most, ensuring each agent does not receive more than one item more than any other agent.

Let's compute the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it at 99 (highest).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it at 93 (highest).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it at 99 (highest).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it at 85 (highest).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 5 values it at 86 (highest).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it at 94 (highest).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 6 values it at 76 (highest).
8. **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it at 90 (highest).

Now, we need to ensure that items are distributed fairly among agents, with no agent receiving more than one item over another. Adjustments must be made since currently, agent 3 is over-allocated.

Let's adjust allocations to balance distribution:
- Reallocate some items from agent 3 to other agents who also value those items significantly.

Revised allocation:
- **Item 0**: Agent 4
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 (second-highest value)
- **Item 2**: Agent 2
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 (second-highest value)
- **Item 4**: Agent 5
- **Item 5**: Agent 6 (second-highest value)
- **Item 6**: Agent 3
- **Item 7**: Agent 3

Now, every agent receives at least one item, and allocations are more balanced.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [5]
}
```
