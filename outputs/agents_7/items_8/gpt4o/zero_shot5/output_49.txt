Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  82  17   5  46  17  86  50
1  94  19  99   2  35  30  66  95
2  94   5  48  88  63   6  93  17
3  23  35  83  76  81   9  77   2
4  16  68  75  13  41  85  93  91
5  82  92  24  83  33  70   0  92
6  19  78  67  42  17  48  62  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [19 78 67 42 17 48 62 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets a reasonable share of the items based on their preferences. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent with the highest valuation for that item. If multiple agents have the same valuation for an item, we can choose arbitrarily among them or use a tiebreaker system.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (94).
2. Item 1: Agent 5 has the highest valuation (92).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (99).
4. Item 3: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (88).
5. Item 4: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (81).
6. Item 5: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (85).
7. Item 6: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (86).
8. Item 7: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (95).

Now let's format the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 2, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent, respecting their preferences as much as possible.
