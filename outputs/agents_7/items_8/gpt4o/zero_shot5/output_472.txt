Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  36  15  37  35  64  84  47
1  97  96  17  87  76   4  70  31
2  94  31  32  95  54  56  48  96
3  92   8  12  38  18  12  70  30
4  93  71  41  35  53  87  72  59
5  87  60  14  23  95  47  29  13
6  81  34  68  32  41  58  12  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a subset of items that maximizes their total valuation, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, some agents may not receive any items, and some may receive more than one.

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing the agents' valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this item the most with 97.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 also values this item the most with 96.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 6 values this item the most with 68.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values this item the most with 95.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 5 values this item the most with 95.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values this item the most with 64.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 and Agent 3 both value this item at 70, but since Agent 3 has no items yet, assign it to Agent 3.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values this item the most with 96.

Allocating items as per the above logic, we ensure each item is assigned to the agent who values it most, while also ensuring that each agent gets at least some items or the opportunity to get items they value highly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [2]
}
```
