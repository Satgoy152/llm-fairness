Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  15  28  33  87  65  40  98
1  19   6  36  46  23  37  64  13
2  31  92  38  77  22  45  20  23
3  96  39  71  83  37  96  25  79
4  41  45  72  74  82   2  28  40
5   4  86  85  36  65  20  96  82
6  72  29  62  17   4  35  94  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [19  6 36 46 23 37 64 13]

 [72 29 62 17  4 35 94 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on each item.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

After evaluating the table, here's a fair allocation of items to agents:

- Agent 0: Item 7 (value 98)
- Agent 1: Item 6 (value 64)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (value 92)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (value 83)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (value 82)
- Agent 5: Item 2 (value 85)
- Agent 6: Item 5 (value 35)

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item and that exactly 8 items are distributed. We'll assign the remaining item 0:

- Agent 3 gets item 0 (value 96), as it's the highest value remaining and doesn't infringe on the fairness of other allocations.

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [5]
}
```
