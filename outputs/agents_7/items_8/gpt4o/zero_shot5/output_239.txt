Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  97  11  92  95  22  47  41
1  31  22  62  80   1  92  65  37
2  23  67  24   8  68  81  88  96
3  72  62  50  47  33  65  23  72
4  61  40  20  13  75  37  34  67
5  89  32   0  75  14  53  54  36
6  49  77  47  10  15  79  28  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. One common approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 5 values it the most with a value of 89.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 97.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 62.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 92.
5. Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 75.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 92.
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 88.
8. Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 96.

Based on this approach, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each item going to the agent who values it the most.
