Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  26  21  13   3   2   8  10
1  79  96  48  63  19  53  79  78
2  56  49  83  40  56  34  54  15
3  39  34  57  97  38  15  39  32
4   0   3  31  48  64   1  98  56
5  15  49  28  68  25  48  50  69
6  43  44  27  74  40  88  13   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to maximize the overall satisfaction or value obtained by the agents from the items they receive. One approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm, where we assign items to agents based on the highest valuations until all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more than necessary.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values this item the most with a value of 85.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values this item the most with a value of 96.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values this item the most with a value of 83.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values this item the most with a value of 97.
- Item 4: Agent 4 values this item the most with a value of 64.
- Item 5: Agent 6 values this item the most with a value of 88.
- Item 6: Agent 4 values this item the most with a value of 98.
- Item 7: Agent 5 values this item the most with a value of 69.

Now let's distribute these allocations into the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 6],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is based on their highest valuations for the items.
