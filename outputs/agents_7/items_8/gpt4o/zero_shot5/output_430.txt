Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  34  72  26  39  21  87  96
1   5  94  87  72  60  61  94  30
2  22  27  96  77   8  32  29  67
3  27  45  81  32  73  39  96   7
4  81  83   1   9  38  89  57  52
5  49  69  45  16  32  66  82  75
6  98  36  87  74  31  81  72  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, given there are 7 agents and 8 items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:** This will help us decide which agent values each item the most.
2. **Assign items based on the highest valuation:** Distribute the items to the agents based on who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
3. **Adjust for fairness and ensure all items are allocated:** Since there are 7 agents and 8 items, at least one agent will receive two items. Ensure that this allocation is balanced and fair.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0:** Agent 6 values it the most (98).
- **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it the most (94).
- **Item 2:** Agent 2 values it the most (96).
- **Item 3:** Agent 2 values it second most (77), after Agent 6.
- **Item 4:** Agent 3 values it the most (73).
- **Item 5:** Agent 4 values it the most (89).
- **Item 6:** Agent 3 values it the most (96).
- **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it the most (96).

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 7.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 3.
- Agent 3 gets items 4 and 6.
- Agent 4 gets item 5.
- Agent 5 gets no items.
- Agent 6 gets item 0.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0]
}
```
