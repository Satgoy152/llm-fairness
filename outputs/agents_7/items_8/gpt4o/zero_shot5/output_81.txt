Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  65  88  38  15  92  30  38
1  43  13  83  90  49  45   4  40
2  82  41  11  75  54   2  61  10
3  68  53  57  33  97  78  83  35
4  81  88  76  15  90  37  60  35
5  45   3  93  57  37  90  18  91
6  17  19  95  70  47  50  25  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to assign items to the agents who value them the most while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Determine the highest value each agent places on any item.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed.

Based on the given valuations, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 7 the most.
- Agent 6 values item 2 the most.
- Remaining item 6 can be allocated to the agent with the next highest valuation.

The allocation can be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives an integer number of items, and a fair attempt is made to maximize satisfaction based on their valuations.
