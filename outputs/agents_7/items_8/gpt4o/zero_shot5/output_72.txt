Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  77  51  40  50  94  25  84
1  37  33  60  28  88  52  79  31
2  80  37  54   3  24  79  16  42
3  59  29  38  18  26  57   6  79
4  63  82  67  83   1  69  30  22
5  39   0  21   6  84  47  56  89
6  64  34   0  28  72  14   2  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. The goal is to allocate based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent where possible, while ensuring fairness. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Calculate total valuation for each item across all agents.**
2. **Allocate items to agents based on highest individual valuations.**
3. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, and no agent receives more than one item than any other agent.**

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 5 (highest value 94)
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (highest value 88)
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (highest value 80)
- Agent 3 gets item 7 (highest value 79)
- Agent 4 gets item 3 (highest value 83)
- Agent 5 gets item 6 (highest value 56)
- Agent 6 gets item 1 (highest value 34)
- Remaining item: item 2 is allocated to Agent 4 (next best value 67)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3, 2],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [1]
}
```
