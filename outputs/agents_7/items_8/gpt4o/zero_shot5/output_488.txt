Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  67  17  14  22  94  51  48
1  10  12  19  30  30  61  62  23
2  31  45  21  79  66  71  67  22
3  35  48   9  20  40  97   9  66
4  69  24  51  33  20  15  10  43
5  43  66  11  36  54  51  65  64
6  61  10  83  20  37  20  47  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 7 agents, we can use a strategy that balances the total value each agent receives based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign each agent at least one item if possible to ensure fairness.
- Distribute remaining items to agents in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction based on their valuations.

Given the valuations, a balanced allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [6]
- Agent 2: Item [3]
- Agent 3: Item [7]
- Agent 4: Item [2]
- Agent 5: Item [1]
- Agent 6: Item [4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [4]
}
```
