Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  45  78  84  92  88  92  89
1  55  13  95  98   1  88  44  82
2  58  22  25   0  14  83  21  41
3  23  76  12  96  94  97  67  41
4  32  61  78  88  44   0  19  49
5  80  27  46  93   2  98  93  31
6  46  23  23  76  69  55  25  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of exactly 8 items allocated. We should aim to maximize the total satisfaction or valuation for each agent based on their preferences. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocated item 4 (value 92)
   - Allocated item 5 (value 88)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocated item 2 (value 95)
   - Allocated item 3 (value 98)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocated item 1 (value 22)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Allocated item 7 (value 41)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Allocated item 0 (value 32)

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Allocated item 6 (value 93)

7. **Agent 6**:
   - No items allocated

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents based on the highest values they place on those items.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6],
    "6": []
}
```
