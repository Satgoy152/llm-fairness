Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  80  82   1  27  26  56  88
1  62  36  99  82  65  17  44  32
2  62  35  80   6  98  96  79  37
3  68  65  78  83  76  80  68   3
4  25  41  78  58   2  74  22  68
5  43  76   7  52  16  44  32  14
6  50  64  22  68  98  24  87  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [62 36 99 82 65 17 44 32]

 [50 64 22 68 98 24 87 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuation while making sure that all 8 items are assigned. One approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Based on this strategy, let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values 69 (highest)
- Item 1: Agent 0 values 80 (highest)
- Item 2: Agent 1 values 99 (highest)
- Item 3: Agent 3 values 83 (highest)
- Item 4: Agent 2 and Agent 6 value 98 (highest), let's give it to Agent 2
- Item 5: Agent 2 values 96 (highest)
- Item 6: Agent 6 values 87 (highest)
- Item 7: Agent 0 values 88 (highest)

Now let's format the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while also respecting the constraint that only 8 items are allocated in total.
