Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  85  46   3   0  61  66  14
1   8  33  99  51   8  39  66  30
2  86  55  58  40   6  70  55  33
3  72  21  77  74  12  11  32  86
4  13  23  80  17  27   9  88  90
5  13  41  98  95   1  94  37  48
6  36  43  20  47  95  30  46  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent's list of items is an integer and the total number of allocated items is exactly 8. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most at 86.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 85.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 5 values it the most at 95.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 6 values it the most at 95.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 5 values it the most at 94.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the most at 88.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 4 values it the most at 90.

With this allocation strategy, here is the corresponding JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [],
    "4": [6, 7],
    "5": [3, 5],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most while maintaining fairness in distribution. Note that Agent 3 does not receive any items in this allocation.
