Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  22  67  72  46  91  15  19
1  49  16  27  83  48  93  94  64
2  40  10  91  47  28   7  47  16
3  81  11  31  31  76   2  72  24
4  75  41  74  56  28  58  36   1
5  59   2  97  48  99  51  98  70
6  33  64  21  27  23  35  57  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item across all agents and try to allocate that item to the respective agent.

2. If an agent receives more than one item, check if reallocating any item to another agent results in a fairer distribution.

3. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0 has the highest valuation by agent 3 (81).
- Item 1 has the highest valuation by agent 6 (64).
- Item 2 has the highest valuation by agent 5 (97).
- Item 3 has the highest valuation by agent 1 (83).
- Item 4 has the highest valuation by agent 5 (99).
- Item 5 has the highest valuation by agent 1 (93).
- Item 6 has the highest valuation by agent 1 (94).
- Item 7 has the highest valuation by agent 6 (72).

Now, let's review the allocation:

- Agent 3 receives item 0.
- Agent 6 receives items 1 and 7.
- Agent 5 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 3, 5, and 6.

All items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2, 4],
    "6": [1, 7]
}
```
