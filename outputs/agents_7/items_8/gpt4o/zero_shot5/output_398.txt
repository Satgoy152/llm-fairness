Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  82  97  78  93  57  76  71
1  72  83  16  65  28  61  53  69
2  57  45  64  91  40  26  35  53
3   0  32  99  31  61  92  91  76
4  83  78  73  82  17  18   1  82
5  45  43  26  18  13  99  83  96
6   5  41   2  40   7  30  77  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the total allocation is exactly 8 items. A simple way to do this is to allocate items based on the highest valuation by each agent. Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation is for item 2, with a value of 97.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 1, with a value of 83.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 3, with a value of 91.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation is for item 2, with a value of 99. However, item 2 is already allocated, so we move to the next highest, which is item 5, with a value of 92.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation is for item 0, with a value of 83.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest valuation is for item 5, with a value of 99. However, item 5 is already allocated, so we move to the next highest, which is item 7, with a value of 96.
7. **Agent 6**: The highest valuation is for item 6, with a value of 77.

Now we need to ensure that all 8 items are allocated. We have allocated items 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7, leaving items 4 and 2 unallocated. Let's allocate these remaining items to balance the distribution more evenly:

- Agent 1 can take item 4, as they also value it fairly (28).
- Agent 2 can take item 7, as they have a decent valuation for it (53).

Now we can present the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item (except Agent 5, who doesn't have a high valuation for any remaining items), and all 8 items are allocated.
