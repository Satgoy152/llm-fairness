Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  20  67  79  51   1  40  36
1  89  96  91  81  31  93  81  63
2  66  44   5   4   7  94  15   1
3  92  11  17  39  90  22  60  18
4  59  78  73  57  73  28  91  47
5  86   0  87   5  29  96  61  24
6  77  71  92  54  64  58  30  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuation for each agent, and try to allocate that item to them if possible.
2. Ensure all items are allocated and no agent receives more than one item unless necessary.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (79).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (96).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (94).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (92).
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most (91).
- Agent 5 values item 5 the most, but it's already taken, so the next highest is item 2 (87).
- Agent 6 values item 2 the most, but it's already taken, so the next highest is item 6, but it's taken too, so they get item 0 (77).

Since each agent must receive at least one item, and all items must be allocated, let's double-check:

- Item 0: Agent 3
- Item 1: Agent 1
- Item 2: Agent 5
- Item 3: Agent 0
- Item 4: Allocate to Agent 6, as they have no item and this is the remaining unallocated item
- Item 5: Agent 2
- Item 6: Agent 4
- Item 7: Allocate to Agent 6, as they have fewer items compared to others

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to maximize each agentâ€™s highest valuation, and every agent receives at least one item.
