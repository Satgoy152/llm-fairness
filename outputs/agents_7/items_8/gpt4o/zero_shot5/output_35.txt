Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  84  32  20  43  65   9  59
1  78  89  78   0  69  90  33  16
2  10  81  35  84  61  29  27  14
3  85  97  17  68  60  83  43  88
4  71  69  82  72  29  62  11   4
5  42  38  28  63  71  31  60  66
6  83  69  53  61  44  28  23  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agentâ€™s overall satisfaction, based on their valuations, is balanced. Since there are 7 agents and 8 items, most agents will receive one item, and one agent will receive two items. Let's allocate the items by maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness among all agents. 

Here's a potential allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (valuation: 84)
2. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (valuation: 90)
3. Assign item 3 to agent 2 (valuation: 84)
4. Assign item 7 to agent 3 (valuation: 88)
5. Assign item 2 to agent 4 (valuation: 82)
6. Assign item 6 to agent 5 (valuation: 60)
7. Assign item 0 to agent 6 (valuation: 83)
8. Assign item 4 to agent 6 (valuation: 44)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, with agent 6 receiving two items to account for the extra item, maximizing their total valuation. 

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0, 4]
}
```
