Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  84  83  19  70  90  67  33
1   1  50  51  37  53  89  20  30
2  60  23  90  81  33  28  10  28
3  70   5  62  43  93  11  65  31
4   7  40  90  71  97  91  39  81
5  58  70  28  53  72  75  83  26
6  74  83  85   1  63  42  70  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from the items they are allocated, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Using a simple heuristic approach, we can allocate items to agents based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 5 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it highly (90).
2. Assign item 4 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it highly (97).
3. Assign item 6 to agent 5, as agent 5 values it highly (83).
4. Assign item 7 to agent 6, as agent 6 values it highly (98).
5. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it highly (51).
6. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it highly (81).
7. Assign item 0 to agent 3, as agent 3 values it highly (70).
8. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it highly (84).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total valuation for each agent, given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [7]
}
```
