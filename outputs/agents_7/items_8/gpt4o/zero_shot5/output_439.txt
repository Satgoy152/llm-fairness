Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  30  49  18  62  26  51  51
1  53  72   8   8  75  56  55  93
2  27  92  64  58  83  36  36  66
3  46  54  20  19  42  13   9  78
4  89  69  64   5  60  46   3  12
5   6  12  49  95  34  55   3  69
6  39  39  31  33   6   4  75  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated. The goal is to maximize overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuations. One approach to achieve fairness is to assign items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 62.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 the highest at 93.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 92.
4. Agent 3 values item 7 at 78, but it is already taken by Agent 1. Next highest is item 1 at 54, taken by Agent 2. Next is item 0 at 46.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the highest at 89, but it is already taken by Agent 3. Next highest is item 1 at 69, taken by Agent 2. Next is item 2 at 64.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the highest at 95.
7. Agent 6 values item 6 the highest at 75.

Now let's assign items based on these preferences:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 2
- Agent 5: Item 3
- Agent 6: Item 6

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [6]
}
```
