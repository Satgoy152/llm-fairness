Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  94  11  19  21  58  13  25
1  73  25  41   0   5  67  45  57
2  82  71   3  16  56  20  89  68
3   6  46  16  24  51   9  31  45
4  87  94  70  14  26  79  78  38
5  53  73  68  63  38   9  45   9
6  68  61  37  20  79  17  80  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [73 25 41  0  5 67 45 57]

 [68 61 37 20 79 17 80 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation, while also being as equitable as possible. Given there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 1 (Value: 94)
2. Agent 1: Item 5 (Value: 67)
3. Agent 2: Item 6 (Value: 89)
4. Agent 3: Item 4 (Value: 51)
5. Agent 4: Item 0 (Value: 87)
6. Agent 5: Item 2 (Value: 68)
7. Agent 6: Items 3 and 7 (Values: 20 and 19)

This allocation aims to give each agent an item they value highly, while minimizing the disparity in total valuation.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [3, 7]
}
```
