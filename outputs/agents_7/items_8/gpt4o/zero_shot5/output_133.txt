Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  29  19  16  61  29  11  62
1  97  90  86  28  19  69  61  42
2  12  67  89  75  47  28  99  15
3  71  44  72  16  26  59  11   9
4  94  90  77  70  76  38  26  15
5  37   6  63  68  53  83  78  76
6  40  64  20   0  49  39  65  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that each agent receives items they value highly while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest value for each item across all agents.
2. Assign the item to the agent who values it the most.
3. If there's a tie in values, distribute the items in such a way that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's apply this method:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (97).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (90).
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (89).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (75).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (61).
- Item 5: Agent 5 values it the most (83).
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (99).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most (62).

Now, let's distribute these allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3, 6
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: Item 5
- Agent 6: No items

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3, 6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5],
    "6": []
}
```
