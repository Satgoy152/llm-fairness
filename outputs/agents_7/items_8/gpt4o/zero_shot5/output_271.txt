Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  60  92  64  17  51  43  57
1  37  42  16  48   9  20  51  84
2  56   9  91  15  85  55  63  46
3  42  21  79  69  25  89  93  14
4  24  27  64  85  30  52  86  77
5  70  87  26  22  13  13  94  61
6   8  93  17   4  61   2   1  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. Here is one possible allocation that attempts to consider the agents' values for the items:

1. Start by prioritizing the allocation based on the highest value each agent assigns to items.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
3. Distribute remaining items to maximize the total value for each agent.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 7.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.
- Agent 3 receives item 6.
- Agent 4 receives item 5.
- Agent 5 receives item 1.
- Agent 6 receives item 4.

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed.
