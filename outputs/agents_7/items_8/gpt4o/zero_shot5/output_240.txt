Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  80  33  66  73  68  17  78
1  54  26  25  56   2  67  72  35
2  26  90  48  62  82  47  21   9
3  73  30   6  88  71  87  89   1
4  51  25   6  79  64   9  50  55
5  21  60  49  58  46  51  45  82
6  27  88  48  52  70  38  31  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and the allocation maximizes the total valuation across all agents. We can achieve this by assigning items based on the highest valuation for each item.

Let's go through the items and allocate them to the agents who value them the most:

1. **Item 0:** Highest value is 73 by Agent 3.
2. **Item 1:** Highest value is 90 by Agent 2.
3. **Item 2:** Highest value is 49 by Agent 5.
4. **Item 3:** Highest value is 88 by Agent 3.
5. **Item 4:** Highest value is 82 by Agent 2.
6. **Item 5:** Highest value is 87 by Agent 3.
7. **Item 6:** Highest value is 89 by Agent 3.
8. **Item 7:** Highest value is 82 by Agent 5.

Now, let's ensure the allocation is fair. Currently, Agent 3 has 4 items, Agent 2 has 2 items, and Agent 5 has 2 items. We aim to distribute the items more evenly among the agents, while still respecting their valuations.

Let's adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets an item:

- **Agent 0:** Item 0
- **Agent 1:** Item 6
- **Agent 2:** Item 1
- **Agent 3:** Item 3
- **Agent 4:** Item 7
- **Agent 5:** Item 2
- **Agent 6:** Item 4

This distribution ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the distribution is fairly balanced given the constraints. Now, let's format this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [4]
}
```
