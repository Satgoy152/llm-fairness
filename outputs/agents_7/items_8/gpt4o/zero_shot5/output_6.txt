Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  15   9  79  61  69  25  87
1   0  26  31  54  52  80  64  60
2  58  55  88  13  75  59   0  93
3  49  22  72  80   2  22  63  43
4  75  62  48  92  25  83  99  39
5  54  98  51  30  28  27  33  24
6  55  55  30  64  15  14   7  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute them such that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring that exactly 8 items are allocated in total. Here's one way to do it by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 7 (87) and 3 (79).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 5 (80) and 3 (54).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 2 (88) and 7 (93).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 3 (80) and 2 (72).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are for items 6 (99) and 3 (92).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest values are for items 1 (98) and 2 (51).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest values are for items 3 (64) and 0 (55).

We will try to allocate based on their preferences, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and every item is allocated.

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 7.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 5.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 2.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 3.
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 6.
- **Agent 5**: Assign item 1.
- **Agent 6**: Assign item 0.
- We still need to allocate one more item. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 4 since they have a high valuation for item 4 (25).

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed.
