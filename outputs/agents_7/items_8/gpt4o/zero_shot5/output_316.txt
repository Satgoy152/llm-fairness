Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  10  52  60  46  56  27  34
1  23  96  43  48  58   0  85  98
2  16  62  24  52  19  23  58   9
3   3  59  26  80  72  44  73  72
4  39  89  24  57  82  39  10  54
5  49  29  81  17   0  42   2  86
6  78  66  27  15  50  63  90  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in such a way that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. Given the table, I'll allocate the items to maximize the overall happiness of the agents by considering their highest valued items first. Here's one way to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Has a strong preference for items 3 (60) and 5 (56).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 7 (98) the most.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 6 (58).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 (80) highly, but since it's already allocated, we'll consider item 6 (73).
5. **Agent 4**: Strong preference for item 4 (82).
6. **Agent 5**: Prefers item 2 (81).
7. **Agent 6**: Values item 0 (78) the most.

Based on these preferences, here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [3, 5]
- **Agent 1**: [7]
- **Agent 2**: [6]
- **Agent 3**: []
- **Agent 4**: [4]
- **Agent 5**: [2]
- **Agent 6**: [0, 1]

Let's ensure that each item is allocated only once and that we have 8 allocations in total. This allocation distributes the items based on the highest preferences of the agents, aiming to maximize satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0, 1]
}
```
