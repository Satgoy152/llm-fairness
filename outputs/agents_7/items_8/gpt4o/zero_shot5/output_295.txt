Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  49  71  40  29  41  70  57
1  88  86  10  37  98  29  92  77
2  80   6  39  57  78  16  42  25
3  92  94  39  92   6  27  36  81
4  74  93  97  32  41  68  94  27
5   9   2   6  68  13  33  88  43
6  94  28  56  97  17  53  49  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to iteratively assign each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0: The highest valuation is 94 by agent 6.
2. Item 1: The highest valuation is 94 by agent 3.
3. Item 2: The highest valuation is 97 by agent 4.
4. Item 3: The highest valuation is 97 by agent 6.
5. Item 4: The highest valuation is 98 by agent 1.
6. Item 5: The highest valuation is 68 by agent 4.
7. Item 6: The highest valuation is 94 by agent 4.
8. Item 7: The highest valuation is 81 by agent 3.

After assigning the items based on these valuations, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [2, 5, 6],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed based on the highest valuations, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
