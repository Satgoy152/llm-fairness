Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  56  89  34  99  45  52  11
1  80  77  19  60  54  21   2  52
2  71  45  98  65  71  79  82  80
3  36   1  81  58  73  88  68  48
4  68  68  34  70  84  35  18   8
5  45  94  37  91  69  92  34  94
6  60  39  97  37  78  47  28  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90 56 89 34 99 45 52 11]
 [80 77 19 60 54 21  2 52]
 [71 45 98 65 71 79 82 80]
 [36  1 81 58 73 88 68 48]
 [68 68 34 70 84 35 18  8]
 [45 94 37 91 69 92 34 94]
 [60 39 97 37 78 47 28 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total value that each agent receives. We'll perform the allocation by checking the highest value each agent has for available items and assigning items accordingly to balance the overall value received by each agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 99, so we give them item 4.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 80, so we give them item 0.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 98, so we give them item 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest at 88, so we give them item 5.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the highest at 70, so we give them item 3.
6. Agent 5 values item 7 the highest at 94, so we give them item 7.
7. Agent 6 values item 6 the highest at 82, so we give them item 6.
8. Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has received one item, except Agent 1, who will not receive a double allocation to ensure fairness.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [6]
}
```
