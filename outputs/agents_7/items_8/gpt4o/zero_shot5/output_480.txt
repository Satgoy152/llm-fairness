Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  59  35  40  47  26  77  21
1  40   6  55  74  85  79  96  57
2  16  14  81  93   5  95  60  90
3  28  87  82  41  30  30   0  24
4   2   4  30  17  84   8  85  77
5  46  76  37  13  29  16  33  86
6  32  23  90  19  48   4  85  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, one strategy is to use the idea of maximizing the sum of valuations. However, since each agent will receive at least one item, we also need to ensure that no agent is left without an item. Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, at least one agent will receive 2 items.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent over all items.
2. Allocate one item to each agent based on their highest valuation for an item that hasn't been allocated yet.
3. Allocate the remaining items to agents who would benefit the most from receiving an additional item.

Applying this strategy to the given table:

1. **Total Valuation per Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 336
   - Agent 1: 492
   - Agent 2: 454
   - Agent 3: 322
   - Agent 4: 307
   - Agent 5: 333
   - Agent 6: 385

2. **Initial Allocation (1 item per agent):**
   - Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 77)
   - Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 85)
   - Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 93)
   - Agent 3 gets item 1 (value 87)
   - Agent 4 gets item 7 (value 77)
   - Agent 5 gets item 0 (value 46)
   - Agent 6 gets item 2 (value 90)

3. **Allocate Remaining Item:**
   - The remaining item is item 5.
   - The highest valuation for item 5 is by Agent 2 (value 95), who will receive this additional item.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [2]
}
```
