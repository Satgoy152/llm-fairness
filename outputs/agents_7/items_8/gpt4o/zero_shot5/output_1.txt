Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  70  40  87  46   4  82  89
1  43  18   4   3  33  69   9  20
2  86  71  88  88   6   1  97  40
3   2  72  37  58  83   5  67  67
4  78  47  16  12  12  75  25  44
5  76  29  98  70  33  63  84  24
6  89  67  45   1  41  87   8  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [89 67 45  1 41 87  8 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction, while ensuring that every agent receives at least one item. The satisfaction can be measured by the value an agent assigns to the items they receive. We'll aim for a balanced distribution based on the valuation table. 

Let's analyze the table to find an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: High values for items 0, 3, and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values for items 2 and 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: High value for item 5.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value for item 2.
7. **Agent 6**: High values for items 0 and 7.

Let's allocate considering the highest available value each agent assigns to an item:

- Agent 0 will get items 3 and 7.
- Agent 1 will get item 5.
- Agent 2 will get item 6.
- Agent 3 will get item 4.
- Agent 4 will get item 1.
- Agent 5 will get item 2.
- Agent 6 will get item 0.

Now, we'll present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0]
}
```
