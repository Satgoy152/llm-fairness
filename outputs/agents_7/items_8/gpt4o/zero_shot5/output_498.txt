Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  70   0  45  86   3  41  46
1   8  18  98  51  40  65  21  73
2   7  23  41  98  35   5   9   9
3  19  56   2  94  77  74  77  85
4  23  86  77  26  42  95  87  73
5  52  55  34  87  65  30   0  63
6  72  90  42  14  13  23  13  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. We can consider maximizing the total valuations of the items allocated to each agent, which means trying to assign items to the agents who value them the most.

Here's a possible allocation that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0 is valued highest by agent 6 (value: 72).
2. Item 1 is valued highest by agent 6 (value: 90).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by agent 1 (value: 98).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by agent 2 (value: 98).
5. Item 4 is valued highest by agent 0 (value: 86).
6. Item 5 is valued highest by agent 4 (value: 95).
7. Item 6 is valued highest by agent 4 (value: 87).
8. Item 7 is valued highest by agent 3 (value: 85).

Based on these considerations, the allocation can be structured as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that every agent is considered and at least 8 items are allocated in total.
