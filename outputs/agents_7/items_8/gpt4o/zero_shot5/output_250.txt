Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  95  34  75  27  27  40  17
1  66  11  35  81  73  72  59  91
2  12  30  60  34  74  61  98  24
3  20  39  82  70  16  29  53  48
4   1  37  27  90  29  50   4  53
5  54  88  27  41  91  18  27  94
6  97   5  65  63  49  11  13  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [66 11 35 81 73 72 59 91]

 [97  5 65 63 49 11 13 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. Given the valuations, one approach to fairness is to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 6 (value = 97, highest for this item).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value = 95, highest for this item).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 3 (value = 82, highest for this item).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 4 (value = 90, highest for this item).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 5 (value = 91, highest for this item).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value = 61, highest for this item).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value = 98, highest for this item).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 1 (value = 91, highest for this item).

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one item with the highest possible value to them, given the constraints. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [0]
}
```
