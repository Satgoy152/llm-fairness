Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  56  77   0  57  41  34  54
1  68  65  75   1  39  80  45  86
2  34  90  93  43  86  87  53   5
3  92  71  57  31  25  53  25  88
4   7   7  37  73  92  35  97  64
5  28  65  10  41  46   8  66  69
6  68   2  16  82  33  76  67  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple strategy where each agent tries to maximize their total valuation of the items they receive. We need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and exactly 8 items are allocated in total. Let's aim for a balanced approach while considering the agents' valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If there are conflicts (more than one agent wants the same item), try to redistribute to maintain balance or select the next best option for one of the agents.

Following this strategy, let's determine the allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (77).
- Agent 1 values item 7 the most (86).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most, but since it is already taken, we assign item 1 (90).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (92).
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most (97).
- Agent 5 values item 7 the most, but since it is already taken, we assign item 5 (8).
- Agent 6 values item 3 the most (82).

Now, let's assign the remaining items to balance the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 4 (57).
- Agent 2 receives item 5 (87).
- Agent 3 receives item 7 (88).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents as fairly as possible.
