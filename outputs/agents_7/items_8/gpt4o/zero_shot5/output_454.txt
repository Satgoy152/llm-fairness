Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  66  43  61  24  46  60  58
1  13  30  85  41  42   4  36  61
2   1  99  63  75  63  68  92  90
3  34  53  34  16   8  52  29  95
4  24  30  50  88  72  25  62  36
5  81  60  62  79   2  14  19  90
6  90  20  79  79  18  15  99  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will need to consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. We will attempt to distribute the items based on the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's break down the process:

1. Identify the highest valuation item for each agent and allocate it.
2. If more than one agent values the same item highly, prioritize the agent with fewer items already allocated.
3. Continue until all items are allocated. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item where possible.

After considering these steps, here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [4]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 5 as they have relatively high valuations for these items compared to others.
- Agent 1 gets item 2, which has the highest valuation for them.
- Agent 2 gets item 1, which they value the highest, and no other agent values it as much.
- Agent 3 is assigned item 7, which they value highly.
- Agent 4 receives item 3, which is one of their higher-valued items.
- Agent 5 gets item 6, which is among the higher valuations for them.
- Agent 6 is allocated item 4, which has the highest valuation for them compared to others.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents fairly, considering their valuations.
