Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  50  80  77  71   8  10  67
1  84   5   7  30  30  20  63   2
2  74  31  83  63  82  90  50  66
3  86   2  25  61  24  64  55  92
4   4  59  12  47  81  94  64  98
5  58  73  32  11  98  46  55  41
6   2  85  99  66  85  83  62  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued item for agent 0 is item 2 (value 80).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued item for agent 1 is item 0 (value 84).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued item for agent 2 is item 5 (value 90).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valued item for agent 3 is item 7 (value 92).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valued item for agent 4 is item 7 (value 98), but since it's already assigned, the next is item 5 (value 94), but already assigned. Next is item 6 (value 64).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest valued item for agent 5 is item 4 (value 98).
7. **Agent 6**: The highest valued item for agent 6 is item 2 (value 99), but already assigned. Next is item 1 (value 85).

One item is left unassigned, which is item 3. We will allocate it to the agent with the next highest valuation for fairness and balance:

- **Agent 2** can get item 3 (value 63), the next highest available value.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [1]
}
```
