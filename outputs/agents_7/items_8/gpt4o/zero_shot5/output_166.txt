Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  21  41  93  33  37  54  92
1  22  79  14  10  28  46  76  66
2   4  85  85  39  85  59   4  89
3  49  81  57  25  25  90  31  33
4  42  11  79  71  66  33  52  76
5  44  14  99  63  81  38  55  95
6  13   7   0  12  61  71   9  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to maximize each agent's valuation of the items they receive. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, at least one agent will receive more than one item. We'll take a look at the table to identify which items are valued the highest by each agent, aiming for a fair distribution of total value.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 (93) and item 7 (92) highly.
- Agent 1 values item 1 (79) highly.
- Agent 2 values item 2 (85), item 1 (85), and item 4 (85) the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 5 (90) the highest.
- Agent 4 values item 2 (79) and item 7 (76) highly.
- Agent 5 values item 2 (99) and item 7 (95) the highest.
- Agent 6 has lower valuations, but item 5 (71) is the highest.

Let's allocate the items based on these observations:

- Agent 0: [3, 7]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: [6]
- Agent 6: [0]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8. Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0]
}
```
