Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  59  75  47  98  55  67  79
1  47  61  50  53   7  59  86   6
2  31  85   5  82  26  92  46  25
3  94  54   3  74  36  97  81  19
4  14   6  25   6   2  69  77  80
5  24  73  50  93  61  86  26  74
6  44  74  94   8   9  35   7  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value of the items. Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally receive at least one item, but since we have one extra item, one agent will receive two items.

Let's calculate the total value of all items for each agent and then allocate items in a way that tries to balance the total value received by each agent.

**Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**
- Agent 0: 17 + 59 + 75 + 47 + 98 + 55 + 67 + 79 = 497
- Agent 1: 47 + 61 + 50 + 53 + 7 + 59 + 86 + 6 = 369
- Agent 2: 31 + 85 + 5 + 82 + 26 + 92 + 46 + 25 = 392
- Agent 3: 94 + 54 + 3 + 74 + 36 + 97 + 81 + 19 = 458
- Agent 4: 14 + 6 + 25 + 6 + 2 + 69 + 77 + 80 = 279
- Agent 5: 24 + 73 + 50 + 93 + 61 + 86 + 26 + 74 = 487
- Agent 6: 44 + 74 + 94 + 8 + 9 + 35 + 7 + 84 = 355

**Step 2: Allocate Items to Balance Total Value**
We will allocate items in such a way that the difference in total value between any two agents is minimized.

**Allocation Strategy:**
1. Allocate the highest valued items to the agents with the lowest total valuation.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.
3. Allocate the remaining item to the agent that increases fairness.

**Step 3: Perform the Allocation**
- Agent 4: [4] (smallest total value, gets the item with value 2)
- Agent 6: [3, 7] (second smallest, gets items with values 8 and 84)
- Agent 1: [0] (next, gets item with value 47)
- Agent 2: [1] (next, gets item with value 85)
- Agent 3: [5] (next, gets item with value 97)
- Agent 5: [6] (next, gets item with value 26)
- Agent 0: [2] (next, gets item with value 75)

**Final Allocation:**
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and we attempt to balance the total value each agent gets as fairly as possible given the constraints.
