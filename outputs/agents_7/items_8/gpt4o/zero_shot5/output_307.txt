Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  94  27  52   2  89  92   7
1  34  80  84  92  75  48   1  33
2  87  40  74  83  52  17  82  91
3  24  20  98   5  87  62  15  86
4  39  96  37  83  64  64  30  87
5  11  21  35  43  30  20  67   1
6  68  61  17  71  98  92  77  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and exactly 8 items are allocated in total. Here's one way to do this:

1. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most. 

2. In cases where multiple items are valued highly by the same agent, try to balance the total number of items each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and no agent gets more than necessary.

Based on the given valuations, here's a possible allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (Value: 87)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 4 (Value: 96)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 3 (Value: 98)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (Value: 92)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 6 (Value: 98)
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (Value: 89)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 5 (Value: 67)
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 2 (Value: 91)

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed to the agents in a manner that respects their valuations and fairly divides the items.
