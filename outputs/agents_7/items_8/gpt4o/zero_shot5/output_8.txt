Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3   8  86  37  98  56   5  63
1  88  62  54  93  50  89  78  27
2  77  71  19  21  55  52  52  21
3  28  17  37  14  90  31  86  83
4  86  84  96  16  76  87  56  36
5  40  86  86  20  91  37  55  76
6  67  89  80  21  93   8  25  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed. 

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the highest value item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring an even distribution where each agent receives at least one item, if possible.
2. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4 (valued at 98)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (valued at 93)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (valued at 77)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (valued at 86)
- Agent 4: Item 2 (valued at 96)
- Agent 5: Item 5 (valued at 37) and Item 7 (valued at 76)
- Agent 6: Item 1 (valued at 89)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5, 7],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, all items are allocated, and the valuations are considered to provide a fair distribution.
