Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  33  31  98  96  24  40  59
1  28  78  11  99  46  94  71  49
2  78  29   9  44  65  29  39  23
3  60  20  15  54   7  26  21  74
4  41  89  48  14   6  21  48  10
5  95  80  21  90  54  78  82  41
6  84  85  98  92  46  36  87  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, I'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every item is assigned to exactly one agent. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning the items based on the highest valuation per item, ensuring no agent receives more than their fair share of items.
2. If there are conflicts (multiple agents with the highest valuation for the same item), consider the overall distribution to ensure fairness, possibly breaking ties by considering the next highest valuation for an unassigned item for each agent.

Here's a possible allocation of items:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (value 98)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (value 94)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (value 65)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (value 74)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (value 89)
- Agent 5: Item 0 (value 95)
- Agent 6: Items 2, 6 (values 98, 87)

This allocation gives each agent at least one high-value item, and ensures that all 8 items are allocated. Now, let's format this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [2, 6]
}
```
