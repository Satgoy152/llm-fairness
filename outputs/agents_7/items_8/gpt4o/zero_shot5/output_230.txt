Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68   1  35  90  10  50   4  45
1  70  80   9  62  98   3  32  85
2  11  23  18  75  92  59  30  44
3  34  77   4  63  82  44  91   3
4   8  13  78  82  96  38  78  37
5  29  74   2  98  67  26  83  63
6  10   6  23  17  31   6  49  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 8 items are distributed. The goal is to maximize the total valuation across all agents. We can use a simple greedy approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's evaluate each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 70.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 80.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most at 78.
- Item 3: Agent 5 values it the most at 98.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 98.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 59.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most at 91.
- Item 7: Agent 6 values it the most at 90.

Now we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This distribution ensures that all 8 items are allocated and maximizes the total valuation for each agent based on the given table.
