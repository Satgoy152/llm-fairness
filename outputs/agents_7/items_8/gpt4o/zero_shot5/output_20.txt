Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  19  98  55  13  50   5  64
1  58  17  67  36  80  49  43  78
2  28  57  94  72   1  70   1  71
3  18  99  57  87  24  20  68   4
4  94  51  53  64  55  78  96   6
5  46  45  50  93  21  18  26  46
6  41  75  57  90  97  41  75  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. The goal is to maximize the total valuation while ensuring fairness in distribution. Here is a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0: Allocate item 2, as it has the highest value (98) for that agent.
2. Agent 1: Allocate item 4, as it has the highest value (80) for that agent.
3. Agent 2: Allocate item 0, as it has the highest value (28) for that agent.
4. Agent 3: Allocate item 1, as it has the highest value (99) for that agent.
5. Agent 4: Allocate item 6, as it has the highest value (96) for that agent.
6. Agent 5: Allocate item 3, as it has the highest value (93) for that agent.
7. Agent 6: Allocate item 5, as it has the highest value (41) for that agent.

The final item left is item 7, which can be allocated to Agent 1 as they have a relatively high valuation (78) for that item.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their valuations while ensuring no agent is left out without a significant item.
