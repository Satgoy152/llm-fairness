Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  89  18  46  62  63  83  17
1  74  61   7  43  75  44  29  94
2  71   3   4  63  98  80   7  72
3  98  19  59  22  69  34  51  74
4  27  93  30  17  64  96  38  56
5  62  61  99  78  65  86  87   8
6  21  52  33  80  75  46  58  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one item each. We will aim to maximize the total valuation by assigning items based on the highest value each agent places on them. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 1 (value 89)
2. Agent 1: Item 7 (value 94)
3. Agent 2: Item 4 (value 98)
4. Agent 3: Item 0 (value 98)
5. Agent 4: Item 5 (value 96)
6. Agent 5: Items 2 and 6 (values 99 and 87 respectively)
7. Agent 6: Item 3 (value 80)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 8. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2, 6],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This JSON output shows the allocation of items to each agent based on maximizing their individual valuations.
