Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  66  41  50  42  45   2  90
1  29  38   9  50  30  50   5  50
2   8  36   9  74  57  24  31  21
3  49  76  14  69  18  84  59  34
4  20  52   9  40   5  65   9  74
5  31  48  80  85  77  68  27  90
6  74  72  10  27  72  54  93  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to give each agent a collection of items that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring that all items are distributed. One approach to achieve this is to focus on the highest valuations for each agent and distribute accordingly.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has a high valuation of item 7 (90), so we assign item 7 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation of item 3 (50), so we assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3, but since it's already taken, we choose item 4 (57) for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5 (84), so we assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 has the highest valuation for items 5 and 7 (65 and 74), but since both are taken, we assign item 1 (52) to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 has the highest valuation of item 2 (80), so we assign item 2 to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 6 (93), so we assign item 6 to Agent 6.

The remaining item to allocate is item 0. We assign it to Agent 6 since they have the next highest valuation for it after Agent 0, who has already received an item.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [6, 0]
}
```
