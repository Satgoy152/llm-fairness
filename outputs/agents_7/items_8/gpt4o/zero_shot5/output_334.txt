Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  18  92  75  61   3  24  10
1  16  93   7  66  49  91  73  81
2  72  77   0  10  94  99  78  83
3  42  90  89   8  97  22  79   4
4  57  52  73  60  98  49  50  33
5  35  22  92  20  55  42  53  93
6  33   2   5  38  49   9   3  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocated item 2 (value 92)  
2. **Agent 1**: Allocated items 1 (value 93) and 5 (value 91)
3. **Agent 2**: Allocated item 4 (value 94) 
4. **Agent 3**: Allocated item 6 (value 79)
5. **Agent 4**: Allocated item 3 (value 60)
6. **Agent 5**: Allocated item 7 (value 93)
7. **Agent 6**: No items allocated

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that tries to maximize their satisfaction given their valuations. The allocation is also balanced in terms of distributing the total value fairly.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [7],
    "6": []
}
```
