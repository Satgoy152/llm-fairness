Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  85   4  39  47  74  62  26
1  36  51  66  77  96  51  19  30
2  32   3  28  31  44  26  25  96
3  12  56  35  33  34  68   0  39
4  86  31  18  42  34  18  81  83
5  82  63  81  79   1  90  57  40
6  49  63  24  81  45  75  84  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we will use a method that ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes the total valuation for all agents. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify which items are most valuable to each agent based on the valuation table.
2. Allocate the items to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least a fair share.

Based on the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (85).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (96).
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most (96).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most (68).
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most (86).
- Agent 5 values item 5 the most (90).
- Agent 6 values item 6 the most (84).

Considering the above, here is one way to allocate the items:

- Assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Assign item 7 to agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to agent 3.
- Assign item 0 to agent 4.
- Assign item 2 to agent 5.
- Assign item 6 to agent 6.
- Assign item 3 to agent 5 (to ensure all items are allocated and to give agent 5 a second item).

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent gets the items they value highly. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2, 3],
    "6": [6]
}
```
