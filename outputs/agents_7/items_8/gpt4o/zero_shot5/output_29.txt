Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  20  22   6  70  19  74   4
1  27  26  72  83  64  77  52  47
2  14  66  76   1  30  10  21   8
3  87  14  40  98  27   6  95  82
4  46  39   6  61  53  87  65  23
5  67  58   8  26  25  25  34  71
6  54  96  38  97   6   7  24  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the total utility for each agent based on their valuations. A possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 0:
   - Highest value is 87 by agent 3.

2. Item 1:
   - Highest value is 96 by agent 6.

3. Item 2:
   - Highest value is 76 by agent 2.

4. Item 3:
   - Highest value is 98 by agent 3 (already has item 0, but there are no better allocations).

5. Item 4:
   - Highest value is 70 by agent 0.

6. Item 5:
   - Highest value is 87 by agent 4.

7. Item 6:
   - Highest value is 95 by agent 3 (already has items 0 and 3, but no other agent values any item more than once).

8. Item 7:
   - Highest value is 82 by agent 3 (already has items 0, 3, and 6, but no other agent values any item more than once).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3, 6, 7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with agent 3 receiving the most due to having the highest valuations for multiple items.
