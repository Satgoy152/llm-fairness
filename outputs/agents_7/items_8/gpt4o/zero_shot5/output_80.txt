Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  55  35  18  53  63  45  29
1  80   1  41  19  44  22  95   7
2  79  23   4  55  97  83  21  72
3  55  29  39  20  33  10  64  22
4  34  53  88  82  79  20   4  94
5  70  42  82   9  48  41  10  47
6  73  25  91  74  27  93  66  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [80  1 41 19 44 22 95  7]

 [73 25 91 74 27 93 66 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items while also maximizing the total valuation. Given there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 0 (valuation = 78)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 6 (valuation = 95)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 4 (valuation = 97)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 2 (valuation = 39)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 7 (valuation = 94)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 5 (valuation = 41)
7. **Agent 6**: Items 3 and 1 (valuation = 74 + 25 = 99)

Here is the JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed among the 7 agents, maximizing the total valuation while adhering to the requirement that each agent receives at least one item.
