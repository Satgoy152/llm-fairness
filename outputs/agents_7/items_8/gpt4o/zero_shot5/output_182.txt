Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  19   0  38  44  72  64  41
1  66   4  24   1  22  21   0  37
2  24  94  20  10  17  93  29  25
3  75  73  52  95  28  28  94  93
4  78  67  66  23   9  66   5  39
5  86  43  39  17   9  10  21  41
6   2  18  26  45  75  94  42  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 19  0 38 44 72 64 41]
 [66  4 24  1 22 21  0 37]
 [24 94 20 10 17 93 29 25]
 [75 73 52 95 28 28 94 93]
 [78 67 66 23  9 66  5 39]
 [86 43 39 17  9 10 21 41]
 [ 2 18 26 45 75 94 42 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while also attempting to distribute the items as evenly as possible. Here is a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 7.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3 and 6.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Agent 5 has no highest valuation but can take item 4.
- Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 5.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed.
