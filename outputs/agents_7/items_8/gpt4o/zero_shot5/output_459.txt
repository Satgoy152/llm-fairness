Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  79  19  25  24  86  28  19
1  95  42   1  48  56  33  22  20
2  74   2  40  58  78  33  86  31
3  29  30  71  78  18  18  93  53
4  18  13  22   2  74  95  55  14
5  74  23  66  64  36  61  51  79
6  99  54  75   2  22  92  72  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we need to consider their valuations. A fair allocation can be subjective, but we will aim for a solution where each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation maximizes the total value each agent receives relative to their valuation.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Items 0 and 5 (values: 37 and 86)
2. Agent 1: Item 3 (value: 48)
3. Agent 2: Items 4 and 6 (values: 78 and 86)
4. Agent 3: Item 2 (value: 71)
5. Agent 4: Item 7 (value: 14)
6. Agent 5: Item 1 (value: 23)
7. Agent 6: No items

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent is considered, and all 8 items are fairly distributed among the agents.
