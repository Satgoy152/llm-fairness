Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  46  42  49  43  11  58  49
1  85  46  25  67  14   2  68   4
2  58  59  44  28  77  91  91  99
3  71  19  23  12  30  11  71  14
4   8  72  41  93  82  81  39  78
5  63  94  36  16  15  97  85  54
6  30  56  66  94  76  52  88  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest value each agent has for any item.
2. Allocate the items to the agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each item is only allocated once.
3. If there are ties (multiple agents value an item equally), allocate it to the agent who has fewer total items or lower total value thus far.

Following this approach, here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most, but since it's already allocated, we move to the next highest valued item, which is item 6, but it's also taken, so we continue down the list.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 6 values item 3 highly, but it's already taken, so go for the next highest which is item 2.

Following this process results in the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
