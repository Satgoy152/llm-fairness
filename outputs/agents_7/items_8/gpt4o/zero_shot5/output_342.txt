Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  53  85  76  74  91  84  13
1  75  55  47  98  31  41  63  92
2  84  41  75  58  87  54  26  52
3  67  58  52  40  19  80   6  54
4  73  31   4  35  27   7  36  70
5  82  43  47   2  75  14  43   2
6  22   1  91   0  63  31  24   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 7 agents, we can use a simple approach by ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will get two items while the others will get one item each.

We'll allocate items by considering the highest valuation each agent has for the items, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item with a high valuation. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the most. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most, but it's already taken, so consider their next highest values. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 the most. Assign item 7 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 0 the most, but it's already taken. Assign item 2 to Agent 5.
7. Agent 6 values item 2 the most, but it's already taken. Assign item 6 to Agent 6.

Now, one item remains unallocated. We will give it to an agent who will benefit from it the most, considering what they have already received:

8. The remaining item is 1. Agent 0 values it highly, so assign item 1 to Agent 0.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated.
