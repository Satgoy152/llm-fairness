Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  65  79  80  80  56  55  68
1  80  80   2  80  66  44  28  98
2  75   1  33   6  21  57  60  48
3  37  38  18  97  11  55   1  41
4  28  78  72  54  88  95  65  60
5  90  48   8  16  79   6  78   4
6   5  21  96  26  36  33  46  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each item is given to an agent who values it reasonably high, while also attempting to balance the overall value that each agent receives.

Let's go through the items and allocate them based on the highest value preference by each agent:

1. Item 0: 
   - Highest value is 97 by agent 0.

2. Item 1: 
   - Highest value is 78 by agent 4.

3. Item 2: 
   - Highest value is 96 by agent 6.

4. Item 3: 
   - Highest value is 97 by agent 3.

5. Item 4: 
   - Highest value is 88 by agent 4.

6. Item 5: 
   - Highest value is 95 by agent 4.

7. Item 6: 
   - Highest value is 78 by agent 5.

8. Item 7: 
   - Highest value is 98 by agent 1.

Now, let's ensure that the allocation is balanced and each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0 gets item [0]
- Agent 1 gets item [7]
- Agent 2 gets no items []
- Agent 3 gets item [3]
- Agent 4 gets items [1, 4, 5]
- Agent 5 gets item [6]
- Agent 6 gets item [2]

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, and the total number of items allocated equals 8.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4, 5],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2]
}
```
