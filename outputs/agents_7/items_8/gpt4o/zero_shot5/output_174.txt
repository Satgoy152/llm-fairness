Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  72  13  53  99  32  50  26
1  98  82  34  63  40  84  92  54
2  81  59  49  16  66   4  50   3
3  13  85  13  26  58  86   8  73
4  57  44  84  52  70  17  73  43
5  11  63  24  82  74  62  46   2
6  38  62  58  29  65  80   2  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual preferences. We will use a simple approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it the highest at 98.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 3 values it the highest at 85.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 4 values it the highest at 84.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 5 values it the highest at 82.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it the highest at 99.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 3 values it the highest at 86.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 1 values it the highest at 92.
8. **Item 7:** Agent 6 values it the highest at 92.

Let's ensure each agent receives at least one item and adjust as necessary:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: No items (needs allocation)
- Agent 3: Items 1, 5
- Agent 4: Item 2
- Agent 5: Item 3
- Agent 6: Item 7

Now, let's adjust so Agent 2 receives an item:

- Reassign Item 6 from Agent 1 to Agent 2, as Agent 1 already has an item (0).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [7]
}
```
