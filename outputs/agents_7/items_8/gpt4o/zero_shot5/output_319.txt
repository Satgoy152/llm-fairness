Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  66  55  39  17  85  34  18
1  38  18  21  88  54  62  93  70
2   8  74  16  66  21   0  45  40
3  96  79  20  65  30  34  16   5
4  82  39  79  24  61  31  29  64
5   3  54  27  67  33  52  59  84
6   7  64  36  65  15  28  46   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and no more than two items, given that we have 7 agents and 8 items. This approach helps in distributing the items fairly among all agents.

Let's consider the highest valuations for each agent and allocate accordingly:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 5.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 6.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 1.
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 0.
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 0, but since it's already taken by agent 3, the next highest is item 2.
- Agent 5 has the highest value for item 7.
- Agent 6 has the highest value for item 1, but since it's already taken by agent 2, the next highest is item 3.

Now, we have the following allocation:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: [7]
- Agent 6: [3]

One item remains unallocated (item 4). We should assign it to the agent who would benefit most from it without exceeding the limit of two items per agent and ensuring fairness. Let's see the options:

- Agent 0 has one item, and item 4 would give them a value of 17.
- Agent 1 has one item, and item 4 would give them a value of 54.
- Agent 2 has one item, and item 4 would give them a value of 21.
- Agent 3 has one item, and item 4 would give them a value of 30.
- Agent 4 has one item, and item 4 would give them a value of 61.
- Agent 5 has one item, and item 4 would give them a value of 33.
- Agent 6 has one item, and item 4 would give them a value of 15.

Agent 4 would gain the most value from item 4. Therefore, we allocate item 4 to agent 4.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [3]
}
```
