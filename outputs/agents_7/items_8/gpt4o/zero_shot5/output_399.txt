Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  44   5  34  63  21  60  86
1  99  87  53  86  42  19  42   2
2  49  99  33  69  88  81  50  88
3   5  41  45  68  20  29  69  22
4  58  76  49  16   6  63  61  16
5   2  78  46  86  47  26  71  36
6  10  88  41  45  99  85  48  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 7 agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, we'll aim to distribute the items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's one way to do this:

1. Assign items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring fairness by distributing items so that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Attempt to balance the total valuation each agent receives to ensure fairness.

Let's go step-by-step through the table to find a fair allocation:

- Agent 1 highly values item 0, so assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 1, so assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Agent 6 highly values item 4, so assign item 4 to Agent 6.
- Agent 0 highly values item 7, so assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Agent 5 highly values item 3, so assign item 3 to Agent 5.
- Agent 2 also has a high valuation for item 5, so assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 6, so assign item 6 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 highly values item 2, so assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Following this approach, we ensure each agent gets at least one item where possible, and we allocate all 8 items.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
