Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  38  33   0  82  53  55  17
1  41  79  30  43  78  33  34  77
2  24  82  64  41  60  57  80  75
3  63  79  40  11  95  82  66  45
4  55   0  25  82  81   1  39  31
5  25   0  36   5  82  55  96  31
6  57  96  25  20  10  87  70  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach to achieve fairness is to aim for an allocation that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent.

We must ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the total number of items allocated is exactly eight.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 3 because it has the highest value at 95 for agent 3.
2. Assign item 6 to agent 5 because it has the highest value at 96 for agent 5.
3. Assign item 1 to agent 6 because it has the highest value at 96 for agent 6.
4. Assign item 0 to agent 0 because it has the highest value at 63 for agent 0 (tied with agent 3, but agent 3 already has item 4).
5. Assign item 2 to agent 2 because it has a relatively high value at 64 for agent 2.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 6 because it has a high value at 87 for agent 6.
7. Assign item 7 to agent 1 because it has a high value at 77 for agent 1.
8. Assign item 3 to agent 4 because it has a high value at 82 for agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that all eight items are distributed.

Here is the final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [1, 5]
}
```
