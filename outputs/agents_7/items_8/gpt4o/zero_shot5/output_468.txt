Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  83  41  42  12   1  19  19
1  57  93  98  90  78  56  30  63
2  28  76  46  99  17  46  42  68
3  95  44  27   2  73  46  70  55
4  50   2  24  33  28  40  77  31
5  43  41  29  73  35  48   1  63
6   2  55  21  68  73  88   3  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider both the valuations of the items by each agent and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items with a total of 8 items allocated in total. Here's one possible fair allocation based on the valuations:

- Agent 0: Assign item 7 (value: 19)
- Agent 1: Assign item 2 (value: 98) and item 5 (value: 56)
- Agent 2: Assign item 3 (value: 99)
- Agent 3: Assign item 0 (value: 95) and item 6 (value: 70)
- Agent 4: Assign item 4 (value: 28)
- Agent 5: Assign item 1 (value: 41)
- Agent 6: No items assigned

This allocation tries to maximize the value each agent receives based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": []
}
```
