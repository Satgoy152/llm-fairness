Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31   9  56  56  44   2  72  81
1  86  90  24  94  92  60  32  28
2   8  34   9  55  39   3  33  50
3  20  16  21  44   7  19   2  92
4  25  60  53  87  75   6  96   8
5  40  61  69  16  24  54  16  74
6  70  66  49  64  16  20  86  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [70 66 49 64 16 20 86 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable amount of value based on their preferences. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 the highest.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest.
4. Agent 3 values item 7 the highest, but it is already taken, so the next highest is item 2.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 the highest.
6. Agent 5 values item 2 the highest, but it is already taken, so the next highest is item 1.
7. Agent 6 values item 0 the highest.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets an item and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Item 7
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 6
- Agent 5: Item 5
- Agent 6: Item 0

This leaves item 2 unallocated. Since each agent should receive at least one item, we can allocate item 2 to Agent 5, who values it next after item 1.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5, 2],
    "6": [0]
}
```
