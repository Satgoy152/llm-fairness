Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  68  57  71  47  50  91  28
1  79   4  22  82  53   9  74  76
2  60  33   9  44  57  51  73   1
3  71  45   1  83  40  21  74  88
4  19  44  36  88  88  22  28  70
5  41  31  97  55  33  22  37  18
6   0  47  89   6  62  81  69  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 0 47 89  6 62 81 69 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to maximize their satisfaction. However, since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the rest will receive 1 item each.

Let's analyze the table to find an optimal allocation:

1. Start by assigning the items to the agents who value them the most:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 79.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 68.
   - Item 2: Agent 5 values it the highest at 97.
   - Item 3: Agent 3 values it the highest at 83.
   - Item 4: Agent 4 values it the highest at 88.
   - Item 5: Agent 6 values it the highest at 81.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it the highest at 91.
   - Item 7: Agent 3 values it the highest at 88.

2. Now, we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item:
   - Agent 0: Already has items 1 and 6.
   - Agent 1: Already has item 0.
   - Agent 2: Currently has no items. We need to adjust allocations.
   - Agent 3: Already has items 3 and 7.
   - Agent 4: Already has item 4.
   - Agent 5: Already has item 2.
   - Agent 6: Already has item 5.

To ensure fairness and that each agent receives at least one item, let's adjust the allocations slightly:

- Reassign item 7 from Agent 3 to Agent 2. This gives Agent 2 an item and prevents Agent 3 from having two items.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and only 8 items are allocated in total.
