Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  38  86  47  48  72  34  35
1  25  73  87  17   2  31  49  40
2  53  67  56  69  54   7  43  92
3  39  51  35  16  54  75  97  23
4  38  92  18  60  61  26  32  96
5  26  77  25  45  70  93  36  84
6  96  55  97  89  84  71  52   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives approximately an equal share of total value, or at least make sure each agent has a fair distribution based on their preferences. Given the valuation table, we need to ensure that the distribution is as balanced as possible.

Here is a possible fair allocation of the items to the agents:

- **Agent 0** values items 2 and 5 highly, with values 86 and 72 respectively.
- **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest, with a value of 87.
- **Agent 2** values item 7 the highest, with a value of 92.
- **Agent 3** values item 6 the highest, with a value of 97.
- **Agent 4** values item 1 highly, with a value of 92.
- **Agent 5** values item 5 the highest, with a value of 93.
- **Agent 6** values item 0 and item 2 highly, with values 96 and 97 respectively. However, item 2 is already allocated to Agent 1.

One way to allocate the items is:

- Agent 0 gets items: 5
- Agent 1 gets items: 2
- Agent 2 gets items: 7
- Agent 3 gets items: 6
- Agent 4 gets items: 1
- Agent 5 gets items: 3
- Agent 6 gets items: 0, 4

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value relatively highly, balancing the overall distribution of value and ensuring each receives at least one item.

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [0, 4]
}
```
