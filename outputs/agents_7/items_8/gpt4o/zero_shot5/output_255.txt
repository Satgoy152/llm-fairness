Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  37  52  55  19  10  96  89
1  25  33  88   6  74  41   3  66
2  10  86  48  54  94  63  81   6
3  81  64  45  87  31  25  86  69
4   2  36  69  29  29  34  73  21
5  75  44  19  30   9  77  80  99
6  29  79   0  26  85  51   3  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We aim to maximize the total value across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. Here's one potential way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 6 with a value of 96.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 2 with a value of 88.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 4 with a value of 94.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is item 3 with a value of 87.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for Agent 4 is item 6 with a value of 73, but it's already taken, so the next highest is item 2 with a value of 69, but also taken. Next is item 1 with a value of 36.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value item for Agent 5 is item 7 with a value of 99.
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value item for Agent 6 is item 4 with a value of 85, but it's already taken, so next is item 1 with a value of 79, but also taken. Next is item 7 with a value of 69.

To ensure all items are allocated, we can assign the remaining items to those agents with the next highest values that haven't been allocated yet:

- Item 0 can be given to Agent 5, as it has a value of 75.
- Item 5 is left and can be given to Agent 3, with a value of 25.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7, 0],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations, and all 8 items are distributed.
