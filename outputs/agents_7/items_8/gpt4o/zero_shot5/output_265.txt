Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  87  76  50  35   9   8  78
1  94  13  58   8  41   2   1  80
2  53  68  45  56  92  40  35  79
3  74  27  40  90  14  67  22  24
4  26  44  77  88  71  24  76  35
5  24  57  34   0  56  31  67  91
6  13  40  64  56  43  21  40  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, an approach can be to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and the total number of items allocated equals 8.

Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Calculate the highest value an agent assigns to each item**: This ensures that items are initially considered for allocation to agents who value them the most.

2. **Allocate items to agents**: Start allocating items to the agent with the highest valuation for each item, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Using these steps, the allocation might look something like this:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (value 87)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (value 94)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (value 92)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (value 90)
- Agent 4: Item 2 (value 77)
- Agent 5: Item 6 (value 67)
- Agent 6: Item 5 (value 21)
- Remaining item 7 is allocated to Agent 5, who values it at 91, maximizing their total value.

In JSON format, the allocation can be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6, 7],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item with maximum valuation.
