Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  34  88  53  66  40  17  21
1  54  80  70  64   5  20  67  27
2  51  67  77  45  34  39  36  14
3  45  76  48  55  11   8  56  55
4  73  26  38  27  85  68  87  49
5   2   9  56  26  92  23  24  95
6  11   2  16  87  20  88  39  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations provided and distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents. Let's try to assign items to maximize total value for each agent, keeping in mind that each agent should receive at least one item if possible.

Firstly, the total number of items is 8, and we need to ensure that all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Assign the highest valued item to each agent in sequence if possible.**
2. **Ensure all items are distributed.**

Based on the valuations:

- Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest (88).
- Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (80).
- Agent 2 values Item 2 the highest but it's already taken, so we allocate Item 1 (67).
- Agent 3 values Item 1 the highest but it's already taken, so we allocate Item 3 (55).
- Agent 4 values Item 6 the highest (87).
- Agent 5 values Item 7 the highest (95).
- Agent 6 values Item 5 the highest (88).

Let's check the remaining unallocated items:

- Items 0 and 4 are unallocated.

Reallocate based on remaining values:
- Agent 0 also values Item 0 (75).
- Agent 4 also values Item 4 (85).

Thus, the final allocation can be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the value for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.
