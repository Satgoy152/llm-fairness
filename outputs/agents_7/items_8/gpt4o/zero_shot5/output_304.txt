Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  25  82  20  52  65  41  14
1  27  89  81  14  52  48  32  33
2  22  34  45  54  57  91  96  92
3   8  48  72  12  64  56  18   1
4  48  40  76  83  97  48  80  20
5  67  29  93   0  16  67  61  36
6  10  97  41  75  74  49  31   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. In this scenario, we have 7 agents and 8 items to allocate. 

Here is a possible allocation strategy based on maximizing the total value for each agent:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 highly (82)
2. Agent 1 values item 1 highly (89)
3. Agent 2 values item 7 highly (92)
4. Agent 3 values item 4 highly (64)
5. Agent 4 values item 6 highly (80)
6. Agent 5 values item 5 highly (67)
7. Agent 6 values item 3 highly (75)

Now, let's allocate the remaining items considering the next best-valued items for each agent. 

However, since we have 7 agents and only 8 items, each agent can only receive one item, and one agent will receive two items. 

Let's make this allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [7]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [6]
- Agent 5: [5]
- Agent 6: [3, 0] 

This allocation gives each agent an item, and one agent (Agent 6) receives two items, ensuring all 8 items are distributed.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [3, 0]
}
```
