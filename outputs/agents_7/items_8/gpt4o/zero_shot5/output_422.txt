Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  13  14  16  53  10  34  65
1  87  22  95   0  92  65  65  49
2  84  25  16  50  20  97  23  33
3  85  42   6  66  92  80  60  57
4  34  41  43  88   5  33  57  91
5  19  76   9  76  69  74   8  21
6  61  58  58   6  31  93  26  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value of the items to each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. This is a classic example of the assignment problem which can be solved using various algorithms such as the Hungarian method, but for simplicity, I'll use a heuristic approach here.

Let's proceed with the allocations based on maximizing individual item value to each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (94)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (95)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest value item: Item 5 (97)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (92)

5. Agent 4:
   - Highest value item: Item 7 (91)

6. Agent 5:
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (76)

7. Agent 6:
   - Highest value item: Item 6 (93)

Now we have allocated 7 items, and one item remains unallocated (Item 3). We can assign this item based on the next highest value to an agent with fewer items or lower total value:

- Item 3: Highest value to Agent 3 (66)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [6]
}
```
