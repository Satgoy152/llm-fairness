Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  22  25   1  31  48  69  81
1  84  54   0  42  63  53   4  38
2  30  68  85  66  45  13  41  42
3  95  42  57  94  60  30  31  40
4  42   4  90  61  47  59  41  69
5  12  82  57  28  71  96  11  63
6  27  98  17  95  66  27  82  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for each agent to receive items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, given there are 8 items and 7 agents. We will assign items based on the highest valuation, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and no item is assigned more than once.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Assign Highest Value Items:** Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most.
2. **Ensure Coverage:** Make sure no item is left unassigned.
3. **Finalize Allocation:** Adjust the allocation if necessary to ensure all items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item.

Based on the table provided, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Initially values item 7 highly (81).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 highly (84).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 highly (85).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 0 highly (95), but it's already taken, next is item 3 (94).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 highly (90), but it's taken, next is item 7 (69).
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 5 highly (96).
7. **Agent 6**: Values item 1 highly (98).

This allocation covers all the items:

- Agent 0 gets item 7
- Agent 1 gets item 0
- Agent 2 gets item 2
- Agent 3 gets item 3
- Agent 4 gets item 4
- Agent 5 gets item 5
- Agent 6 gets item 1

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1]
}
```
