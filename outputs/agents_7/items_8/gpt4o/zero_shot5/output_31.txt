Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  29  16  54  15  38  69  37
1  55  54  19  88  91  41  17   6
2   4  84  70  88  13  24  27  31
3  26  74  81  81  54  84  48  86
4  57  82  96  24  56  64  18  66
5  18  71  76   4  48  38   7  49
6  26   9  15  87   6  46  19  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable allocation based on their valuations, and every item is assigned to exactly one agent. Since we have more agents than items, some agents will not receive any items.

Let's start by looking at each agent's highest valuations and try to allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (83).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (91).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (88).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (81), but since agent 2 has a higher valuation for item 3, they should get it. Next highest for agent 3 is item 7 (86).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (96).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (76), but since agent 4 has a higher valuation for item 2, they should get it. Next highest for agent 5 is item 1 (71).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (99), but since agent 3 has a high valuation for item 7, it might be better to consider agent 6's next highest, which is item 3 (87).

Upon evaluating the valuations and ensuring each agent can get at least one item, here's a fair allocation:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 5.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 6.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item based on their highest or next highest valuation, ensuring fairness. Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [5]
}
```
