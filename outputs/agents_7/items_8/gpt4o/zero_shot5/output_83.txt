Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  95   8  97  87  41  43  91
1  91  81  81  49  97  92  79  68
2   4  92  84  89  25  54  90  46
3  86   9  89  21  95  91  87  16
4  29  24  29  58  30  51  20  52
5  50  90  47  26  26   0  69  76
6  91  52  14   2   8   8   3  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring every agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item**: 
   - For each item, determine which agent values it the most.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation**:
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item where possible.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**:
   - Ensure that no agent is left without an item if possible. If some agents are left without an item, redistribute from agents with multiple items, aiming to keep the total valuation high.

Let's apply this process to the table provided:

1. **Valuations**:
   - Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (91)
   - Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (95)
   - Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (89)
   - Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (97)
   - Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (97)
   - Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (92)
   - Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (90)
   - Item 7: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (91)

2. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 7]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 4, 5]
   - Agent 2: Item [6]
   - Agent 3: Item [2]
   - Agent 4: []
   - Agent 5: []
   - Agent 6: []

3. **Adjustments for Fairness**:
   - Since Agents 4, 5, and 6 have no items, we need to redistribute some items from Agents 0 and 1, who have multiple items.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Redistribute some items to ensure every agent has at least one item.

Here is a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed based on the highest valuations while trying to maximize fairness.
