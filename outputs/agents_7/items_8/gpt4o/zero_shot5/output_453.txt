Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  41  61  90  35   3  55  20
1  72  63  31  77  54  74   9  62
2  73  29  61  18  20  10  57  87
3  83   2  25  58  26  36   5  23
4  38  30  29  44  70  27   8   3
5  65  71  57  28  95  71  25  93
6  91  62  91  42  13  19  71  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [91 62 91 42 13 19 71 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives or ensure that the allocations are balanced in some way. Given there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items while the others receive one. We can consider both the valuations and the distribution to achieve a fair allocation.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items.
2. Try to allocate based on maximizing individual agent's valuation for the items they receive while ensuring that one agent receives two items.

Using this approach, one possible allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets item 3 (90)
- Agent 1 gets items 0 (72) and 5 (74) - as they have high values for both
- Agent 2 gets item 7 (87)
- Agent 3 gets item 4 (26)
- Agent 4 gets item 1 (30)
- Agent 5 gets item 6 (25)
- Agent 6 gets item 2 (91)

This allocation attempts to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, and one agent (Agent 1) receives two items to account for the extra item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2]
}
```
