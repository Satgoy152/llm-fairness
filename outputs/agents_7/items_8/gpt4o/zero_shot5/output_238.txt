Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  16  55  65  25  47  38  10
1  85  33   5  90  51  19  98  77
2  18  67  47  10  46  64  19  11
3  82  38  27  90  97   9  38  75
4  74  37  58  76  24  43  13  99
5  73  24  40  50  69  41  28  64
6  69  61  89  82  71  46  14  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. There are several possible strategies to approach this, but a straightforward method is to allocate one item to each agent based on their highest valuation for an item that has not yet been allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value of 65 for item 3.
2. Agent 1 has the highest value of 98 for item 6.
3. Agent 2 has the highest value of 67 for item 1.
4. Agent 3 has the highest value of 97 for item 4.
5. Agent 4 has the highest value of 99 for item 7.
6. Agent 5 has the highest value of 73 for item 0.
7. Agent 6 has the highest value of 89 for item 2.

Now we have allocated all items. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [2]
}
```
