Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  64  72  98  84  87  35  64
1  78  63  92  71   0  35  27   9
2  52  94   7  16  48  29  60  35
3  32  12  17  20  52  57  27   3
4  23  32  40  31  36  72  71   2
5  45  52  69  48  79  47   8  41
6  60  34   5  87  62  17  87  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations of the items by each agent. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents by assigning items where they provide the most value to the agents.

One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most, ensuring that no agent receives more than one item until all agents have been considered.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Start by finding the highest valuation for each item and assign it to the respective agent.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item before assigning additional items to any agent, if possible.
3. Allocate remaining items by maximizing the total value across all agents.

Following this process, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (78).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (94).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (92).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (98).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (84).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (87).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (87).
- Item 7: Agent 6 values it the most (56).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and adjust the allocation if necessary:

- Agent 0: [3, 4, 5, 6] (4 items)
- Agent 1: [0, 2] (2 items)
- Agent 2: [1] (1 item)
- Agent 3: [] (0 items)
- Agent 4: [] (0 items)
- Agent 5: [] (0 items)
- Agent 6: [7] (1 item)

Since every agent should ideally have a chance to receive an item, we'll adjust to distribute items more evenly. Let's reassign one of Agent 0's less valuable items to Agent 3 and Agent 5:

- Agent 0: [3, 4, 5] (3 items)
- Agent 1: [0, 2] (2 items)
- Agent 2: [1] (1 item)
- Agent 3: [6] (1 item)
- Agent 4: [] (0 items)
- Agent 5: [] (0 items)
- Agent 6: [7] (1 item)

Now, let's finalize the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [7]
}
```
