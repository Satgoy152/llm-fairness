Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  71  98  75  13  12  66  24
1  72  19  70  80  41   6  58   0
2  34  28  92   7  72  36  32  14
3  98   6   7  23  21  32  80  30
4  66  97  80  74  80  36  10  66
5  59  52  77  28  25  56  86  30
6  58  32  34  86  45  55  14  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all 8 items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning items to the agents based on their highest valuations.
2. Make sure to distribute the items so that each agent gets at least one item.

Let's look at this step-by-step:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (98), so assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (80), so assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (92), but item 2 is already taken. The next highest is item 4 (72), so assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (98), so assign item 0 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (97), so assign item 1 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 6 the highest (86), so assign item 6 to agent 5.
- Agent 6 values item 3 the highest (86), but item 3 is already taken. The next highest is item 5 (55), so assign item 5 to agent 6.
- Finally, only item 7 is left, and it needs to be assigned to one of the agents who already have an item. Agent 4 also has a relatively high valuation for item 7 (66), so it's reasonable to assign item 7 to agent 4.

Now, let's make sure all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item:

Allocations:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [1, 7]
- Agent 5: [6]
- Agent 6: [5]

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 7],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [5]
}
```
