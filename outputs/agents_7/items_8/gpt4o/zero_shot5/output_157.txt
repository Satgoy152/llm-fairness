Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  44  58  86  15   3  43  60
1  31  27  12  79  91  62   0   0
2  74  70  12  31   7  42  74  84
3  81  72  58  20  80  32  63  55
4   9  14  19  49  12  81  96  76
5  43  32  42  61  43  65  12  22
6  42  42  47  96   1  50  46  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Given the data, we will approach this by assigning items based on the highest individual valuations.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuations for each item across all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Following this method, here is the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (value 74)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (value 44)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (value 58)
- Item 3: Agent 6 (value 96)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (value 91)
- Item 5: Agent 4 (value 81)
- Item 6: Agent 4 (value 96)
- Item 7: Agent 6 (value 90)

Now, let's distribute the items into the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [],
    "6": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed to agents based on maximizing the value each agent receives, while also ensuring that each item is allocated to only one agent.
