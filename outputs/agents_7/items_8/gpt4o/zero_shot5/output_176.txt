Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  20  62  35   9  61  45   5
1  24  11   3   6  11  75  76  84
2  43  68  74  51  35   7   3  39
3  26  46  61  15  20  89  20  59
4  80  41  95  38  33  48  99  20
5  85  45  48   7  68  68  64  79
6   8  73  94  56  61  16  68  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each gets a fair share based on their valuations. One potential method is to use a max-sum approach, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that every agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. **Allocate Items**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. **Ensure Each Agent Gets at Least One Item**: If any agent ends up with no items, reallocate to ensure fair distribution.

Let's apply this approach to the given data:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 5 (85)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 6 (73)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (95)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 6 (56)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 6 (61)
- Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (89)
- Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (99)
- Item 7: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (84)

After this initial allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [2, 6]
- Agent 5: [0]
- Agent 6: [1, 3, 4]

Now, we need to ensure each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: Needs an item, let's transfer item 4 from Agent 6 (Agent 6 has enough items).
- Agent 2: Needs an item, let's transfer item 1 from Agent 6 (Agent 6 still has enough items).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 6],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated based on the highest valuation approach.
