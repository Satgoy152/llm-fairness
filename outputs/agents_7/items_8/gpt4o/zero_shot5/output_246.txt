Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  27  33  50  25  21  31  15
1  67  19  98  85  90  70   4  32
2  23  48  73   9  98  16  47  85
3  43  23  44  80  39  99  15   1
4  31  32  64  50  24  13  55  88
5  65  50  27  70  76  90  87  61
6  48  93  44  65  24  46  14  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the allocation maximizes the total valuation for the agents. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that no agent ends up with more than one item before others get any.

Let's analyze the allocation:

- Item 0 is most valued by agent 1 (67).
- Item 1 is most valued by agent 6 (93).
- Item 2 is most valued by agent 1 (98).
- Item 3 is most valued by agent 3 (80).
- Item 4 is most valued by agent 2 (98).
- Item 5 is most valued by agent 3 (99).
- Item 6 is most valued by agent 5 (87).
- Item 7 is most valued by agent 4 (88).

Now, we will assign these items to the respective agents:

- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 6 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets items 3 and 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 5 gets item 6.
- Agent 4 gets item 7.

Agent 0 does not get any items in this allocation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [1]
}
```
