Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  55  48  93  84  96  29  17
1  88  94  12  37  13  29  15  43
2  80   9  51  96  73  38  52  43
3  34  39  27  84  92  52  70  88
4  39  66  15  93  67  47  39  47
5  84  75  25  28  92   5  36  11
6  66  61  24  61  92  80  90  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure each agent ends up with an integer number of items. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, this means some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive none.

Let's attempt to allocate the items based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness:

1. **Agent 0**:
    - Highest valuation items: 5 (96), 3 (93)
    - Allocate item 5 and 3 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Highest valuation items: 1 (94), 0 (88)
    - Allocate item 1 and 0 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
    - Highest valuation items: 3 (96)
    - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (already allocated to Agent 0)

4. **Agent 3**:
    - Highest valuation items: 4 (92)
    - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**:
    - Highest valuation items: 3 (93)
    - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4 (already allocated to Agent 0)

6. **Agent 5**:
    - Highest valuation items: 4 (92)
    - Allocate item 4 to Agent 5 (already allocated to Agent 3)

7. **Agent 6**:
    - Highest valuation items: 6 (90)
    - Allocate item 6 to Agent 6

After reviewing the allocations and ensuring each item is allocated, the final allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [6, 2]
}
```

This ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
