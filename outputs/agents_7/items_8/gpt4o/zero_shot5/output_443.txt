Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  54  72  31  28  58  37  26
1  91  93  73  51  90  67  37   5
2  34  62  56  83  26  61  56  63
3  86   2  69  49  59  17  79  57
4  38  19  26  47   8  52   4  10
5  29   7  82  12  11   3   9  50
6  90  95  47  80  86  85  25  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we aim to distribute the items to maximize the total value across all agents, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 or 0 items. We will try to distribute the items to maximize fairness by considering each agent's values for the items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 can receive item 2 (value 72).
2. Agent 1 can receive item 1 (value 93).
3. Agent 2 can receive item 3 (value 83).
4. Agent 3 can receive item 6 (value 79).
5. Agent 4 can receive item 5 (value 52).
6. Agent 5 can receive item 7 (value 50).
7. Agent 6 can receive items 0 and 4 (values 90 and 86).

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent receives the item they value the most. Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [0, 4]
}
```
