Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  97  99  86  31  30  60  82
1  31  13  26  25  14  34  55  15
2  56  43  73  52  49  12  17  99
3  32  34  75  62  61   0  74  93
4  16  79  92  21  89  61  73  68
5  89   8  38  73  38  42  40  58
6  80  34  37  19  34  24   1  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute the items to maximize fairness, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here's a proposed allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (value 99) and item 0 (value 38), as they have high values for these items.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 6 (value 55), as it's one of the higher valuations for this agent.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 7 (value 99), as it's the highest value for this agent.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 3 (value 62), as it is one of the higher valuations.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 4 (value 89), as it is the highest valuation for this agent.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 5 (value 42), as it is among the higher valuations.
7. **Agent 6**: Allocate item 1 (value 34), which is a moderate valuation for this agent.

By following this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1]
}
```
