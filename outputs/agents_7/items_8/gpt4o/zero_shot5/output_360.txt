Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18   0  60  74  46  56  93  13
1  56  34  89  81  68  63  45  47
2  46  61  70  17  65  68  59  43
3  77   8  32  93  76  80   2  84
4  99  10  11  10  32  51  43  91
5  90  35  16  56  11  51  21  36
6  77  29  40  92  29  88  20  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated, we can look at each agent's preferences and try to maximize their satisfaction. One approach to ensure fairness is to allocate items based on the highest valuation each agent has for an item.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (valued at 93, the highest for agent 0).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (valued at 89, the highest for agent 1).
3. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (valued at 68, the highest for agent 2).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3 (valued at 93, the highest for agent 3).
5. Assign item 0 to agent 4 (valued at 99, the highest for agent 4).
6. Assign item 1 to agent 5 (valued at 35, highest for agent 5 among unallocated items).
7. Assign item 7 to agent 6 (valued at 88, highest for agent 6 among unallocated items).
8. Finally, assign item 4 to agent 1 (valued at 68, a high preference for agent 1 and unallocated).

The allocations can be represented in the required JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to only one agent and each agent gets an integer number of items while considering their preferences.
