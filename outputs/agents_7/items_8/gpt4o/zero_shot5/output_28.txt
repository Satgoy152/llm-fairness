Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  36  29  77  93  45  60  98
1   2  58  70  10   4  17  24  18
2  87  86  89  66  14  97  34  29
3  45  25  37  11  28  91  22  33
4   4  24  98  41  50  44  64  49
5  36  10  93   8  83  19  96  48
6  23  39  36  23  58  40  39  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given there are 7 agents and 8 items, most agents will receive one item, and one agent will receive two items. Here is a possible fair allocation:

1. Calculate the highest value for each item across all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Following these steps, here is how the allocation might work:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it highest at 93.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it highest at 86.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it highest at 98.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it highest at 77.
- Item 4: Agent 5 values it highest at 83.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it highest at 97.
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it highest at 96.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it highest at 98.

Now, let's distribute these items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and redistribute if necessary:

- Assign items 0, 3, and 7 to agent 0.
- Assign items 1 and 5 to agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to agent 4.
- Assign item 4 to agent 5.
- Assign item 6 to agent 6.

This way, each agent gets at least one item except for agents 1 and 3, who get none. We need to revise the list to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated equals 8.

Let’s adjust this to ensure fairness:

- Assign items 0 and 3 to agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to agent 4.
- Assign item 4 to agent 5.
- Assign item 6 to agent 6.
- Assign item 7 to agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to agent 3.

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item.

Here’s the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [6]
}
```
