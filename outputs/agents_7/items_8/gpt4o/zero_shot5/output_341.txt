Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  13  75  60  14  94  51  46
1  43  25  34  62  29  37  40  70
2  88  31  29   9  52  94  67  82
3  47   7  17  76   9  17  87  82
4  77  22  63  52  45   9  56  96
5  74  52  91  42   4  88  18  33
6  75  79  44  76  26  54  98  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple approach to balance the total value each agent receives. This will ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on the values given in the table. We'll try to distribute the items so that the total value received by each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's first evaluate the total value for each agent if they were to receive each item, then distribute the items accordingly.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [5]
- Agent 1: Items [3]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [6]
- Agent 4: Items [2]
- Agent 5: Items [1]
- Agent 6: Items [4]

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives based on their individual valuations of the items.
