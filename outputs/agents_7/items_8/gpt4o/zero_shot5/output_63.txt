Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  96  73  57  16  57  25  87
1   5  41   6  35  91  96  21  55
2  77  99  29   7  19  35  58  52
3  66  26  29   3  58  98  54  67
4  81  16  18  61  14  92  21  30
5  50  86   7  56  63  45  20  74
6  43   0  19   9  17  42  19  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item. We can use a simple greedy algorithm to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Let's go through the process of allocation:

1. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:**

   - Item 0: Agent 4 values it at 81 (highest among all agents).
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 99.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 73.
   - Item 3: Agent 4 values it at 61.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 91.
   - Item 5: Agent 3 values it at 98.
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 58.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 87.

2. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item:**

   After the initial allocation, we have:
   - Agent 0: [2, 7]
   - Agent 1: [4]
   - Agent 2: [1, 6]
   - Agent 3: [5]
   - Agent 4: [0, 3]
   - Agent 5: []
   - Agent 6: []

   We need to reallocate some items to cover agents 5 and 6:
   
   Let's take item 6 from agent 2 and give it to agent 5, as agent 5 values it at 20, which isn't too far off.
   Let's take item 3 from agent 4 and give it to agent 6, as agent 6 values it at 9.

   Now, the allocation is:
   - Agent 0: [2, 7]
   - Agent 1: [4]
   - Agent 2: [1]
   - Agent 3: [5]
   - Agent 4: [0]
   - Agent 5: [6]
   - Agent 6: [3]

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [3]
}
```
