Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  10  47   8  91  28  23  29
1  42   0  47  29  35  50  96  79
2  70  70  94  51  82  78  21  70
3  23  97  43  19  15  24  23  30
4   2  34  78  33   9  20   4  33
5  14  64  24  20  75  84  42   8
6  71  79  72  78  67  70  76  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. However, since there are only 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will inevitably receive two items while others will receive one each. We'll use a rough approach to ensure fairness by considering each agent's highest-valued items and distributing items accordingly.

Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is item 4 (value 91).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is item 6 (value 96).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is item 2 (value 94).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is item 1 (value 97).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item is item 2 (value 78), but it is already taken by Agent 2. Next highest is item 1 (value 34), but it's already taken by Agent 3. Next is item 3 (value 33).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value item is item 5 (value 84).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value item is item 3 (value 78), but it's already taken by Agent 4. Next highest is item 1 (value 79), but it's already taken by Agent 3. Next is item 6 (value 76), but it's already taken by Agent 1. Next is item 7 (value 74).

Now we need to allocate one more item since there are 8 items and only 7 have been allocated. We'll give it to the agent who would benefit the most from an additional item.

- **Agent 6**: The remaining items are 0 and 5. Agent 6 has the highest value for item 0 (value 71) among the remaining choices.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [7, 0]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and Agent 6, who had no particularly high-value items initially, receives two items to balance the allocation.
