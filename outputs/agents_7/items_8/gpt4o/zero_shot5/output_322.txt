Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  70  61   5  49  24  84  33
1  82  24  62  95  46  76  59  13
2  53   7  68   1   1  61  15  59
3  70  70  81  60  38  67  68  28
4  62  66  82  43  44  68  77  87
5  69  22  80  93   1  38  87   2
6  51  84  80  13  31  60  33  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent gets at least one item, and the total value of the items allocated to each agent is reasonably balanced. One approach is to assign the items based on maximizing the individual agent's valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and no items are left unallocated.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign the item they value the highest which is item 6 (value 84).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign the item they value the highest which is item 3 (value 95).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign the item they value the highest which is item 2 (value 68).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign the item they value the highest which is item 2. However, since item 2 is already taken, allocate their next best, item 0 (value 70).
5. **Agent 4**: Assign the item they value the highest which is item 7 (value 87).
6. **Agent 5**: Assign the item they value the highest which is item 3. However, since item 3 is already taken, allocate their next best, item 6 (value 87). But since item 6 is also taken, allocate item 2 (value 80).
7. **Agent 6**: Assign the item they value the highest which is item 1 (value 84).

Next, we ensure all agents receive at least one item and balance the allocation:

- Re-evaluate and adjust some allocations to ensure all items are distributed and each receives at least one item. 

Here's a balanced allocation strategy:

- Agent 0: [0, 5]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [7]
- Agent 5: [4]
- Agent 6: [1]

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [1]
}
```
