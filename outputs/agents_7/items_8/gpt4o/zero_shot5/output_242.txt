Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  97  66  35   0  49   1   1
1  21  70  76  36  70  71  66  86
2  83  23  12  42  50  11  94  21
3  61  91  55  56  40  54  43  63
4  58  60  41  83  20   7  19  99
5  64  53  80  75   0   5  95  63
6  21  86  23  14  91   3  93  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the preferences and ensure a fair distribution. Here's a potential allocation strategy based on maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive:

1. Calculate the highest valued item for each agent.
2. Allocate items based on maximizing the total benefit, ensuring no item is allocated more than once and each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 1, so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 7, so allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 6, so allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 1, but it's already taken, so allocate item 3 (next highest) to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 highly values item 7, but it's already taken, so allocate item 3 (next highest) to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 highly values item 6, but it's already taken, so allocate item 2 (next highest) to Agent 5.
- Agent 6 highly values item 4, so allocate item 4 to Agent 6.

Let's make sure each agent gets an item:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 3
- Agent 5: Item 2
- Agent 6: Item 4

There are still items 5 left, which has to be assigned to an agent such that each agent gets an integer number of items. Allocate it to Agent 5 to balance out the distribution.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2, 5],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and no item is allocated more than once.
