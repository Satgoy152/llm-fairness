Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  33  92  55  95  89  59  77
1  71   1  56   9  75  83  74  79
2  73  80  35   9  42  67  65  36
3  37  23  58  37  89  99  59  17
4  67  22  24  97  58  19  72  13
5  15  15   6  67  97  69  97  76
6  79  29  37  29  19  80  32  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I will aim to balance the value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others receive 1 item each. I will select allocations that maximize the total value for each agent as much as possible.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives item 4 (value = 95)
2. **Agent 1**: Receives item 5 (value = 83)
3. **Agent 2**: Receives item 1 (value = 80)
4. **Agent 3**: Receives item 3 (value = 37)
5. **Agent 4**: Receives item 6 (value = 72)
6. **Agent 5**: Receives items 2 and 7 (values = 6, 76)
7. **Agent 6**: Receives item 0 (value = 79)

These allocations ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated. Below is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2, 7],
    "6": [0]
}
```
