Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  39  52  24   5  66  19  73
1  94  19  11  49  18  97  61  15
2  52  81  14  57  33   0  18  16
3  48   9  74  91  35  28  43  36
4  16  74  11  44  51  37  22  66
5  26  79  66  96  19  99  20  70
6  42  60  45   8  24  45  56  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Since there are only 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one each.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** gets item 7 (value 73).
2. **Agent 1** gets item 5 (value 97).
3. **Agent 2** gets item 1 (value 81).
4. **Agent 3** gets item 3 (value 91).
5. **Agent 4** gets item 4 (value 51).
6. **Agent 5** gets items 2 and 6 (values 66 and 20).
7. **Agent 6** gets item 0 (value 42).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2, 6],
    "6": [0]
}
```
