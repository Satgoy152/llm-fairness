Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  30  85  88  13  92  23  46
1  27  24  46   1   7  16  52  31
2  69  28  65  48  60  78  12  34
3  56  52  99  36  37  58  53   3
4  39  98  73  21  46  59  90  37
5  15  99  79  40  78  42  59  10
6  93  70  83  48  91  76  54  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[34 30 85 88 13 92 23 46]
 [27 24 46  1  7 16 52 31]
 [69 28 65 48 60 78 12 34]
 [56 52 99 36 37 58 53  3]
 [39 98 73 21 46 59 90 37]
 [15 99 79 40 78 42 59 10]
 [93 70 83 48 91 76 54 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy approach to maximize the fairness, which can be interpreted as trying to maximize the total value each agent receives. Given that we have 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 6** has the highest valuation for item 0 (93), so let's allocate item 0 to agent 6.
2. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 1 (99), so let's allocate item 1 to agent 5.
3. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 2 (99), so let's allocate item 2 to agent 3.
4. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 (88), so let's allocate item 3 to agent 0.
5. **Agent 4** has a relatively high valuation for item 4 (46), so let's allocate item 4 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 5 (92), but since agent 0 already has item 3, we'll consider the next highest valuation. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 5 (78), so let's allocate item 5 to agent 2.
7. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 6 (90), but since agent 4 already has item 4, let's consider the next highest valuation. **Agent 5** has a high valuation for item 6 (59), so let's allocate item 6 to agent 5.
8. **Agent 6** has the highest valuation for item 7 (83), but since agent 6 already has item 0, let's consider the next highest valuation. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 7 (46), but since agent 0 already has item 3, let's allocate item 7 to **Agent 1** with a valuation of 31.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 6],
    "6": [0]
}
```
