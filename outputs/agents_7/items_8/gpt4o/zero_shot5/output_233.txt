Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  74  10  25   1  32  53  72
1  26  52  37  61  31  91  42  62
2  61  40  56  90  59  96  33  80
3  32  12   3  99   2  37   2  86
4  87  54  27  20   0  60  12  21
5   2  15  54   1  63  55  68  31
6  46  42  71  19  27  27  13   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that all items are allocated. Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive 2 items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Allocate item 1 (value 74)
2. Agent 1: Allocate item 5 (value 91)
3. Agent 2: Allocate item 3 (value 90)
4. Agent 3: Allocate item 7 (value 86)
5. Agent 4: Allocate item 0 (value 87)
6. Agent 5: Allocate item 6 (value 68)
7. Agent 6: Allocate item 2 (value 71)

Since agent 0 has only one item, we allocate one more to one of the other agents. Let's choose an agent to receive another item such that their total value is maximized. Agent 1 could receive item 4 (value 31), as it is not allocated yet.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2]
}
```
