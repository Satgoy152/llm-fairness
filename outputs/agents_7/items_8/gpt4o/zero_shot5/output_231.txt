Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  97  50  99  97  77  45   4
1  92  23  17  13  25  97   8  37
2  24  27  56  73  53  91   2  59
3  13  72   0  87  14  74  29   1
4   3  17  53  34  81  97  39   9
5  65  89  57  52  33  22   7   3
6  41  99  67  13  90  26  33  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [41 99 67 13 90 26 33 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we must ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated in total. A common approach is to try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, but also ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible. Here is one way to allocate the items based on the valuations provided:

Based on the valuation table, I will allocate the items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution:

- Allocate item 1 to agent 6 (value 99)
- Allocate item 3 to agent 0 (value 99)
- Allocate item 0 to agent 1 (value 92)
- Allocate item 5 to agent 2 (value 91)
- Allocate item 4 to agent 6 (value 90)
- Allocate item 7 to agent 6 (value 75)
- Allocate item 2 to agent 5 (value 57)
- Allocate item 6 to agent 4 (value 39)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent is considered for at least one item based on maximizing their individual values. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [1, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation considers maximizing the individual agent's values while ensuring all items are assigned.
