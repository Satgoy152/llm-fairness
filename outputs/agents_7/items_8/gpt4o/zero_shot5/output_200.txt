Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2   6  38  28  25  58  98  89
1   1  33  28  78   2  20  34  33
2   2  38  18  89  74  74  61  16
3  23   2  11  79  77  23  80  25
4  28   8  84  22  32   2  55  32
5  12  63  53  26  41  95  18  16
6  62  52   7  90  99  64  62  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we should consider the valuations of each agent for the items. A common approach is to allocate items such that the total value (or satisfaction) is maximized while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value 98).
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 78).
3. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 74).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 3 (value 77).
5. Assign item 2 to agent 4 (value 84).
6. Assign item 1 to agent 5 (value 63).
7. Assign item 7 to agent 6 (value 10).
8. Assign item 0 to agent 6 as well (value 62).

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, and the total value is distributed among the agents based on their valuations.

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [7, 0]
}
```
