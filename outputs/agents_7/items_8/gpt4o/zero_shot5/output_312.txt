Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  76  98  12  54  39  49  94
1  98  96  66  73  50  97  68  44
2   8  94  31  79  74  40  61  50
3  59  59  56  69  87  43  49  45
4  40  41  50  52  26  32  78  24
5  40   0  19  14  18  77  94  59
6  99  11  36  55  12   0  48  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to use the "maximum marginal utility" method, where each item is given to the agent who values it the most. This approach ensures that each item goes to the agent who derives the maximum benefit from it. However, since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive an additional item. We'll balance this by ensuring that the agent who receives the extra item values it highly.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 99 (Agent 6)
2. Item 1: Highest value is 96 (Agent 1)
3. Item 2: Highest value is 98 (Agent 0)
4. Item 3: Highest value is 79 (Agent 2)
5. Item 4: Highest value is 87 (Agent 3)
6. Item 5: Highest value is 97 (Agent 1) [Agent 1 can receive this as an extra item since the next highest is 77 for Agent 5]
7. Item 6: Highest value is 94 (Agent 5)
8. Item 7: Highest value is 94 (Agent 0) [Agent 0 can receive this as an extra item since the next highest is 71 for Agent 6]

Now, let's distribute these items:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 7
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: Item 6
- Agent 6: Item 0

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0]
}
```
