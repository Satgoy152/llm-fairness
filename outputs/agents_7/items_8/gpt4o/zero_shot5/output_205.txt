Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4   4  76  90  52  77  18   3
1  60  67  19  79  45  66  37  13
2  93  76  16  73  76  38  52  94
3  27  89  94  82  27  11  63  41
4  45   1  10  15  82  78  79  97
5  16  88   2  76  47  77  20  14
6  19  35  43  52  65  64  41   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes the total valuation across all agents. We'll proceed by assigning items to agents based on the highest value an agent assigns to an item, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent and every agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Allocate item 3 (value 90 for agent 0).
2. Agent 1: Allocate item 1 (value 67 for agent 1).
3. Agent 2: Allocate item 0 (value 93 for agent 2).
4. Agent 3: Allocate item 2 (value 94 for agent 3).
5. Agent 4: Allocate item 7 (value 97 for agent 4).
6. Agent 5: Allocate item 5 (value 77 for agent 5).
7. Agent 6: Allocate item 4 (value 65 for agent 6).
8. Agent 1: Allocate item 6 (value 37 for agent 1).

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing the individual agent's subjective value for their allocated items.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4]
}
```
