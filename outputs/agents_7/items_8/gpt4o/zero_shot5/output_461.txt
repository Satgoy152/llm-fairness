Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  96  61  13  67  81  80  37
1  41  43   5  21  59  78  44  51
2  15  75  97  96  79  13  93  71
3  30  63  89  24  65  88  43  65
4  69  24  80  61  73   8  73  12
5  60  51  80  34  10  67  81   5
6  84  77   8   8  52  82  62  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the highest valuations for the items by each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuation: [52, 96, 61, 13, 67, 81, 80, 37]
   - Highest values are for items 1, 5, 6.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Valuation: [41, 43, 5, 21, 59, 78, 44, 51]
   - Highest values are for items 5, 4, 7.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Valuation: [15, 75, 97, 96, 79, 13, 93, 71]
   - Highest values are for items 2, 3, 6.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Valuation: [30, 63, 89, 24, 65, 88, 43, 65]
   - Highest values are for items 2, 5, 6.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Valuation: [69, 24, 80, 61, 73, 8, 73, 12]
   - Highest values are for items 0, 2, 4.

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Valuation: [60, 51, 80, 34, 10, 67, 81, 5]
   - Highest values are for items 6, 2, 5.

7. **Agent 6**: 
   - Valuation: [84, 77, 8, 8, 52, 82, 62, 49]
   - Highest values are for items 0, 1, 5.

Based on the analysis, we allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 7.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 6.
- Agent 4 gets item 0.
- Agent 5 gets item 2.
- Agent 6 gets item 4.

This ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and a total of 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [4]
}
```
