Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  91  12  81  52  45  67   4
1  36  73  59  67  44   5  25  38
2   9  76  46  54  55  90  84  23
3  52  82  50  92   4  28  15  73
4  66  14  34  26  96  25  98   0
5  39  68  56  16  25  22  44  33
6  60  10  23  79   7  91   3  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate items so that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's start by summing up the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 0 + 91 + 12 + 81 + 52 + 45 + 67 + 4 = 352
- Agent 1: 36 + 73 + 59 + 67 + 44 + 5 + 25 + 38 = 347
- Agent 2: 9 + 76 + 46 + 54 + 55 + 90 + 84 + 23 = 437
- Agent 3: 52 + 82 + 50 + 92 + 4 + 28 + 15 + 73 = 396
- Agent 4: 66 + 14 + 34 + 26 + 96 + 25 + 98 + 0 = 359
- Agent 5: 39 + 68 + 56 + 16 + 25 + 22 + 44 + 33 = 303
- Agent 6: 60 + 10 + 23 + 79 + 7 + 91 + 3 + 16 = 289

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (high value for Agent 0).
2. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (high value for Agent 2).
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 (high value for Agent 3).
4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 4 (high value for Agent 4).
5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 6 (moderate value for Agent 6).
6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (moderate value for Agent 1).
7. Allocate item 2 to Agent 5 (moderate value for Agent 5).
8. Allocate item 7 to Agent 3 (high value for Agent 3).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0]
}
```
