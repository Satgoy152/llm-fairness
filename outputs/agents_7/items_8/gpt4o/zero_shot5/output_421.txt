Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  29  43  73  84  64  14  95
1  14  97   0  26  71  14  38  17
2   9   7  22  13  98  90  93  79
3  81  50  10  93  96  71  13  41
4  39  50  76   0  99  65  98   9
5  61  37  94  47  46  28  18  89
6  64  39  27   8  80   5  35   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Since there are more agents than items, at least one agent will end up with no items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 7 (95) and item 0 (88).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (97).
3. Agent 2 values items 4 (98) and 5 (90) highly.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 3 (93).
5. Agent 4 highly values item 6 (98).
6. Agent 5 highly values item 2 (94).
7. Agent 6 has no extremely high valuations compared to others.

Let's allocate based on these observations:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2],
    "6": []
}
```
