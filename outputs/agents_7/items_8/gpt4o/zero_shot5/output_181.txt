Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  28  33  87  82  77  30  14
1  26  40  45   2   2   8  10  90
2  84  28  24  18  86   3  27   5
3   9   8  31  31  32  96  42  49
4  59  97  57  53   9  61  78   3
5  42  70  36  54  18  71   4  71
6  79  45  32  60  99  65  69  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item if possible, while also considering their valuations to ensure fairness. Since we only have 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, while the others will receive 1 item each.

Here's a possible allocation considering the valuations, trying to maximize the perceived value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 3 (value 87)
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 7 (value 90)
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 4 (value 86)
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 5 (value 96)
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 1 (value 97)
6. **Agent 5**: Prefers item 5, but it's taken; next, item 1 (value 70)
7. **Agent 6**: Prefers item 4, but it's taken; next, item 0 (value 79)

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can take item 2 (as they have the highest remaining valuation for unallocated items).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0]
}
```
