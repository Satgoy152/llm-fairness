Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  89  77  19  44   1  38  56
1  92  47  91  35  52  36  79  52
2  85  73  63  79  88   0  80  75
3  69  53  49  40  67  65  50  62
4  53  32  50  97  61  71  85  42
5  60  23  52  57  77   8  22  12
6  56  54  44  41  62  52  81  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by assigning them items they value highly. Since there are 7 agents and 8 items, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, or ensure that the overall distribution is as balanced as possible.

One approach is to start by assigning each agent the item they value the most and then distribute the remaining items based on a balanced approach. Here's how we can do it:

1. Calculate the highest value item for each agent.
2. Assign each agent their highest value item if it hasn't been assigned yet.
3. Assign the remaining items to the agents who can derive the most value from them, ensuring that all items are allocated.

Following this approach, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 1 (value: 89)
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (value: 91)
- Agent 2 gets item 4 (value: 88)
- Agent 3 gets item 0 (value: 69)
- Agent 4 gets item 3 (value: 97)
- Agent 5 gets item 5 (value: 8)
- Agent 6 gets items 6 (value: 81) and 7 (value: 30)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the remaining items are distributed to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6, 7]
}
```
