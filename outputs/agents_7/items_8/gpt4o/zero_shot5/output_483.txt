Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  75  78  47  20  70  55  40
1  98  72  80  79  14  34  39   0
2  79  60  21  47  70  43  98  40
3  60  31  61  39  67  48  22  13
4  81  73  31  69   3  37  55  97
5  31  38  12  70  67  33  44   2
6  58  91  20  32  19  62  46  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets items that maximize their preferences while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 1 (75) and item 2 (78) fairly highly compared to the other agents. We can allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a very high valuation for item 0 (98). We can allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 6 (98) the most. We can allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent has a reasonable valuation for item 3 (39). We can allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 7 (97) highly. We can allocate item 7 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 4 (67) highly compared to the other items. We can allocate item 4 to Agent 5.

7. **Agent 6**: This agent values item 5 (62) the most. We can allocate item 5 to Agent 6.

Here is the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
