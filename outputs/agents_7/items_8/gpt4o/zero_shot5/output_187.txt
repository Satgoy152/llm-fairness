Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  63  75  35  47  28  92   1
1  82  16  43  82  67  11  74  67
2  42  46  84  62  73  61  16  37
3  38  97  21   5  11  33  41   0
4  38  24  35  61  51  19  23  62
5  65  61  94  26  18  98  94  38
6  50  26   2  41  21  89   6  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we can consider using a simple "maximum value" approach, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This doesn't necessarily ensure an equal number of items for each agent, but it attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction based on given valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 82 by Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 97 by Agent 3.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 94 by Agent 5.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 82 by Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 73 by Agent 2.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 98 by Agent 5.
7. Item 6: Highest value is 92 by Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Highest value is 86 by Agent 6.

Now, we map these allocations to the agents:

- Agent 0: Item 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: (no items)
- Agent 5: Items 2, 5
- Agent 6: Item 7

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2, 5],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while all items are distributed among the agents as per the requirement.
