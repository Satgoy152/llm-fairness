Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11   1  23  36  76  99  99  88
1  33  58  44  74   8  78  54  88
2  13   8  58  46  60  80  79  80
3  72  30  60   9   1  34  40  37
4  63  31  55  51  60  33  48   3
5  43  99  90  12  84  48  67  16
6  18  86  51  17  15  25  91  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: A high preference for items 5, 6, and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: A high preference for item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: A high preference for items 5 and 6.
4. **Agent 3**: A high preference for item 0.
5. **Agent 4**: A decent preference for items 2 and 4.
6. **Agent 5**: A high preference for items 1 and 2.
7. **Agent 6**: A high preference for item 6.

Considering these preferences and ensuring each agent gets at least one item, here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [6, 7]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Item [5]
- Agent 3: Item [0]
- Agent 4: Item [4]
- Agent 5: Item [1]
- Agent 6: Item [2]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all the items are allocated. Here's the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [2]
}
```
