Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  16  86  87  63  61  88  14
1  19  14  94  79  46  80  58  90
2  50  35  35  62  19  92  27  14
3  49  86   7   4  26  41  48  51
4  27  27  48  37  82  30  35  66
5  25  58   5  70  34  84  20   1
6  24  20  86  96  42  99  95  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every agent has at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated. Given there are 8 items and 7 agents, at least one agent will receive 2 items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuation each agent has for any item.
2. Assign the highest valued item to each agent if it is still available.
3. Once each agent has one item, allocate the remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Here is a potential allocation based on the table provided:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 92 for item 0, so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 94 for item 2, so allocate item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 92 for item 5, so allocate item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation of 86 for item 1, so allocate item 1 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation of 82 for item 4, so allocate item 4 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation of 84 for item 5, but item 5 is already taken, so allocate their next highest, item 3, to agent 5.
- Agent 6 has the highest valuation of 99 for item 5, but item 5 is already taken, so allocate their next highest, item 6, to agent 6.

Now we have allocated 7 items. We need to allocate one more item to ensure all items are distributed.

- The remaining item is item 7. We can allocate it to the agent who will benefit from it the most based on their remaining valuations. Agent 1 has a high valuation of 90 for item 7, so allocate item 7 to agent 1.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [6]
}
```
