Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  45  68   2  15   8  70  38
1   7  83  13   3  31  55  67  18
2  16  30  33  94  48  37  25  57
3  57  94  54  41  39  43  96  34
4  87  89   6  81  61  40  43  71
5  15   2  68  37  26  88  91  59
6  45  58  85  86   5  59  31   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method called "maximum weighted matching" or a greedy approach. A simplified approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 72).
2. Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 83).
3. Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 94).
4. Agent 3 gets item 6 (value 96).
5. Agent 4 gets item 4 (value 61).
6. Agent 5 gets item 5 (value 88).
7. Agent 6 gets item 2 (value 85).
8. Agent 0 gets item 7 (value 38) to ensure all items are allocated.

With this allocation, each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2]
}
```
