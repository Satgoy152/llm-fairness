Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2   9  82  73  54  67   7  20
1  48  79  26  84   1  93  78  73
2  76  84  27  64  58  70  50  88
3  74  32  69  49  90  25  73  83
4  53  88  36  58  62  48  68  63
5  19  52  64  97  42  12  15  56
6  68  46  93  25  37  29  83  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. One common approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Since 8 items need to be allocated to 7 agents, one agent may receive two items, or we'll have to ensure that the allocations are as fair as possible given the constraints.

Let's allocate the items by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 76 by Agent 2.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 88 by Agent 4.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 93 by Agent 6.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 97 by Agent 5.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 90 by Agent 3.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 93 by Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Highest value is 83 by Agent 6 (second item).
8. Item 7: Highest value is 88 by Agent 2 (second item).

The allocation based on these selections is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the individual satisfaction of each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. Agent 6 and Agent 2 receive two items due to the high valuations they have for those items.
