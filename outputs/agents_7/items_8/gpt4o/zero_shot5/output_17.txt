Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  46  17  38  61   7  36  98
1   3  48  13  13  26  75  79  73
2  48  75  15   8  28  58  75  17
3   9  23  53  93  59  98  28  82
4  39  99  61  18  31  64  76  97
5  94  68  27  48  81  39   1  50
6  36  37  51  22  82  44  64  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that optimize their valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's one way to fairly allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items to the agent that values them the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives items, if possible, to maintain fairness.
3. Adjust allocations to meet the requirement that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Based on the provided table, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most, let's assign it to them.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most, let's assign it to them.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most, let's assign it to them.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most, let's assign it to them.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most, but since it's already allocated, let's assign item 4 to them.
- Agent 5 values item 0 the most, let's assign it to them.
- Agent 6 values item 4 the most, but since it's already allocated, let's assign item 6 to them.
- The remaining item, item 2, can be assigned to agent 4 as they value it second highest.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6]
}
```
