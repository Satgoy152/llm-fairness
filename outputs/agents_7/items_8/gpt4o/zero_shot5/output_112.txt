Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  53  39  84  60  43   0  68
1  32  82   8  81   7  67  31   4
2  97  90  55  16  87  58  56  63
3  47  86  27  32  24   1  55  10
4  10  63  46  34  34  41  72  11
5  65  49  53  65  27  78  31  76
6  29  79  82  81  35  76  95  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [32 82  8 81  7 67 31  4]

 [29 79 82 81 35 76 95 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to each agent, we should attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

Here's one potential allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value 97).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value 82).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 6 (value 82).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 84).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (value 87).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 5 (value 78).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 6 (value 95).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 0 (value 68).

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with items that offer them the most value, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2, 6]
}
```
