Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  30  25  21   2   6  66  20
1   8  40  62  71  90   8  86  63
2  26  14  33  26  22  23   9   5
3  86  79  53  12  98  45  67   1
4   9  30  79  49  22   2  31  41
5  64  63   9  49  29  82  79  10
6  98  87  99   0  10  64  72  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. This is a common approach to fair division problems.

Let's examine the valuations and allocate items to the agents:

1. First, we will assign items to the agent who values them the most.
2. If an agent has already received an item, we'll consider their remaining highest value item that hasn't been allocated yet.

Here is the step-by-step allocation process:

- Agent 6 values item 2 the most (99), so we assign item 2 to Agent 6.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most (98), so we assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Agent 6 values item 0 the second most (98), so we assign item 0 to Agent 6.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (71), so we assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 6 the most (66), so we assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- Agent 5 values item 5 the most (82), so we assign item 5 to Agent 5.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the second most (63), so we assign item 7 to Agent 1.
- Agent 5 values item 1 the second most (63), so we assign item 1 to Agent 5.

Now, each item is allocated, and each agent has received items based on their valuations. 

Finally, presenting the allocation as requested:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 5],
    "6": [0, 2]
}
```
