Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  81   8  87  59  72   2  46
1  16  28  36  18  73  56  41  77
2  28  76  69  58  56  72  11  13
3  87  67  16  49  68   0  97  36
4  56  35   1  30  59  63  81  54
5  80  35  68  58  27  38  59   6
6  61  57  55  15  93  45  72  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we need to consider a balancing approach. The goal is to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze and distribute the items based on the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: [3] (Value: 87)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: [4, 7] (Values: 73, 77)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: [1] (Value: 76)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: [6] (Value: 97)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Items: [5] (Value: 63)

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Items: [0] (Value: 80)

7. **Agent 6**:
   - Items: [2] (Value: 55)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the overall distribution is somewhat balanced based on the given valuations.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [2]
}
```
