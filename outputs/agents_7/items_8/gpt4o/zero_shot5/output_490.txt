Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  55  66  19  16  45  39  66
1  27  81  37  31  17  56  53  57
2  19  46  20  85  11  64  97  64
3  71   0  82  44  60  14  37  72
4  30  76  60   9  77  76  52  18
5  26  13  98  60  16  43  59  56
6  22  45  11  52  54  34  16  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring a balanced distribution of items among the agents. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, while the rest will receive 1 item each.

Let's create an allocation where the items are distributed based on the highest valuation by each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

- Agent 0: Highest valuation is for item 2 (66).
- Agent 1: Highest valuation is for item 1 (81).
- Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 6 (97).
- Agent 3: Highest valuation is for item 0 (71).
- Agent 4: Highest valuation is for item 4 (77).
- Agent 5: Highest valuation is for item 2 (98), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 3 (60).
- Agent 6: Highest valuation is for item 4 (54), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 7 (55).

After assigning one item to each agent based on their highest valuations, we need to allocate one more item to one of the agents. We will select an agent who has a relatively high valuation for another available item compared to others.

Considering the remaining items (5), we can assign it to the agent with the highest remaining valuation for it:
- Agent 0: 45 for item 5
- Agent 1: 56 for item 5 (highest)
- Agent 2: 64 for item 5
- Agent 3: 14 for item 5
- Agent 4: 76 for item 5 (already allocated)
- Agent 5: 43 for item 5
- Agent 6: 34 for item 5

Agent 2 has the highest remaining valuation for item 5 among those not yet fully allocated, so we assign item 5 to Agent 2.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [7]
}
```
