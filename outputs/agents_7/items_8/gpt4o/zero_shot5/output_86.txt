Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  38  25  67  69  14  78  61
1  72  85  68  72  75  63  64  89
2  69  18  61  83  71  26  79  81
3  47  11  67  17  57  98  73  74
4  99  99  78  32  64  21  28  46
5  18  63  16  17  32  62  51  34
6  24  27  67   9  50  47  95  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that balances the total valuations each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 451
- Agent 1: 588
- Agent 2: 488
- Agent 3: 444
- Agent 4: 467
- Agent 5: 293
- Agent 6: 396

Now, let's allocate items based on these valuations, trying to distribute items such that the total valuation for the items each agent receives is as balanced as possible:

1. Assign items to agents prioritizing their highest valuations first, ensuring fairness and that each agent gets a chance to have high-value items.
2. Reassign if necessary to balance the total valuation among agents.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 2] (Total valuation: 124)
- Agent 1 gets items: [1, 7] (Total valuation: 174)
- Agent 2 gets items: [3, 6] (Total valuation: 162)
- Agent 3 gets item: [5] (Total valuation: 98)
- Agent 4 gets item: [4] (Total valuation: 64)
- Agent 5 gets no items: [] (Total valuation: 0)
- Agent 6 gets item: [6] (Total valuation: 95)

Re-evaluating to ensure all 8 items are assigned and the total valuation is balanced:

Adjust the allocation as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 5] (Total valuation: 113)
- Agent 1 gets items: [1, 7] (Total valuation: 174)
- Agent 2 gets items: [3, 6] (Total valuation: 162)
- Agent 3 gets item: [4] (Total valuation: 57)
- Agent 4 gets item: [2] (Total valuation: 78)
- Agent 5 gets no items: [] (Total valuation: 0)
- Agent 6 gets no items: [] (Total valuation: 0)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and all 8 items are distributed. Here's the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```
