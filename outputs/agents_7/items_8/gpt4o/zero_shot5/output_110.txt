Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  52  82  61  77   3  73  81
1  10  35  93  32  85  81  30  62
2   0  34  99  23  18  22  79  36
3  91  74  40  98  86  55  94  76
4  44  38  85  94  11  98  11  82
5  18  20  72   9  94  78   8  81
6  79  67  56  42  24   8  42  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we will attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives. The goal is to ensure that each item is allocated to exactly one agent, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, without exceeding the total number of items each agent can receive.

Let's evaluate the values and allocate accordingly:

- Item 0 has the highest value with agent 3 (value 91).
- Item 1 has the highest value with agent 3 (value 74).
- Item 2 has the highest value with agent 2 (value 99).
- Item 3 has the highest value with agent 3 (value 98).
- Item 4 has the highest value with agent 5 (value 94).
- Item 5 has the highest value with agent 4 (value 98).
- Item 6 has the highest value with agent 3 (value 94).
- Item 7 has the highest value with agent 0 (value 81).

Now, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, while keeping allocations fair.

Let's ensure each agent receives at least one item where possible:

- Agent 0: Item 7
- Agent 1: Item 2 (after reallocating from agent 2, who can take another top item)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (after reallocating from agent 3, who has multiple high-value options)
- Agent 3: Item 0, Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 5
- Agent 5: Item 4
- Agent 6: Item 3 (after reallocating from agent 3)

Now, here's a possible allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [3]
}
```
