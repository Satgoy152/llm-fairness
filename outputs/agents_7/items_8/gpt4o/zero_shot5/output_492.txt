Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  65   6  69  73  92  77  79
1  59  89  71  18  64  85  36  68
2  98   8  49  24  26  74   5   8
3  44  96  78  18   0  48  88  87
4  64  70  84  57  61  65  81  53
5  98  22  72   3  33  17  84  22
6   3  17  47  53  77  11  87  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 65  6 69 73 92 77 79]
 [59 89 71 18 64 85 36 68]
 [98  8 49 24 26 74  5  8]

 [98 22 72  3 33 17 84 22]
 [ 3 17 47 53 77 11 87 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them such that each agent receives items they value highly, ensuring a balanced distribution of overall satisfaction. Let's perform the allocation considering the values each agent has for the items.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (92), Item 7 (79)
   - Allocate: Items 5, 7

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (89), Item 5 (85)
   - Allocate: Items 1, 6 

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (98)
   - Allocate: Item 0

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (96)
   - Allocate: Item 3

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (84)
   - Allocate: Item 2

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (98)
   - Allocate: Item 4

7. **Agent 6**:
   - Highest values: Item 7 (98)
   - Allocate: Item 7

Now, check if each agent received items, and only 8 items are allocated in total.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4],
    "6": []
}
```
