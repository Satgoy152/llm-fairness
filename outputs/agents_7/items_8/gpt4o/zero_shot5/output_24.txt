Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  27  53  57  76  90  67  67
1  61  35  94  58  90  61  50  93
2  74  91  89  75  46  11  19  89
3  11  53  84  75  20  10  72  98
4  21  45  90  26  32  11  66  78
5  35  38  37  16  31  55  95  72
6  70  41  12  22  31  30  76  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item or as close to equal distribution as possible given the constraints. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent by considering their preferences.

Here's one possible allocation based on the values:

- Assign item 5 to agent 0, because agent 0 values it highly at 90.
- Assign item 1 to agent 2, because agent 2 values it highly at 91.
- Assign item 7 to agent 3, because agent 3 values it highly at 98.
- Assign item 2 to agent 4, because agent 4 values it highly at 90.
- Assign item 6 to agent 5, because agent 5 values it highly at 95.
- Assign item 0 to agent 6, because agent 6 values it highly at 70.

Now, we have two items left (items 3 and 4) and need to allocate them to the agents who already have fewer items:

- Assign item 4 to agent 1, because agent 1 values it highly at 90.
- Assign item 3 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it at 58, which is reasonable.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total of 8 items is distributed.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0]
}
```
