Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  22  67  60  32  15  26  70
1  31  48  88  29  70  45  83  33
2  93   2  64  93  61  36  64  38
3  97  47  27  44  25   6  19  38
4   4  74  61   1  97  52  75  19
5   1  93  88  53  30   3  74  15
6  27  27   8  73  80  66  77  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and a total of 8 items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 3 (value 97).
2. **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 5 (value 93).
3. **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 88).
4. **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 2 (value 93).
5. **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 4 (value 97).
6. **Item 5**: Assign to Agent 6 (value 66).
7. **Item 6**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 83).
8. **Item 7**: Assign to Agent 0 (value 70).

This allocation ensures that all agents have the opportunity to receive items based on their highest individual valuations, and every item is allocated.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [5]
}
```
