Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  68  43   6  91  75   5  34
1  28  64  78  30  55  79  69  18
2  36  79  39  59  37  24  75  28
3  36  19  77   0  11   6  17  23
4  95  57  99  76  66  18  89   9
5  86  50  67  92  24  89  31  82
6  64  45  30  27  86  41  58  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 68 43  6 91 75  5 34]
 [28 64 78 30 55 79 69 18]
 [36 79 39 59 37 24 75 28]
 [36 19 77  0 11  6 17 23]

 [86 50 67 92 24 89 31 82]
 [64 45 30 27 86 41 58 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the total value of the assigned items as evenly as possible among the agents. Here's one way to do this:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent.
2. Assign items to each agent such that the total value of items for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's perform the allocation:

| Agent | Total Value |
|-------|-------------|
| 0     | 421         |
| 1     | 421         |
| 2     | 377         |
| 3     | 189         |
| 4     | 509         |
| 5     | 521         |
| 6     | 404         |

Now we allocate the items to try to balance these totals:

- Agent 5 gets item 3 (value 92) and item 5 (value 89). Total: 181
- Agent 4 gets item 2 (value 99) and item 6 (value 89). Total: 188
- Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 99). Total: 99
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 64). Total: 64
- Agent 6 gets item 4 (value 86). Total: 86
- Agent 2 gets item 7 (value 28). Total: 28

Each item should be assigned to one agent, and the total number of items assigned is 8.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2, 6],
    "5": [3, 5],
    "6": [4]
}
```
