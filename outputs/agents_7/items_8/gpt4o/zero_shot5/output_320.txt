Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  57  67  74  67   3  37  13
1  51  44  73  39  22  81  99  62
2  21  29  44  60  59  46  37  78
3  20   9  52  15  68  61   6  42
4  35  87  51  13  36   0  69  87
5  95  48  65  29  42  77  64   2
6  88  30  14  79  58  60  84  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[52 57 67 74 67  3 37 13]
 [51 44 73 39 22 81 99 62]
 [21 29 44 60 59 46 37 78]
 [20  9 52 15 68 61  6 42]
 [35 87 51 13 36  0 69 87]
 [95 48 65 29 42 77 64  2]
 [88 30 14 79 58 60 84 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. One possible approach could involve trying to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that allocations are as balanced as possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would receive for each possible allocation.
2. Assign the items to agents such that the total valuation is maximized while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Based on the table, here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0, 5],
    "6": [2]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 0 gets item 3, which they value at 74.
- Agent 1 gets item 6, which they value at 99.
- Agent 2 gets item 7, which they value at 78.
- Agent 3 gets item 4, which they value at 68.
- Agent 4 gets item 1, which they value at 87.
- Agent 5 gets items 0 and 5, which they value at 95 and 77 respectively.
- Agent 6 gets item 2, which they value at 14.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent gets an integer number of items.
