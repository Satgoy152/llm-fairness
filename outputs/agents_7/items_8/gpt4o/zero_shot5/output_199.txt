Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  32  13  35  33  61  16  90
1  34  98  48  72  62  44  20  74
2  51  46  37  89  66  42  15   9
3  14  28  78  82  10  83   2  47
4  61  14  82  31   4  54  73  20
5  70  76  76  91  70   8  54  69
6  85  30   4  86  87  99  34   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we need to consider the valuations such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total allocation covers all 8 items. One approach is to maximize the total valuation by allocating each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's determine the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 6 values it the most at 85.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most at 98.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it the most at 78.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 5 values it the most at 91.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 6 values it the most at 87.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 6 values it the most at 99.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the most at 73.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most at 90.

Now, let's summarize the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [0, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, and all 8 items are allocated.
