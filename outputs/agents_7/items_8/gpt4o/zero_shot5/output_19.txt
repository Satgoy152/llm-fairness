Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  52  12  91   1  13  89   2
1  39  66  19  91  53  41  92  96
2  10   8  46  33  89   3  71  40
3  92  10  99  72  18  62  99  98
4  35  59  26  63  30  36  90  13
5  67  22  43  39  49  94   9  15
6  24  76  28  91  49  21  20  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. An equitable distribution can be achieved by allocating items in such a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction (or total valuation) for all agents, while ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive 2 items, and the rest will receive 1 item each.

Here's one potential allocation strategy based on maximizing individual valuations:

1. Identify the highest individual valuations for each agent.
2. Distribute items based on these highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
3. The agent with the second-highest individual valuation can receive a second item if necessary.

Let's apply this strategy:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (91).
- Agent 1 highly values item 7 (96).
- Agent 2 highly values item 4 (89).
- Agent 3 highly values item 2 (99).
- Agent 4 highly values item 6 (90).
- Agent 5 highly values item 5 (94).
- Agent 6 highly values item 1 (76).

These assignments cover all 7 agents with their highest-valued items. For the eighth item, we'll look at which agent has the next highest unused valuation:

- Agent 3 also values item 6 highly (99), but since item 6 is already assigned, we look at their next highest available valuation, which is item 7 (98).

Assign item 7 to agent 3 as well, as it is their next highest valuation and is still unallocated.

Thus, the allocation of items is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives their highest-valued item and one agent receives an additional item based on their next highest available valuation.
