Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  57  46  10  26  61  45  39
1  78  49  62  44   4  85  34  15
2  11  19  34  51  28  41  13  35
3  99  40  41  26  66  33   4  74
4  63   9  93  94  42  97  51  56
5  91  40  59  37  88  36  27  82
6  71  93  83  45   5  49  54  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. We'll aim to allocate items in such a way that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring fairness.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 5.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.
- Agent 3 receives item 0.
- Agent 4 receives item 6.
- Agent 5 receives item 4.
- Agent 6 receives items 1 and 7.

This allocation ensures every agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 8. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [1, 7]
}
```
