Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  66   5  42   0   4  57  65
1  88  64  82  80  20  29   1   2
2  16   2  25  16  64  65  70  14
3  40  90  44   0  62   1  91  89
4  88  56  39  85  81  27  53  92
5  69  27  75  42  42  17  92   2
6  20  80  36  97  91  64  32  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90 66  5 42  0  4 57 65]
 [88 64 82 80 20 29  1  2]
 [16  2 25 16 64 65 70 14]
 [40 90 44  0 62  1 91 89]
 [88 56 39 85 81 27 53 92]
 [69 27 75 42 42 17 92  2]
 [20 80 36 97 91 64 32 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item, and the total value of the items allocated to each agent is reasonably balanced. Here's a possible allocation strategy based on the provided valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocated item 0 (value = 90)
2. **Agent 1**: Allocated items 2 (value = 82) and 3 (value = 80)
3. **Agent 2**: Allocated item 5 (value = 65)
4. **Agent 3**: Allocated item 6 (value = 91)
5. **Agent 4**: Allocated item 7 (value = 92)
6. **Agent 5**: Allocated item 1 (value = 27)
7. **Agent 6**: Allocated item 4 (value = 91)

This allocation gives each agent a reasonably fair share based on the items' valuations. Now, here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [4]
}
```
