Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  40  28   4  51  19  57  28
1  87  82  50  15  75   9  31  36
2  33  17  62  99  14  80  88  44
3  86  94   2  81  64  44  87  93
4   6  42  10  84  93  58  17  60
5  19  34  94  40  31  96  58  71
6  39  54  25  70  10  26  75  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent gets items of approximately equal total valuation. This is a challenging problem often referred to as the "fair division" or "cake-cutting" problem. To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a simple heuristic approach by iteratively assigning the most valuable unassigned item to the agent who would benefit the most from it, ensuring each agent gets at least one item until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Initial Setup**: We'll start by considering the total value each agent has for all items and aim to balance these values across agents.

2. **Iterative Allocation**: We'll assign items one by one, always choosing the item that maximizes the total valuation for the agent receiving it, until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 94)
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 82)
- Agent 3 gets item 7 (value 93)
- Agent 5 gets item 5 (value 96)
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 99)
- Agent 4 gets item 4 (value 93)
- Agent 6 gets item 6 (value 75)
- Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 28) - since they have the lowest total value after initial distribution

Now, let's format this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6]
}
```
