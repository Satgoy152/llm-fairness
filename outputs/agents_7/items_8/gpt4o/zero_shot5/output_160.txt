Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  10  16  43  43  34  73  40
1  64  59  24  14  44   2  41  69
2  59  64  44  70   3  11  64  71
3  38  39  76  73  61  17  44  23
4  61  15  62   2  76  74  67  90
5  63  96  75  48  42  27  55  39
6  93  18  83  80  39  22  28  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to agents, we aim to distribute the items based on the valuations provided in the table, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated. Given the goal of fairness and the need to consider each agent's preferences, we can use the following approach:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each item is allocated once.
2. If there are ties in valuation, break them by considering the total number of items each agent currently has or by choosing randomly among tied agents.

Let's allocate the items based on the provided valuations:

- Item 0: Valued highest by Agent 6 (93)
- Item 1: Valued highest by Agent 5 (96)
- Item 2: Valued highest by Agent 6 (83)
- Item 3: Valued highest by Agent 2 (70)
- Item 4: Valued highest by Agent 4 (76)
- Item 5: Valued highest by Agent 4 (74)
- Item 6: Valued highest by Agent 0 and 2 (73 each) - allocate to Agent 0 to balance distribution.
- Item 7: Valued highest by Agent 4 (90)

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 gets item [6].
- Agent 1 gets no items [].
- Agent 2 gets item [3].
- Agent 3 gets no items [].
- Agent 4 gets items [4, 5, 7].
- Agent 5 gets item [1].
- Agent 6 gets items [0, 2].

Now, here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4, 5, 7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items, while considering each agent's preferences.
