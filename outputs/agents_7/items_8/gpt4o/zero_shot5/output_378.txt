Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8   1  91  16  11  63  23  59
1  11  33  17  37   0  90  33  17
2  95  27  77  57  45  29  49  94
3  30  99  77  76  61  53  20  99
4  42  16  85  85  73   9  35  22
5  29   0  12  92  59  77  99  71
6  74  90  85  70  67  35  74  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we aim to distribute the total number of items (8 in this case) as evenly as possible while considering their valuations. Each agent should receive approximately the same number of items, with the possibility of some receiving one more than others due to the indivisibility of items.

Let's proceed with a simple allocation strategy by focusing on maximizing the total value each agent receives from their allocated items:

1. Agent 0: Items [2, 5] (Values: 91, 63)
2. Agent 1: Item [1] (Value: 33)
3. Agent 2: Item [0] (Value: 95)
4. Agent 3: Item [7] (Value: 99)
5. Agent 4: Item [3] (Value: 85)
6. Agent 5: Item [6] (Value: 99)
7. Agent 6: Item [4] (Value: 67)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is as fair as possible based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [4]
}
```
