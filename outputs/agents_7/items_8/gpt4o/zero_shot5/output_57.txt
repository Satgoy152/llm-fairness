Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60   2  32   6  44  77  20  57
1  88   5  39  10  27  51  91  40
2  30  85  21  56  81  93  50  15
3  99  87  39  25  81  85  10  37
4  62  63  94  74  71  69  30  92
5   2  36  67  33  87  28  94  71
6  91  13  49  72  12  38  25  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the valuation each agent gets for the items they receive while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Pairings:** We start by identifying which agent values each item the highest. This helps ensure that the allocation is efficient in terms of maximizing total valuation.

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:** Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** If an agent ends up with no items, we will reallocate items to ensure every agent receives at least one item until all items are allocated.

Now, let's apply this logic to the given table and find the allocation:

- **Item 0:** Highest value is by Agent 3 (99).
- **Item 1:** Highest value is by Agent 3 (87).
- **Item 2:** Highest value is by Agent 4 (94).
- **Item 3:** Highest value is by Agent 6 (72).
- **Item 4:** Highest value is by Agent 0 (44) and Agent 3 (81), but Agent 3 already has two items, so we choose Agent 4 (71) for balance.
- **Item 5:** Highest value is by Agent 2 (93).
- **Item 6:** Highest value is by Agent 1 (91).
- **Item 7:** Highest value is by Agent 4 (92).

Based on this, here is a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [2, 7],
    "5": [],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent gets at least one item where possible (except Agent 5 in this case), maximizing the overall valuation based on the highest bids for each item.
