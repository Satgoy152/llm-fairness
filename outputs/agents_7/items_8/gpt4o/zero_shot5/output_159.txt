Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  80  27  32  68  84  57  48
1  91  43  49  30  30  78  50  69
2  57  60   9  14  45  16  87  80
3  46   9  31  82  85  36  26  10
4  65  81  65  51  58  79  53   9
5  24  53  27  48  51   8  14  78
6  75  26  14  48  40   2   4  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The table indicates the value each agent assigns to each item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most which is not already allocated.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item.
3. Adjust the allocation to ensure that all 8 items are allocated.

Based on this approach, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (highest value for agent 0)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (highest value for agent 1)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (highest value for agent 2)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (highest value for agent 3)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (highest value for agent 4)
- Agent 5: Item 7 (highest value for agent 5)
- Agent 6: Item 4 (highest value for agent 6)
- One item is unallocated and can be assigned to the agent with the next highest value (e.g., Item 2 can go to Agent 4)

Here is the resulting allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [4]
}
```
