Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  85  26  64  58  21  47  14
1  14  29   3  43  46  29  53  88
2   5  37  16  44  97  76  95  22
3  78  54  27  59  70   4  19  26
4  67  86   5  17  64  33  38  68
5  60  25  72  11  26  19  50  28
6  52  17  61  18  53  42  87   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple strategy where each agent gets an item one by one until all items are allocated. We'll try to give each agent items that are relatively valuable to them, ensuring that every agent ends up with at least one item. 

Given there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will end up with 2 items. We can prioritize giving the extra item to an agent with a low total value of items initially assigned.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign each agent one item based on their highest available valuation.
2. Distribute the remaining item to the agent with the lowest total valuation.

Let's proceed with this allocation method:

1. Agent 0: Item 0 (value 83)
2. Agent 1: Item 7 (value 88)
3. Agent 2: Item 4 (value 97)
4. Agent 3: Item 3 (value 59)
5. Agent 4: Item 1 (value 86)
6. Agent 5: Item 2 (value 72)
7. Agent 6: Item 6 (value 87)

Now, allocate the remaining item. Since agent 5 has the lowest initial total value from the first round of allocations, we assign the remaining item to agent 5:

8. Agent 5: Item 5 (value 19)

Thus, the final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2, 5],
    "6": [6]
}
```
