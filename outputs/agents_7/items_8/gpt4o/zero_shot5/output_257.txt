Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  68  54  18  39   3  32   1
1  41  19  72  77  97  28  97  43
2  46  17   8  25  49  45  36  62
3  65  28  90  64  86  51  55  39
4  24  74  94  25  71  85  54  50
5  38  43   6  48  33  33  52  60
6  22  81  24  53  53  39  49  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on the given valuations. One approach is to use a "highest-bid" or "highest-value" allocation method, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. This method ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who derives the most value from it, potentially leading to a fair distribution of items.

Let's go through each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: 
  - Highest value by agent 3 with 65.
  
- Item 1: 
  - Highest value by agent 6 with 81.
  
- Item 2: 
  - Highest value by agent 4 with 94.
  
- Item 3: 
  - Highest value by agent 1 with 77.
  
- Item 4: 
  - Highest value by agent 1 with 97.
  
- Item 5:
  - Highest value by agent 4 with 85.
  
- Item 6: 
  - Highest value by agent 1 with 97.
  
- Item 7: 
  - Highest value by agent 2 with 62.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 5],
    "5": [],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, and all 8 items are allocated.
