Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  81  64  45  60  59  51  74
1  39  95  59  67  75  41   1  64
2  22  65  86  55  72  77  16  92
3  76  20  82  85  44  98  78  73
4  67  92  42  46  59  87  31  41
5  36   9  87  83  19  50  17  18
6  20  76  65  98   3   4  88   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 1 and 7, so we can allocate those.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1, but since it's already given to Agent 0, we can allocate item 4, which is the next highest.
3. Agent 2 values item 7 the most, but since it's already taken, we can allocate item 2, which has a high value.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest, so we allocate that.
5. Agent 4 can be allocated item 0, which is one of the higher values remaining.
6. Agent 5 can receive item 3, which is quite valuable to them.
7. Agent 6 can be given item 6, which they value highly.

Following this logic, here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [6, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed. This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are relatively valuable to them, within the constraints of the table provided.
