Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  22  24  30  14  95  80  32
1  62  12  41  91  79  92  20  45
2  29   5  75  30  53  33  34  23
3  23  35  14   1  35   4   3   1
4  30  51  47  47  82   0  60  97
5  63  91   0  75  64  53  35  66
6  52  67  91  52  20  50  26  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we must consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Identify which items have the highest valuations for each agent.
2. Attempt to allocate those items to the agents who value them most.
3. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of allocated items is 8.

Following this approach, here's the allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for item 5 and item 6.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly.
- Agent 4 has high valuation for item 7.
- Agent 5 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 6 values item 2 highly, but since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 2, Agent 6 will receive other items they value moderately.

Here's one possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, and all 8 items are allocated. Note that Agent 3 receives no items, as their valuations are significantly lower compared to others in most cases.
