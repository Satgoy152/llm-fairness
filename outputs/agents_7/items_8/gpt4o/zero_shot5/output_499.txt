Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  10  91  71  36  47   9  15
1  74  86  19  95  26  59  15  84
2  65  29  59  70   4  23  10  75
3  22  48  98  12  14  18  30  81
4  17  48  42  57  20  83   6  88
5  60  42  27  24  27  94  16  35
6  95  19  28  38  22   5  91  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I will aim to maximize the total value each agent derives from the items they receive while ensuring that every item is allocated to exactly one agent. Given there are 7 agents and 8 items, not every agent will receive an item.

Here's one way to assign the items based on maximizing individual agent values:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 2 (value 91).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (value 95).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 7 (value 75).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 6 (value 30).
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 5 (value 83).
6. **Agent 5**: Assign item 4 (value 27).
7. **Agent 6**: Assign item 0 (value 95).
8. **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (value 10) to ensure all items are allocated.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [0]
}
```
