Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  63  82  78  29  79  27  82
1  70  36  16  42  49  47  13  19
2  73  19  29  47  49  45  84  15
3  38  24  55  40  51  92  17  31
4  60  12  20  48  99  37   0  19
5  92  40  27  79  68  38  48  55
6  14  91  51  53  56  96  20  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to use a round-robin allocation based on descending values, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible and preferences are considered. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. Sort the valuations for each item and assign the item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Continue assigning items to agents with the highest valuations until all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation considering the above strategy:

- Item 0: Highest value to agent 5 (92)
- Item 1: Highest value to agent 6 (91)
- Item 2: Highest value to agent 0 (82)
- Item 3: Highest value to agent 0 (78)
- Item 4: Highest value to agent 4 (99)
- Item 5: Highest value to agent 6 (96)
- Item 6: Highest value to agent 2 (84)
- Item 7: Highest value to agent 0 (82)

Now, organizing this into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 7],
    "1": [],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most, while also ensuring every agent has the opportunity to receive at least one item if possible.
