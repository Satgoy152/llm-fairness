Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  77  37   9  73  61  52   3
1  12  80  62  37  97  83  55  35
2  75  69  29  23  48  63   9  20
3  54  27  54  12  99  98  13  15
4  28  95  11  66  61  48  44  65
5  54  45  50  36  17  94  15  99
6  24  70   6  29  21  79  41  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest-value item for each agent.
2. Assign each agent their highest-value item.
3. Allocate the remaining item to an agent who would benefit the most from receiving another item.

Let's break down the process:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (73).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (97).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (75).
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (99).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (95).
- Agent 5 values item 7 the highest (99).
- Agent 6 values item 5 the highest (79).

Since item 4 is valued highest by multiple agents, let's assign it to agent 3 who has the highest valuation for it. Then, we proceed with the next highest items for the agents.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign item 1 (77). 
- Agent 1: Assign item 5 (83).
- Agent 2: Assign item 0 (75).
- Agent 3: Assign item 4 (99).
- Agent 4: Assign item 1 (as a tie with agent 0, but agent 0 already has an item, so assign item 1 to agent 4).
- Agent 5: Assign item 7 (99).
- Agent 6: Assign item 5 (79). Since item 5 is already taken by agent 1, assign item 6 (41).

Now there are still unallocated items, so let's make sure each agent gets at least one item and any leftover is reasonably assigned:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [7]
- Agent 6: [2]

This ensures all agents have at least one item. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [2]
}
```
