Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  66  71  47   7  15  62  58
1  63  79  59  91  70   8  25   5
2  76  17   9  11  55  86  49  33
3  16  19  73  86  96  45  53  45
4  47  36  53  14  55  29  25  90
5  46  60   6  92  91  87  54  49
6  20  47  22  13  59  22  43  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 66 71 47  7 15 62 58]
 [63 79 59 91 70  8 25  5]
 [76 17  9 11 55 86 49 33]
 [16 19 73 86 96 45 53 45]
 [47 36 53 14 55 29 25 90]
 [46 60  6 92 91 87 54 49]
 [20 47 22 13 59 22 43 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value. One approach is to use the "maximum value allocation," where each agent receives the item(s) for which they have the highest valuation. We need to ensure that all items are allocated and that no agent receives more than their fair share unless necessary. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
3. If an agent receives more items than others, attempt to balance the allocation by reassigning items if needed, while maintaining the highest possible valuations.

Here's an allocation based on the given table:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (99)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (79)
- Item 2: Agent 3 (73)
- Item 3: Agent 5 (92)
- Item 4: Agent 3 (96)
- Item 5: Agent 5 (87)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (62)
- Item 7: Agent 4 (90)

Now, let's format this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3, 5],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent with the highest valuation, where possible, and that all items are fairly distributed among the agents.
