Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  87  42   6  53  12   0  29
1  38  35  61  35  61  26  27  96
2  84  13  19  76  39  19  38  51
3  15   5  26  78   2  17  85  68
4  13  76  63  95  86  63  97  95
5  44  75  39  60  49  17  56  89
6  80  51  64  62  85  63  95   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the total value of items as evenly as possible among the agents, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a simple allocation approach based on maximizing individual agent values and ensuring each agent gets items:

1. Sort each agent's values for the items in descending order.
2. Allocate the highest valued available item to each agent in turn until all items are allocated.

After applying this method, here's one possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed. Note that there are multiple ways to achieve a fair distribution, and the allocation may vary based on different fairness criteria (such as maximizing the minimum value received by any agent).
