Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  40  83  36  76  99   2  65
1  11  87  47  87  23  25  72  49
2  70  91  44  19   8  99  68   3
3  35  18  86  91  45   5  31  11
4  86  46  85  53   9   3  75  12
5  89  81  67  62  27  58  49  54
6  13  35   2  61   9  29  16   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We can prioritize assigning items based on agents' highest valuations. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item first.
2. Continue assigning remaining items to agents based on their highest remaining valuation for those items, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Using this strategy, the allocation can be as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most (99), so assign item 5.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (87), so assign item 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (91), but it is taken. The next highest is item 5 (99, also taken), then item 0 (70), so assign item 0.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (91), so assign item 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most (86), but it is taken. The next highest is item 2 (85), so assign item 2.
- Agent 5 values item 0 the most (89), but it is taken. The next highest is item 1 (81, taken), then item 2 (67, taken), then item 3 (62, taken), then item 5 (58, taken), then item 4 (27), so assign item 4.
- Agent 6 values item 3 the most (61), but it is taken. The next highest is item 1 (35, taken), then items 0 (13, taken), then item 5 (29, taken), then item 6 (16), so assign item 6.

With each agent receiving one item, remaining items can be allocated to maximize overall valuation:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 0, as it has the highest remaining valuation for them (65).

Now, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
