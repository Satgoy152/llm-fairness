Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  67  83  79  95  66  73  76
1  82  32  18  14  29  70  63  41
2  75  86  20  27   5  66  38  59
3  54  19  98  15  28  63  52  35
4  59  48  36  39  17   9  90  24
5  69  17  91  96  96  83  34  60
6  77  65  74  72   9  88  75  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [82 32 18 14 29 70 63 41]
 [75 86 20 27  5 66 38 59]

 [69 17 91 96 96 83 34 60]
 [77 65 74 72  9 88 75 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method like maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. This method ensures that each agent gets items that they value highly, while also ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 0.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 6.
- Agent 5 has high valuations for items 3 and 5.
- Agent 6 has a high valuation for item 5.

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [5, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items distributed is 8. This method attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly.
