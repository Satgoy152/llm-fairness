Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  94  75  69  13  60  23  26
1  10  94  93  42  51  30   4  51
2  78  83  12  38  67  35   1  47
3  24  91   4  22  51  88  30  88
4  77  24   4  65  49  84  30  50
5  27  71  58  48  23  76  92  64
6  68  97  96  22  69  32  50   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, considering that each agent should get at least one item if possible, and all items must be allocated.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0: Allocate item 1 (value = 94)
2. Agent 1: Allocate item 2 (value = 93)
3. Agent 2: Allocate item 0 (value = 78) and item 4 (value = 67)
4. Agent 3: Allocate item 5 (value = 88)
5. Agent 4: Allocate item 3 (value = 65)
6. Agent 5: Allocate item 6 (value = 92)
7. Agent 6: Allocate item 7 (value = 9)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the items are distributed to maximize their valuation. Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [7]
}
```
