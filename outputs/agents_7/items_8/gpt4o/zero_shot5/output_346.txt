Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  51  30  36  77  63  81  27
1  81  99  60  70  67  32  36  85
2  82  27  43  72  77  81   0  72
3  32  40  40  18  18  20  97  80
4  64  38  74  95  77  16  71   8
5  82   6  68  36  13  14  99   9
6  39  50   0  24  30  42  79  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the approach of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Allocate the item with the highest valuation to each agent first, if possible.
2. Adjust the allocations to ensure each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 0 (96).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 1 (99).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 5 (81).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 6 (97).
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 3 (95).
- Agent 5 has the highest value for item 2 (68).
- Agent 6 has the highest value for item 7 (62).

With this allocation, every agent receives an item, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed among the agents.
