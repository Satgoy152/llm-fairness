Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  48  13   5  74  31  71  51
1  76  94   8  15  32   5   0  84
2  26  76  45   6  97  69  36   0
3  29  79  54  56  54  19  62  61
4  64  26  23  59  96  55  27  81
5  94  42  71  63  26  52  26  42
6  52  58  77  15  39  88  99  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to prioritize giving each agent the items they value the most while ensuring that all items are distributed and that each agent receives at least one item. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest value each agent has for an item, then moving to the next most valued item for the next agent and so on, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is for item 4 (74), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is for item 1 (94), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is for item 4 (97), but it's already taken, so we assign their next highest, item 1 (76), but it's also taken, so we assign item 5 (69).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is for item 1 (79), but it's taken, so we assign item 2 (54).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is for item 4 (96), but it's taken, so we assign item 7 (81).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for Agent 5 is for item 0 (94), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value for Agent 6 is for item 6 (99), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 6.
8. **Unallocated Items**: The only unallocated item is item 3, which will go to the agent with the least number of items or lowest value so far. We will assign item 3 to Agent 1 since it has a lower value for items allocated compared to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6]
}
```
