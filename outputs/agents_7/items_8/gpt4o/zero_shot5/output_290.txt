Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  48  80  19  85  40  64  80
1  57  76   2  42   0  71  78   0
2  74  38  55  63  61  67  86  23
3  32  47  27  40  62  32  36  37
4  37  21  90  42   6  74  53  28
5  29  40   9  88  28   7  52  99
6  42  33  59  75   0  28  56  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here is one possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest, so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 the highest, so we allocate item 6 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest, so we allocate item 4 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the highest, so we allocate item 2 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 7 the highest, so we allocate item 7 to agent 5.
7. Agent 6 values item 3 the highest, so we allocate item 3 to agent 6.

Now, we have only item 5 remaining. To allocate this, we'll look for the next highest valuation among all agents who have received fewer items. The highest valuation for item 5 that hasn't been allocated yet is from Agent 4 (74). Therefore, we allocate item 5 to agent 4.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 5],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [3]
}
```
