Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  95  77  50  83  12  84  97
1   0  50  98  72  34  49  25  60
2  75  67  32  67  99  31  45  82
3  90  68  69  29   5  76  66  70
4  57  38   2  28  72  29  37  53
5  74  71  76  72  20  54  69  47
6  88  80  81  34  97  80  74   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we aim to satisfy all agents as much as possible based on their valuations. Given the constraints, one agent will not receive an item since there are 8 items and 7 agents.

Here is one way to fairly distribute the items:

1. Assign items to agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Ensure the total number of allocations equals 8.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 the highest at 97.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 98.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 99.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest at 90.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest at 72, but since it's already taken, next is item 0 at 57.
6. Agent 5 values item 2 and item 3 equally at 76, but since item 2 is taken, they get item 3.
7. Agent 6 values item 4 the highest at 97, but since it's taken, next are items 0 and 1 at 88 and 80, respectively. Item 0 is taken, so they receive item 1.

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Item 7
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: Item 3
- Agent 6: Item 1

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [1]
}
```
