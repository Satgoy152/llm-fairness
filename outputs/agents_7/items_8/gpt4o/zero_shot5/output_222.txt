Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  55  25  63  41  17  48  97
1  50  74  13   2  66  25  50  44
2  43  76  70  71  68  61  29  45
3  41  64  32   0  89  76  68  47
4  98  41  14  27  88  58  24  36
5  55  34  64  64  70  70  41  90
6  80  60  29   0  33  14  30  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, each agent will not necessarily receive an item. We'll prioritize allocations based on highest valuations:

1. **Agent 4** values item 0 at 98, the highest valuation for any single item. Assign item 0 to Agent 4.
2. **Agent 0** values item 7 at 97, the second highest valuation. Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 at 76, and since Agent 1 also values it at 74, we'll assign it to Agent 2 to maximize their overall valuation. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 at 89. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 5** values item 5 at 70. Assign item 5 to Agent 5.
6. **Agent 6** values item 6 at 30, a lower value, but given the remaining options, it's a fair allocation. Assign item 6 to Agent 6.
7. **Agent 1** values item 2 at 13, which is their highest remaining option, and all other agents have been allocated their highest priority items. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
8. **Item 3** remains unallocated. Since Agents 3 and 5 both have equal valuations for item 3, we will assign it to Agent 5 to balance the allocation as Agent 5 has only received one item so far.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5, 3],
    "6": [6]
}
```
