Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  69  24   7  61  95  47  54
1  22  56  98  26  78  52  31  71
2  57   4  67  23  69  10  88  30
3   9   2  55  46  13  90  44  22
4  66  73  30   7  35  40  36  57
5  41  46  72  94  44  92  86  58
6  59  58  27  91  76  77  29  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the values each agent places on the items and try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total value, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (since there are more items than agents, some agents will receive more than one item).

Let's first consider the highest valued items for each agent and try to allocate those accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valued item is item 5 (95).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valued item is item 2 (98).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valued item is item 6 (88).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valued item is item 5 (90), but already given to Agent 0. Second highest is item 2 (55), but already given to Agent 1. Third highest is item 3 (46).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valued item is item 1 (73).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valued item is item 3 (94), but already given to Agent 3. Second highest is item 5 (92), but already given to Agent 0. Third highest is item 6 (86), but already given to Agent 2. Fourth highest is item 7 (58).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valued item is item 3 (91), but already given to Agent 3. Second highest is item 5 (77), but already given to Agent 0. Third highest is item 4 (76).

Given these observations, let's allocate items to each agent ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and no item is assigned to more than one agent:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [7]
- Agent 6: [4]

There are 8 items and 7 agents, so one agent will need to receive an additional item. Let's choose based on the next highest value each agent has for any unallocated item:

- Agent 0 also values item 0 at 90, which is the highest unallocated value remaining.

Thus, the fair allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [4]
}
```
