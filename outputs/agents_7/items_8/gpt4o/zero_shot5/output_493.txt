Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  35  42  66  18  83  72  47
1   7  55  48  87  30  99  85  66
2  17  46  29  95  53   3  27   7
3  64  25  15   9  71  19  81   2
4  15  25  37  34  46  58  50   7
5  69  43  22   3  21  23  69   5
6  25   5  93  42  25  78  31  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use a method such as maximizing total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences.

Let's allocate items step-by-step:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuations for each item.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the highest value for that item, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
3. Make adjustments as needed to ensure all items are allocated and no agent receives more than necessary.

Now, let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value for item 5.
- Agent 1: Highest value for item 3.
- Agent 2: Highest value for item 0.
- Agent 3: Highest value for item 6.
- Agent 4: Highest value for item 4.
- Agent 5: Highest value for item 1.
- Agent 6: Highest value for item 2.

This covers all agents and items, but we still need to allocate item 7. Let's assign it to the agent with the next highest preference that doesn't already have a high number of items.

Agent 1 has the highest preference for item 7 among unallocated items, so we assign it there.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are fairly distributed based on the agents' valuations.
