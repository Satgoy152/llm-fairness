Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  73  89  60  83   5  86  46
1  64   9  61  83  21   0  25  17
2  91  91  46  20  81  82   2  30
3  16  75  67  16  78  69  39  97
4   5  35  13  97  97  78  97  37
5  41  14  45  54  27  39  48  51
6  25  75   6  13  75  47  19  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize each agent's valuation for the items they receive. One way to do this is by using a method similar to the "max-min fair share" or "envy-free" allocation. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 6.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for item 3.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for item 7.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 6.
6. Agent 5 can be allocated item 5.
7. Agent 6 can be allocated item 4.

Considering the above points, a possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 6
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: 
- Agent 5: Item 5
- Agent 6: Item 4

Let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4]
}
```
