Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  94   4  58  53  41  35  15
1  21  62  29  91   8  12  18  35
2  62  83  14  61  46  61  90  85
3  93  37  63  23  71  53   1  21
4  10  27  93  38   9  65  90  75
5  72  91  69  10  82  11  30  21
6  74   6  34  74  68   1  99  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation is as fair as possible based on the agents' valuations. Given the constraint of only having 8 items and needing to consider the valuations, we'll attempt to allocate items to maximize the total valuation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Matches**: Look for high valuations per agent and assign items that maximize individual satisfaction.
2. **Distribute Items Equitably**: Ensure that no agent receives an unfair share of items unless unavoidable due to constraints.

Following this approach, let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 1 (94).
- Agent 1 highly values item 3 (91).
- Agent 2 highly values item 6 (90).
- Agent 3 highly values item 0 (93).
- Agent 4 highly values item 2 (93).
- Agent 5 highly values item 5 (91).
- Agent 6 highly values item 6 (99). Since item 6 is already allocated to Agent 2, Agent 6 will get the next highest available, which is item 3 (74).

Based on this reasoning, below is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item with the highest possible valuation given the constraints. Agent 6 receives two items due to maximization of their total valuation with the remaining items.
