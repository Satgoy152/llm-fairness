Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  30  92  45  64  34  89  82
1  52  29  48  48  28  84  18   6
2  10   1  87  30  26  45  50   8
3  35  61  87  18  94  25  58   8
4  44  65  97  58  16  62  50   2
5  34  88  35   0  19  56  82  86
6  68  75  99  90  27  97   6  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52 29 48 48 28 84 18  6]
 [10  1 87 30 26 45 50  8]

 [44 65 97 58 16 62 50  2]
 [34 88 35  0 19 56 82 86]
 [68 75 99 90 27 97  6 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will focus on maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If some agents end up with no items, redistribute from agents with more than one item, aiming to maximize the overall happiness (valuation).

Following these steps, we can derive a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 0 (highest valuation for 0)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 5 (highest valuation for 1)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 6 (highest valuation for 2)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 4 (highest valuation for 3)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 2 (highest valuation for 4)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 7 (highest valuation for 5)
7. **Agent 6**: Item 3 (highest valuation for 6)

This leaves us with Item 1, which hasn't been allocated. We need to assign it to an agent to ensure all items are distributed.

Item 1 is allocated to Agent 5, who has the second-highest valuation for it.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [7, 1],
    "6": [3]
}
```
