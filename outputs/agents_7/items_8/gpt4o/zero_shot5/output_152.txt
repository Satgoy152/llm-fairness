Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  18  88  90   3  51  86  12
1  74  54  35  56  77  47  77  35
2   9  81  88  69  96  43   2   1
3  91  32  78  76  20  43  19  40
4   7  58   1  78  58  78  86  67
5  72  14   3  38  37  21  38  91
6  11  43  75   5  35  67   6  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item. One of the common approaches is to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if the number of agents is equal to or greater than the number of items. However, since we have more agents than items, some agents won't receive any items.

To start, let's consider allocating items based on the highest valuation for each item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 3 has the highest valuation of 91.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 81.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 88.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 90.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 96.
6. Item 5: Agent 6 has the highest valuation of 67.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 86.
8. Item 7: Agent 5 has the highest valuation of 91.

Now, let's ensure each agent is accounted for in the final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, and 6
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: Item 7
- Agent 6: Item 5

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [5]
}
```
