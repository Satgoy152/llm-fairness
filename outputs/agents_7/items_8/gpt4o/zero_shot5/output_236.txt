Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  83   9  97  22   3  34  59
1  67  98  65  39  96   6  35  43
2  31   0  32  75  92  96   0  14
3  79  82  54  71   8  22  40   1
4   4  21  70  28  40  43  85   7
5  60  70  14  44   0  95  21   5
6  15  27  66  15  39  35  14  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic: allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach aims to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents based on their provided valuations.

Let's process each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 3 (79). Assign to agent 3.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 1 (98). Assign to agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 4 (70). Assign to agent 4.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 0 (97). Assign to agent 0.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 1 (96). Assign to agent 1.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 2 (96). Assign to agent 2.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 4 (85). Assign to agent 4.

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 0 (59). Assign to agent 0.

Now let's prepare the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 6],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most while ensuring each agent is accounted for in the final allocation.
