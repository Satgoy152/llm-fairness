Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87   7  64  88  93  72   9  63
1  44  23  71   5  14   1  99  20
2  44  68   8  40  10  53  15  41
3  89   7  72  72  49  29  75  49
4  90  45  17  73  49  31  79  83
5   7  77  28  28  10  50  81  55
6  80  78  23  46   2  66  63   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[87  7 64 88 93 72  9 63]
 [44 23 71  5 14  1 99 20]
 [44 68  8 40 10 53 15 41]
 [89  7 72 72 49 29 75 49]
 [90 45 17 73 49 31 79 83]
 [ 7 77 28 28 10 50 81 55]
 [80 78 23 46  2 66 63  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure each agent gets at least one item as evenly as possible. Here's one way to do this:

1. Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.
2. If there are items left unassigned, assign them to the agents in a way that balances the total number of items each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

Agent 0 values item 4 the most with a value of 93.
Agent 1 values item 6 the most with a value of 99.
Agent 2 values item 1 the most with a value of 68.
Agent 3 values item 0 the most with a value of 89.
Agent 4 values item 7 the most with a value of 83.
Agent 5 values item 1 the most, but it's already taken, so we look for the next highest, which is item 5.
Agent 6 values item 1 the most, but it's already taken, so we look for the next highest, which is item 6, but it's also taken. The next is item 5, but it's taken, so we choose item 0, but it's taken, so we choose item 3.

Thus, we have the following allocations:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 6.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 0.
- Agent 4 gets item 7.
- Agent 5 gets item 5.
- Agent 6 gets item 3.

Now, we have assigned all 8 items.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [3]
}
```
