Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  41  15  36  94  32  20  25
1  99  76  25   7  41  77  35  34
2  95  57  12  16  41  79  29  35
3  51  26  24  57  90   4  11  83
4  24  57  63  44  59  31  13  53
5  49  53  70  63  32  23  76  23
6  47  41   8  36  75  45  31  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method where each agent gets at least one item, and no item is allocated to more than one agent. The goal is to ensure the allocation is as fair as possible based on the valuations provided. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. If conflicts arise (two agents value the same item the most), resolve them by comparing the next highest valued item for those agents and allocate accordingly.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (99).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (76).
- Item 2: Agent 5 values it the most (70).
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most (57).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (94).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (79).
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most (76). Since Agent 5 already has item 2, give item 6 to Agent 2 who values it the next highest (29).
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most (83).

Now, let's ensure each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Items 5, 6
- Agent 3: Item 3, 7
- Agent 4: No items yet
- Agent 5: Item 2
- Agent 6: No items yet

Since agents 4 and 6 have no items, we need to adjust the allocation to give them items without exceeding the total item count. Let's reallocate as follows:

1. Move item 1 from Agent 1 to Agent 4.
2. Move item 6 from Agent 2 to Agent 6.

Checking the final allocation:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [3, 7]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [2]
- Agent 6: [6]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and in total 8 items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [6]
}
```
