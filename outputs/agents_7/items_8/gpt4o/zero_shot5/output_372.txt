Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  51  38  29  55  37  79  98
1  74  33  83  84  90  33  87  31
2  54   6  29  98  93  30  57  40
3  25  24  55  52  43  58  80  93
4  98  64  59  83  25  48  47  57
5  89  37  59  62  88  52  45  47
6  44  35  24  86  32  17  21  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim for a distribution where each agent receives items they value highly, if possible. However, since we only have 8 items and 7 agents, not every agent will receive an item, and some agents might receive more than one item.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 7 the highest, so allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest, so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest, so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 7 highly, but it's already taken, so allocate item 6, which is their next highest valued item, to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 the highest, so allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 0 the highest, but it's taken, so allocate item 4, which is their next highest valued item, to Agent 5. Since item 4 is already taken, consider item 3 and 1 equally valued, allocate item 1 to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6** values item 3 the highest, but it's taken, so allocate item 7, which is their next highest valued item, to Agent 6. Since item 7 is taken, consider item 0 and 1 equally valued, allocate item 2 to Agent 6.

Now, let's arrange the allocations ensuring all 8 items are allocated without repetition:

- Agent 0: item 7
- Agent 1: item 4
- Agent 2: item 3
- Agent 3: item 6
- Agent 4: item 0
- Agent 5: item 1
- Agent 6: item 2

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [2]
}
```
