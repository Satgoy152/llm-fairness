Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  45  28  48  28  67  25  59
1  27  76  99  13  66  79  75  57
2  69  62  21  86  86  64  73  95
3   9  65  27   0  32  36  77  62
4  67  74  46  49  78  16  13  33
5  22  58  85  11  73  58  93  69
6  42  98  63  12   3  54   0  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items so that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, some agents will get more items than others. The goal is to maximize fairness by considering the highest valuations where possible.

Let's go through the allocations step-by-step:

1. Identify key preferences for each agent by considering the highest valuations.
2. Distribute items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent.
- Ensure all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
- Balance the allocation so that no agent is significantly disadvantaged.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Choose items with significant valuations like item 7 (59) and item 5 (67).
2. **Agent 1**: Choose high-value items like item 2 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: Choose high-value items like item 7 (95) and item 3 (86).
4. **Agent 3**: Choose item 6 (77).
5. **Agent 4**: Choose item 4 (78).
6. **Agent 5**: Choose item 6 (93).
7. **Agent 6**: Choose item 1 (98).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [],
    "6": [1]
}
```

### Explanation:
- Agent 0 gets items 5 and 7 (valuations of 67 and 59).
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (valuation of 99).
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (valuation of 86).
- Agent 3 gets item 6 (valuation of 77).
- Agent 4 gets item 4 (valuation of 78).
- Agent 5 does not get any item due to constraints.
- Agent 6 gets item 1 (valuation of 98).

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring fairness across allocations.
