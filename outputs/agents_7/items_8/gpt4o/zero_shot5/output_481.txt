Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  70  65  65  73  57  94  78
1  15  92  90  45  47  21  30  27
2  49  42  81  72  29  70  67  34
3  27  52  32   2  30  47  71  69
4  66  81  20  78  52  72  46  77
5  78  73  88  55  70  98  16  70
6  69  12   7  60  41  81  49  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We'll allocate items one by one, each time assigning an item to the agent who values it most highly, provided that agent doesn't already have too many items compared to others.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Find the highest value for each item and assign it to the corresponding agent.
2. Adjust if necessary to ensure each agent has at least one item and no agent has more than two items (given the constraints).

Following these steps:

- Item 0 is most valued by agent 5.
- Item 1 is most valued by agent 1.
- Item 2 is most valued by agent 5.
- Item 3 is most valued by agent 4.
- Item 4 is most valued by agent 0.
- Item 5 is most valued by agent 5.
- Item 6 is most valued by agent 0.
- Item 7 is most valued by agent 0.

Initial allocation based on maximum valuation:
- Agent 0: [4, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 6: []

To ensure fairness, we can adjust the allocation:
- Remove item 7 from agent 0 and give it to agent 3.
- Remove item 5 from agent 5 and give it to agent 2.
- Remove item 6 from agent 0 and give it to agent 6.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [0, 2]
- Agent 6: [6]

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 2],
    "6": [6]
}
```
