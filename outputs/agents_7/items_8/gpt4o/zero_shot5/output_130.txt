Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  60  56  59  47   1  85  55
1  53  40  87  44  63   9  69  12
2  85  96  67  51  21  55  64  73
3  59  65  43  99  14  47  80  26
4  28  50  46  36  69  16  58  59
5  79  55  43  32  47  31   5  37
6  74  88  61  96  65  75  92  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 60 56 59 47  1 85 55]
 [53 40 87 44 63  9 69 12]
 [85 96 67 51 21 55 64 73]
 [59 65 43 99 14 47 80 26]
 [28 50 46 36 69 16 58 59]
 [79 55 43 32 47 31  5 37]
 [74 88 61 96 65 75 92 57]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 highly, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 highly, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has a relatively high valuation for item 4, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 doesn't have very high valuations in general, but we can give item 5 to Agent 5 since it doesn't affect the fairness much.
7. Agent 6 values item 6 highly, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 6.
8. For item 7, Agent 2 has a relatively higher valuation, so we allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

This ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and we have allocated all 8 items.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6]
}
```
