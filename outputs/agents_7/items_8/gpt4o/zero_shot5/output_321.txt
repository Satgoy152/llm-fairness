Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  15  81   7  13  86  46  98
1  48  47  28  52  99  76  64   7
2  60  75  70  65  83  15  12  50
3  44  97  39  69  31  90  21  64
4  79  14  83  91  10  36  33  18
5  96  34  52  59  40  98  63  86
6   2  91  66  74  81  57  99  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute them in such a way that each agent gets items they value highly, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive one extra item. 

Let's analyze the values and try to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 7 (98) and item 5 (86).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 4 (99).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 4 (83).
4. Agent 3 highly values item 1 (97) and item 5 (90).
5. Agent 4 highly values item 3 (91).
6. Agent 5 highly values item 5 (98) and item 0 (96).
7. Agent 6 highly values item 6 (99).

Considering the above observations, we can make the following allocations:

- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [5, 0] (receives one extra item, as it values both highly)
- Agent 6: [2]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, and all 8 items are distributed. 

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5, 0],
    "6": [2]
}
```
