Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  72  63  46  51  50   1  91
1  33  51  71  19  80  43  89  76
2  37  38  30   9  87  81  32  10
3   2  56  89  19  77   8  46  16
4  26  48   7  90  13  24  49  63
5  76   0  37  93  84   1  90  24
6  70  42  90  77  90  30  99   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [70 42 90 77 90 30 99  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets a roughly equal share of the items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

Calculate the highest value each agent places on each item.
Allocate items to agents to maximize individual satisfaction.
Using this approach, here is a possible allocation:

Agent 0 highly values item 7.
Agent 1 highly values item 6.
Agent 2 highly values item 5.
Agent 3 highly values item 2.
Agent 4 highly values item 3.
Agent 5 highly values item 4.
Agent 6 highly values item 0 and item 1.
This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item with a high value to them, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [0, 1]
}
```
