Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  93  82  17  62   0  35  98
1  22  18  60  29  10  15  36  93
2  76  88  37  32  58  63  94  11
3  80  48  14  52  68  81  31  17
4  98  79  17   5  61  62  10  97
5  76  52   1  75  10  22  23   3
6  11  76  58  53  94  34  20  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. We'll aim to distribute the items based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness by distributing the items evenly.

One possible approach is to allocate the items to the agents who value them the most, but also try to ensure that the distribution is balanced. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values items [1, 7] highly.
2. Agent 1 values item [2] highly.
3. Agent 2 values item [6] highly.
4. Agent 3 values item [5] highly.
5. Agent 4 values item [0] highly.
6. Agent 5 values item [3] highly.
7. Agent 6 values item [4] highly.

This allocation considers each agent's highest-value items while ensuring that each agent is given at least one item where possible, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items they value highly, and all 8 items are distributed among the 7 agents.
