Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  40  70  72  47  10  48  92
1   9  99  86  20  19   4  50  92
2  62  70  44  96  80  46  75  93
3  26  11  51  19  99  36  30  20
4   5  74  79  46  64  39  33  15
5   1  38  67  83  51  20   8  36
6  74   7   8  88  86  16  79  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We can start by considering the highest valued items for each agent and ensuring that each item is allocated to only one agent.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 the highest at 92.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 99.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 96.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest at 99.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the highest at 79.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the highest at 83 (however, item 3 is already taken, so we find the next best available).
7. Agent 6 values item 0 the highest at 74.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item that they highly value. The key is to ensure that no item is assigned more than once, and all items are allocated. Here's how this allocation looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent getting at least one item. Note that agent 5 is allocated the next best available item since their highest valued item was already taken.
