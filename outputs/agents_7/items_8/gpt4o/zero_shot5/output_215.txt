Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  96  52  76   8  51  56  55
1  98  57  23  25  76  94  14  87
2  21  41  64  87   1  40  21  41
3  10  61  29  16  46  27  65  46
4  99  58  33  64  58   7  29  29
5  44  87  39  11   2  46  26   7
6  67  12  20  92  62  38  54  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the total value of the items as evenly as possible among the agents. Each agent should get a combination of items that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

1. Agent 0: 37 + 96 + 52 + 76 + 8 + 51 + 56 + 55 = 431
2. Agent 1: 98 + 57 + 23 + 25 + 76 + 94 + 14 + 87 = 474
3. Agent 2: 21 + 41 + 64 + 87 + 1 + 40 + 21 + 41 = 316
4. Agent 3: 10 + 61 + 29 + 16 + 46 + 27 + 65 + 46 = 300
5. Agent 4: 99 + 58 + 33 + 64 + 58 + 7 + 29 + 29 = 377
6. Agent 5: 44 + 87 + 39 + 11 + 2 + 46 + 26 + 7 = 262
7. Agent 6: 67 + 12 + 20 + 92 + 62 + 38 + 54 + 13 = 358

Now, letâ€™s allocate the items to maximize the fairness. This can be done by considering the highest valuations for each item and ensuring each agent gets at least one item wherever possible.

Here's an allocation that aims to balance the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 2: Item [3]
- Agent 3: Item [6]
- Agent 4: Item [2]
- Agent 5: No items
- Agent 6: Items [7]

This allocation ensures all items are fairly distributed. Now, let's present it in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [],
    "6": [7]
}
```
