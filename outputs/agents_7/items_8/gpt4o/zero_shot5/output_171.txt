Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  80  69  37  15  35  20  35
1  43  37  26  32   4  31  82  63
2  59  71  79  55  97  43   3  25
3  14  28  12  27  88  95  33  77
4  37  82  77  91  98  13  27  59
5  78  36  26  66   7  53  67  66
6  87  17  91  65   4  65  19  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach is straightforward and ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who places the highest value on it. Hereâ€™s how the allocation works:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 6 values it the most at 87.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the most at 82.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 6 values it the most at 91.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 4 values it the most at 91.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 4 values it the most at 98.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most at 95.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most at 82.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the most at 77.

Using this allocation method, each item is assigned based on the highest valuation. Now, let's format these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [1, 3, 4],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are allocated, with some agents receiving more than one item, while others might not receive any, based on their valuations.
