Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71   8  57  98  10   7  34  83
1  45  86  45  77  63  26  42  57
2  12  25  14   2  34  32  89  55
3  85  40  14  16  59  74  68  74
4  43  50   6  23   9  23  92  63
5  76  55  10  41  79  12  58   8
6  22  22  64   5  96  42  80  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. Here's one approach to achieve this:

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Identify the Highest Valuations**: Start by identifying which items have particularly high valuations from any agent and try to allocate those items to the respective agents to maximize satisfaction.

2. **Distribute Remaining Items**: Once the high-value items are allocated, distribute the remaining items to ensure each agent has a fair share and that all 8 items are allocated.

### Allocation:

Based on the table provided, here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 at 98, which is the highest value for that item.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 86, which is the highest value for that item.
- Agent 2 values item 6 at 89, which is the highest value for that item.
- Agent 3 values items 0 and 5 at 85 and 74, respectively.
- Agent 4 can be given item 7, which they value at 63.
- Agent 5 values item 4 at 79, which is the highest value for that item.
- Agent 6 can be given item 2, which they value at 64.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items according to their highest preferences when possible, and all 8 items are fairly distributed among the 7 agents.
