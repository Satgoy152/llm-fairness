Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  74  20  37  36  17  58  93
1  77  44  49  49   4  37  99  92
2  76  67  92  58  75  58   6  41
3  36  20  82   1  56  34  46  49
4   5  80  51  91  89  47  48  32
5  43  94   2  28  47  20  96  27
6  35  36  68  92  59  79  42  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while distributing all items. To achieve this, we will evaluate the highest valuations for each item and allocate it to the agent with the highest value for that particular item. Here's the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 79, which is the highest. Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 5 values it at 94, which is the highest. Assign to Agent 5.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it at 92, which is the highest. Assign to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 6 values it at 92, which is the highest. Assign to Agent 6.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 4 values it at 89, which is the highest. Assign to Agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 6 values it at 79, which is the highest. Assign to Agent 6.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 99, which is the highest. Assign to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 93, which is the highest. Assign to Agent 0.

Now, based on the highest valuations, the allocation of items is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while all items are distributed among the agents.
