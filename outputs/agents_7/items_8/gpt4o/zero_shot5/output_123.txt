Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  71  78  64  74  27   4  63
1  42  86  35  72   2   1  46  64
2  75  91  68  63  36  86  99  16
3  76  67  46  13  34  54   3  31
4  99   6  56  68  85  11  53  95
5   7  46  67  95  24  58  44  43
6  48  41   9  73  25  55  91   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given the data and constraints, here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Allocate items that have relatively higher values for this agent.
2. Agent 1: Allocate items where agent 1's valuation is relatively high compared to other agents.
3. Agent 2: Allocate items that maximize agent 2's satisfaction.
4. Agent 3: Allocate items where agent 3 has higher valuations.
5. Agent 4: Allocate items where agent 4's valuations are relatively high.
6. Agent 5: Allocate items where agent 5 values them highly.
7. Agent 6: Allocate items that agent 6 values more than others.

After analyzing the table and considering each agent's preference, here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [2, 7]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 6.
- Agent 3 gets item 5.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.
- Agent 5 gets item 3.
- Agent 6 gets items 2 and 7.

This ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, all 8 items are allocated, and the allocation reflects the agents' preferences based on their valuations.
