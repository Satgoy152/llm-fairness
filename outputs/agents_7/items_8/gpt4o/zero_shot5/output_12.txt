Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  44  59  83  22  48  94  49
1  97   7   8  38  89  58  28  43
2  81  64   8  90  34  34  73  64
3  44  41  51   3  25   1  19  13
4   4  86  10  37  48  26   0  42
5  24  70  40  97  52  14  55  12
6  19  76  16  27   9  10  48   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation received by each agent. A common approach to this problem is to use a method that ensures no agent envies another's allocation, known as an envy-free allocation.

Given there are 8 items and 7 agents, each agent can receive at least 1 item, and one agent can receive 2 items. Below is one possible allocation that attempts to respect these constraints:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Distribute the remaining item to the agent with the highest second preference who hasn't received their highest preference yet.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6], 
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2], 
    "4": [1], 
    "5": [4],
    "6": [5, 7]  
}
```

This allocation ensures:

- Each agent receives at least one item.
- The allocation is based on maximizing individual agent valuations.
- All 8 items are allocated.
