Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  52  58  66  65  16  65  95
1  89  73  43  22  77  63  16   6
2  84  29  70   7  18  19  49  78
3  13  10  53  96  53  56  51   6
4  63  46   0  62  18   9  42  93
5  74  36  97  90  22   9  83  70
6  50  92  23  93  82  22  65  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the 8 items among the 7 agents, we should try to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Each agent should ideally receive at least one item, but since we have more agents than items, some agents will not receive an item.
2. We will allocate items to agents based on who values them the most.

Let's determine a fair allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 89.
2. Item 1: Agent 6 values it the most at 92.
3. Item 2: Agent 5 values it the most at 97.
4. Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 96.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 77 (next highest after agent 3 who already has an item).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 63 (agent 1 gets another item since they have high valuations).
7. Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most at 83.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most at 95.

Now, let's present the allocations in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2, 6],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and higher-valued items are given to agents who appreciate them the most.
