Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  79  90  77  78  11  68   3
1  95  75  35  96  40  20  34  42
2  18  57  36  17  21  14  99  58
3   6  55   1   2  63  52  96   8
4  94  70  26   2   8  73  87  30
5  47  99  17  75  52  71  21  32
6  14  48  80  23  13  19  22  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [95 75 35 96 40 20 34 42]
 [18 57 36 17 21 14 99 58]

 [14 48 80 23 13 19 22 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility. This involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. In this case, with 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items.

Let's determine the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value is for item 2 (90).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value is for item 3 (96).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value is for item 6 (99).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value is for item 6 (96) but already taken, so item 4 (63).
5. **Agent 4:** Highest value is for item 0 (94).
6. **Agent 5:** Highest value is for item 1 (99).
7. **Agent 6:** Highest value is for item 2 (80) but already taken, so item 7 (70).

Agent 0 and Agent 4 have already received their highest value items, so for the remaining item (5), assign it to an agent with the next highest preference that has only one item, which is Agent 3.

Here is the item allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [7]
}
```
