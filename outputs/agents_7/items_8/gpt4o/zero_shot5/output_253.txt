Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64   8  70   8  47  90  86  45
1   8  78  21  92  68  68   9  51
2  52  46   3  78   7  12  57   2
3  88  41  56  36  30  42  80  96
4  55  53  34  81  50  32  79  99
5  17  21  95  47  95  98  87  23
6  11   4  27  53  35   7  42  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [11  4 27 53 35  7 42 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated. Since there are 7 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others.

One approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations for each item while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (value: 88).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (value: 78).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 5 (value: 95).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (value: 92).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 5 (value: 95).
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 5 (value: 98).
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (value: 86).
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by Agent 4 (value: 99).

Now we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0: Item 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: No item
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 7
- Agent 5: Items 2, 4, 5
- Agent 6: No item

Since Agent 2 and Agent 6 do not receive any items, we might need to reallocate to make it fairer:

Let's adjust by reallocating one item from Agent 1 to Agent 2 and one from Agent 5 to Agent 6, focusing on the second-highest valuations for those items:

- Item 3 (originally with Agent 1, second-highest valuation is Agent 2 with 78)
- Item 4 (originally with Agent 5, second-highest valuation is Agent 6 with 35)

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 6
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 7
- Agent 5: Items 2, 5
- Agent 6: Item 4

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2, 5],
    "6": [4]
}
```
