Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  23  90  86   8  72  77  52
1  28  59  53  97  39   0  35  67
2  58  95  82  88  40  37  41  61
3  77  76   0  25  19  36  49  56
4  47  23  89  66  83  22  83  89
5  94  43  43  20  85  80  68  86
6  73  41  59  30  12  83  37  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[50 23 90 86  8 72 77 52]
 [28 59 53 97 39  0 35 67]
 [58 95 82 88 40 37 41 61]

 [94 43 43 20 85 80 68 86]
 [73 41 59 30 12 83 37 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 7 agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent that values it the most. We'll go through each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item. Below is the allocation process:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 94 by Agent 5.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 95 by Agent 2.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 90 by Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 97 by Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 85 by Agent 5.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 83 by Agent 6.
7. Item 6: Highest value is 83 by Agent 4.
8. Item 7: Highest value is 89 by Agent 4.

Now, let's organize the allocations according to the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [6, 7],
    "5": [0, 4],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each item going to the agent who values it the most.
