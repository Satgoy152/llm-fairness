Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  16  81  96  70  61  60  72
1  94   2  32  20  29  41  48  97
2  23  62  68  18   5  94  54  93
3  44  52  28  90  77  75  32   7
4  19  55  62  26  26  12  24   7
5   9  29  76  18  10   9  77  42
6  11  68  45  91  19  29  89  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [11 68 45 91 19 29 89 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that considers the highest valuations agents have for the items. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive an additional item. Here's how the allocation can be structured:

1. First, identify each agent's highest-valued item and allocate it to them if it hasn't been taken by another agent with a higher preference.
2. Once each agent has at least one item, allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations, ensuring no item is left unallocated.
3. In cases of ties or conflicts, try to balance the allocations so that each agent's total valuation is reasonably fair.

Here's a possible allocation that considers the above points:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [1]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 7 because they have high valuations for both.
- Agent 0 receives item 3, which is their highest valuation.
- Agents 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 receive items based on their highest remaining valuations that are unallocated. 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, balancing the overall valuations.
