Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  29  41  29  93  65   1  56
1  76  39  28  17  22   0  34  55
2  25  61  64  59  61  52  80   0
3  55  96  33  46  12  66  73  70
4  85  55   7  61  12  16  58  70
5  91  66  63  51  17  75  60  15
6  95  62  77  54  43  36  66  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated, we can aim to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to the agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Based on the given valuations, here's a feasible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 4 (highest value for item 4).
- Agent 1 gets item 0 (highest value for item 0).
- Agent 2 gets item 6 (highest value for item 6).
- Agent 3 gets item 1 (highest value for item 1).
- Agent 4 gets item 3 (highest value for item 3).
- Agent 5 gets item 5 (highest value for item 5).
- Agent 6 gets items 2 and 7 (highest value for item 2 and second-highest for item 7).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each item goes to an agent who values it highly. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2, 7]
}
```
