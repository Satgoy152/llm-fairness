Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72   2  92  87  98  14  49  98
1  94  77  86  24  85  16   4   1
2  35  94  26  17  15   0   5  11
3  44   6  16  59  47  84  43  38
4   3  53  18  97  67  24  12  32
5  16  37  42  21  87  67  90  34
6  45  42  54  20  51  43  39   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations. Given that there are 8 items and 7 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. Let's allocate the items based on a simple strategy of maximizing total valuation for all agents, ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 and item 7 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 5 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 6 can take item 2.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their respective preferences where possible.
