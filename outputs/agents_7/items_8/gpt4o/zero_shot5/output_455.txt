Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  51   1  72  68  47  78  30
1  13  41  69  27   9  62  82  67
2  59  99  32  41  34   1  29  11
3  26  48  16  47  71  25  91  61
4  10  64  51  98  38  53  74  35
5  56  76  42  36  12  63  32  31
6  15  68  88  92  39  63  98  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a number of items that corresponds to the relative valuations they have for those items. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the total number of allocated items equals 8.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest.
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 the highest.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 the highest, but since Agent 1 takes item 6, Agent 3 gets item 4.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest.
6. **Agent 5** values item 5 the highest.
7. **Agent 6** values item 6 the highest, but since it's already taken, they get item 3 which is their next highest valued item.

With these high-value items assigned to the agents, we can distribute the remaining items by valuing the next highest available items:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 3
- Agent 5: Item 5
- Agent 6: Items 2 and 7

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 3
- Agent 5: Item 5
- Agent 6: Items 2 and 7

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated.
