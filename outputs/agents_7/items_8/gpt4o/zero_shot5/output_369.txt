Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  35  23  79  37   4  88  57
1  14  89  37  61  69  13  48  23
2  10  16  63  50  96  29  93  88
3  36  94  79  26  85  94  45  66
4  37  15  91  43  54   7  67  14
5  72  30  55  69  78  94  76  83
6  84  64  33  37  54  53  65  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the individual valuation of each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. One approach is to allocate the items based on the highest valuation for each item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 6 (84).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (94).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 4 (91).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (79).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (96).
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (94), but since Agent 3 already has an item, allocate it to the next highest, Agent 5 (94).
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (88), but since Agent 0 already has an item, allocate it to Agent 2 (93).
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (88), but Agent 2 already has two items, so allocate it to Agent 5 (83).

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the total number of items allocated is 8:

- Assign one item to each agent with the highest valuation, and adjust the allocations as needed to ensure fairness across all agents.

Here's a fair allocation of items:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5, 7],
    "6": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one opportunity for a fair share based on their highest valuations, and all 8 items are allocated.
