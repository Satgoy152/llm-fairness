Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  43  76  99  71  47  48  90
1  57  26   0  81  99  11  49  84
2  43  31  35  32  90  94  59  58
3  52  74  85  17  45  72  17  85
4  50  65  35  56   8  89  43  55
5   1  35  85  51   4  56  79  18
6  85  81  85  90  29  11  52  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring an equitable distribution of items. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate each agent's highest-valued item and try to allocate items based on maximizing individual agent's satisfaction.
2. Ensure all items are distributed, and no agent receives more than one item unless necessary.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (99), so assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 4 (99), so assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 5 (94), so assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 2 (85), so assign item 2 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 highly values item 5 (89), but since it's taken, assign item 1 (65) to agent 4.
- Agent 5 highly values item 2 (85), but since it's taken, assign item 6 (79) to agent 5.
- Agent 6 highly values item 7 (94), so assign item 7 to agent 6.

After this initial allocation, we have allocated 7 items. We need to assign one more item:

- Agent 0 also values item 0 (65) highly, so assign item 0 to agent 0.

Thus, each agent receives at least one item, and we distribute all items fairly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [7]
}
```
