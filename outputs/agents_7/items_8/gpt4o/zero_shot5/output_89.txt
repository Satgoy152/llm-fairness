Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  81  98  75  25  48   5  90
1  92  48  50  18  27  77  37  44
2  67   5  63  14  72  21   5  41
3  60  54  38  73  41  58  38  95
4  74  74  68  16  79   6  97  77
5   2   8  97  49  25   2  13  45
6  85  77  79  68  63  99  93  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to assign items to agents such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. Given there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items while the others get one each.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 2 (98).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 0 (92).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 4 (72).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 7 (95).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 6 (97).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 2, but that's already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is item 3 (49).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value is for item 5 (99).

Now, we need to assign the remaining items, which are items 1 and potentially one more to one agent since we have 8 items and only 7 agents.

Given the valuations and to maintain fairness, let's assign:

- **Agent 2**: Add item 1 (5) since Agent 2 has a low overall valuation compared to others.

Here's how the allocation looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent gets at least one item, with one agent receiving two items, and attempts to balance the total valuations as fairly as possible given the input data.
