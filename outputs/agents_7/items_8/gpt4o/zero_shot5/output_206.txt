Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  74  56  41  97  21   0  37
1  57  35  12  62  66  50   5  28
2  90  13  56   6  10  42  30  60
3  49  64  72  25  26  76  65  11
4  79  36  22  80  45  18  12  48
5   1  49  20  40  31  91  23  46
6  78  63   5  50  61  73  53  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent by considering their valuations. A common approach is to allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most and hasn't yet received an item. Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. Start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets a chance to receive at least one item if possible.

2. Once each agent has at least one item, continue allocating the remaining items to maximize individual agent satisfaction.

Here's the allocation process:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 90.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 74.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 72.
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most at 80.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 97.
- Item 5: Agent 5 values it the most at 91.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most at 65, but Agent 3 already has an item. Next highest is Agent 6 at 53.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 60, but Agent 2 already has an item. Next highest is Agent 6 at 60, then Agent 0 already has an item. Next highest is Agent 1 at 28.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 4]
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [5]
- Agent 6: [6]

Representing this in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6]
}
```
