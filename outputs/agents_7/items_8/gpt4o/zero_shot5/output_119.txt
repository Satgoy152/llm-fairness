Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73   1  97  70   2  99  49  95
1  95  71  74  90  96  41  72  11
2  80  22  57  75  98  69  51   5
3  82  29  32  27  25  99  54  47
4   4  37  43  47  95  55  97  71
5  20  54   3   3  76  66  65   2
6  90  48  48  17  23  74  85  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation and distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share of value, if possible. Given there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive 2 items, while the others receive 1 item each. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than one item until all others have at least one.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 1 (95)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 1 (71)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 0 (97)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 1 (90)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 2 (98)
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 0 (99)
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 4 (97)
- Item 7: Highest value by Agent 0 (95)

Since Agent 1 has the highest value for three items, we need to adjust to ensure fairness:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 6 (next highest at 48)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3 (next highest at 27)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 3
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 4
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 0

This results in:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 7
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Items 3, 5
- Agent 4: Item 6
- Agent 5: No item
- Agent 6: Item 1

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [],
    "6": [1]
}
```
