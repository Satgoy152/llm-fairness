Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  41  60  67  62  57  79  35
1  84   0  74  32  83  98  86  72
2  47  92  28  78  57  99  38  17
3  22  73  86  53  33  97  61  71
4   1  72  43  53  96  92  53  13
5  51   7  75  11  97  71  14  96
6  88  99  62  24  37  63  18  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to maximize the overall satisfaction by allocating items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and exactly 8 items are allocated in total.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Gets item 6 (value 79).
2. **Agent 1**: Gets item 5 (value 98).
3. **Agent 2**: Gets item 1 (value 92).
4. **Agent 3**: Gets item 2 (value 86).
5. **Agent 4**: Gets item 4 (value 96).
6. **Agent 5**: Gets item 7 (value 96).
7. **Agent 6**: Gets item 0 (value 88).
8. **Agent 6**: Gets item 3 (value 24).

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents. Note that agent 6 receives two items to ensure that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [0, 3]
}
```
