Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  52  21  65  49  66  93  23
1  97  91   6  59  73  52  53  36
2  76   9  90  70  19  45  70  61
3  26   8  81  89  48  72  34  49
4  51  69  23  55  98  65  70  76
5  74  97  50   3  13  39  59   9
6  56  34  56  46  87  70   5  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 7 agents, we can use a method that tries to balance the total value each agent receives. Below is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that attempts to equalize the total value received by each agent as much as possible, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's calculate the total values:

- Agent 0: \(61 + 52 + 21 + 65 + 49 + 66 + 93 + 23 = 430\)
- Agent 1: \(97 + 91 + 6 + 59 + 73 + 52 + 53 + 36 = 467\)
- Agent 2: \(76 + 9 + 90 + 70 + 19 + 45 + 70 + 61 = 440\)
- Agent 3: \(26 + 8 + 81 + 89 + 48 + 72 + 34 + 49 = 407\)
- Agent 4: \(51 + 69 + 23 + 55 + 98 + 65 + 70 + 76 = 507\)
- Agent 5: \(74 + 97 + 50 + 3 + 13 + 39 + 59 + 9 = 344\)
- Agent 6: \(56 + 34 + 56 + 46 + 87 + 70 + 5 + 13 = 367\)

We will allocate items to try to balance these totals. Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [0, 4]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2, 6]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [5, 7]
- Agent 5: []
- Agent 6: []

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in a way that balances the total values as much as possible. The JSON format representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 7],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation has distributed all 8 items among the agents, and each agent is included in the list, even if they receive no items.
