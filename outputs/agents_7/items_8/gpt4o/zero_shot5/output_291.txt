Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  32   4  19  45  19  64  24
1   2  74  18  71   9   8  31  55
2  91  82   4  97  77  84  71  58
3  52  52  46  94  45  33  53  53
4  59  95  22  36  20  58  53  41
5  12  41  64  97  34  38  16  47
6  79   8  71  74  86  15  86  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [79  8 71 74 86 15 86 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy where each agent receives one item based on their highest valuation. Since there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive two items, and the rest will receive one item each. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is 78 for item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is 74 for item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is 97 for item 3.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is 94 for item 3, but it's already taken. Next highest is 53 for item 6 or 7.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is 95 for item 1, but it's already taken. Next highest is 58 for item 5.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is 97 for item 3, but it's already taken. Next highest is 64 for item 2.
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value is 86 for item 4 or 6.

Now let's allocate:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 6.
- Agent 4 gets item 5.
- Agent 5 gets item 2.
- Agent 6 gets item 4.

Since agent 6 was a tie between item 4 and item 6, and item 6 is already allocated to agent 3, agent 6 will get item 4. Now we have one item left, item 7, which we can allocate to the agent with the least total valuation value among their received items or any other fair criteria. Here, we can allocate item 7 to agent 0 (since they received an item with a relatively lower value compared to the others).

The final allocation can be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [4]
}
```
