Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  25  52  37  46   7  25  22
1  75  14  26  98  63  54  67  27
2  73  76  43  97  96  17  21  91
3  49  40  45  88  25  54  14  44
4  63  18  18  17  51   2  70  44
5  21  79  42  81  52  70  62   2
6  51  94  89  46  27  96  34  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the overall happiness of each agent based on their valuations of the items. One possible approach is to ensure that each item is given to the agent who values it the most. Here is a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing the value for each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 75.
2. Item 1: Agent 6 values it the most at 94.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 52.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 98.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 96.
6. Item 5: Agent 6 values it the most at 96.
7. Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most at 70.
8. Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 91.

Now, let's put these allocations into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [],
    "6": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly based on the agents' valuations, with each item going to the agent who values it the most.
