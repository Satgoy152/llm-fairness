Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  25   1  28   1  63  25  18
1  95  41  45  93  78  85   6  43
2  21  51  73  64  59  13  18  36
3  14  58  60  30  14   1  90  27
4   0   4  12  67  97  18   7  49
5  22  88   1  66  26  63  98  21
6  15  26  19  85  22  78  23  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated. Here is one way to do it:

1. Assign items to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the valuations and allocate items accordingly:

- Item 0 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (95).
- Item 1 has the highest valuation from Agent 5 (88).
- Item 2 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (73).
- Item 3 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (93).
- Item 4 has the highest valuation from Agent 4 (97).
- Item 5 has the highest valuation from Agent 0 (63).
- Item 6 has the highest valuation from Agent 5 (98).
- Item 7 has the highest valuation from Agent 4 (49).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item by adjusting the allocations slightly if needed:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 6 (previously assigned to Agent 5)
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 1
- Agent 6: Item 7 (previously assigned to Agent 4 to ensure Agent 6 gets an item)

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.
