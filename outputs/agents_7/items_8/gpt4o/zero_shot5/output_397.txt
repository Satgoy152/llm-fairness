Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59   6  18  44  71  95  48  30
1   3  98  22  27  56  95  38  53
2  66  53  65  31  51  38  85  66
3  89  43  34  76  98  67  44  83
4  74  35  91   1  47  62  78  99
5  95  40  92   3  31  37  77  32
6  28  46  97  78  27  82  40  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[59  6 18 44 71 95 48 30]
 [ 3 98 22 27 56 95 38 53]
 [66 53 65 31 51 38 85 66]
 [89 43 34 76 98 67 44 83]
 [74 35 91  1 47 62 78 99]
 [95 40 92  3 31 37 77 32]
 [28 46 97 78 27 82 40 81]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent’s highest-valued items. We have 8 items and 7 agents, so one agent will receive two items.

Here’s a potential allocation strategy:

Agent 0: Item 4 (71)
Agent 1: Item 1 (98)
Agent 2: Item 6 (85)
Agent 3: Item 0 (89)
Agent 4: Item 7 (99)
Agent 5: Item 2 (92)
Agent 6: Item 5 (82) and Item 3 (78)
This allocation considers the highest values and attempts to distribute the items to maximize individual satisfaction. Agent 6 receives two items as they have high values for both.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [5, 3]
}
```
