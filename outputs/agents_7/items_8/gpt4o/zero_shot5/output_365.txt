Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  34  20  24  18  32  30  36
1  19   2  55  12  97  59  33  93
2   7  19  25  95  79  55  24  81
3  54  44  47  69  10  41  54  45
4  26   2  29  73  22  32  39  93
5  96  12  93   0  93  90  14  45
6  13  31  29  47   8  18  79  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. First, we need to determine the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Then, allocate items to agents such that each agent gets the items they value the most while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's compute the total value each agent has for the items and allocate accordingly:

Agent 0: Total value = 288
Agent 1: Total value = 370
Agent 2: Total value = 385
Agent 3: Total value = 364
Agent 4: Total value = 316
Agent 5: Total value = 443
Agent 6: Total value = 236

Now, considering the valuations and aiming for a fair allocation, we can proceed as follows:

- Agent 0: Allocated items [0, 1] (valued at 94 and 34)
- Agent 1: Allocated items [4, 7] (valued at 97 and 93)
- Agent 2: Allocated items [3, 5] (valued at 95 and 55)
- Agent 3: Allocated item [6] (valued at 54)
- Agent 4: Allocated item [2] (valued at 29)
- Agent 5: No items allocated
- Agent 6: No items allocated

In this way, each agent gets their most valued items while ensuring that all items are allocated and the allocation is fair based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items have been distributed among the agents.
