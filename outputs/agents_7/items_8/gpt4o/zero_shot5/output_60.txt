Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  33  12  36  60  64  87   4
1  23  16  23  69  56  27  30  36
2  32  58  95  58  29  41  53  28
3  21  72   5  64  86  64  72  44
4  45  15  22  80  17  90  41  41
5  10  57   4   0  52  68   2  68
6  41  89  15  73  42  23  89  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value relatively high, while ensuring the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. Each agent should ideally receive at least one item based on their highest valuations.
2. Attempt to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most, so assign item 6 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most, so assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most, so assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most, so assign item 4 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most, so assign item 5 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 7 the most, so assign item 7 to agent 5.
- Agent 6 values item 1 the most, so assign item 1 to agent 6.

This allocation covers 7 items. We need to allocate one more item. Let's consider the remaining unallocated item 0:

- Assign item 0 to agent 4, as they have a decent valuation for it and currently only have one item.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 0],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [1]
}
```

This allocation should fairly distribute the items based on the agents' valuations, while ensuring an integer number of items is allocated to each agent, with a total of 8 items distributed.
