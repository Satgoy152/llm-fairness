Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  87  59  69  20  47  87  38
1  22  79  78   2  72  58  55  96
2  30  51  10  17  93  37  78   6
3  43  29  82  95   5  29  14  28
4  98  69  22  62  96  52  62  68
5  12  17  67  75  99  12   9  14
6  81  87  55  46  95   0  45  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent's interests or valuations are considered while assigning the items. We will aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation for each item assigned to an agent. Given that there are 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will receive an additional item. Here's how we can achieve this:

1. Calculate the highest valuation for each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item by redistributing if necessary.
3. Check that only and exactly 8 items are allocated.

Following these steps, we can arrive at a reasonable distribution:

- Item 0: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (98).
- Item 1: Agent 0 and Agent 6 both have high valuations (87), but let's assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (82).
- Item 3: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (95).
- Item 4: Agent 5 has the highest valuation (99).
- Item 5: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (58).
- Item 6: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (78).
- Item 7: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (96).

Now, let's check that each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [5, 7]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [2, 3]
- Agent 4: [0]
- Agent 5: [4]
- Agent 6: []

Agent 6 does not have any items yet, so we need to reallocate one item. We can give item 5 from Agent 1 to Agent 6, as Agent 1 still has item 7.

After this adjustment, the final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated.
