Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  21  53   9  50  36  88  41
1  79  26  95  39  16  82  28  96
2  51  25  96  66  72  92  96  92
3  88  87  25  60  39  93  30  31
4  87  42  88  66  12  31  42  98
5  15  80  58  85  53  68   3  36
6  69  76  85   5  10  44  67  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and distribute the items in such a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction. One strategy is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent and assign them accordingly.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated while maintaining balance among agents.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most (value 88).
- Agent 1 values item 7 the most (value 96).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (value 96).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (value 88).
- Agent 4 values item 7 the most (value 98), but since item 7 is already assigned, next highest is item 2 (value 88), already assigned, then item 0 (value 87).
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most (value 85).
- Agent 6 values item 2 the most (value 85), but since item 2 is already assigned, next highest is item 1 (value 76).

Now, let's allocate remaining items to balance:

- Agent 0 gets item 4 (value 50).
- Agent 1 gets item 5 (value 82).
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 66).
- Agent 3 gets item 1 (value 87).

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [7, 5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3],
    "6": []
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, with consideration to their valuations.
