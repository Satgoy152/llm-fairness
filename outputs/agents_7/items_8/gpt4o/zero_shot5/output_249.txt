Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  24  63  49  39  50  66  27
1  30  71  99  25  96  46  41  69
2  14  77   8  89  96  70   7  94
3  54   6  71   9  65  81  83  61
4  84  84  99  66  31  87  36  94
5  33  31  51  81  61  42  12  13
6  92  79  74  35  31   5  22  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on the given valuations, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through the process:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Max value: Agent 6 with 92
2. **Item 1**:
   - Max value: Agent 4 with 84
3. **Item 2**:
   - Max value: Agents 1 and 4 with 99
   - Tie-breaker: Assign to Agent 4
4. **Item 3**:
   - Max value: Agent 2 with 89
5. **Item 4**:
   - Max value: Agent 1 with 96
6. **Item 5**:
   - Max value: Agent 3 with 81
7. **Item 6**:
   - Max value: Agent 3 with 83
8. **Item 7**:
   - Max value: Agents 2 and 4 with 94
   - Tie-breaker: Assign to Agent 2

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and adjust as needed:

- Agent 0: Unassigned (no high values)
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 3, 7
- Agent 3: Items 5, 6
- Agent 4: Items 1, 2
- Agent 5: Unassigned (no high values)
- Agent 6: Item 0

Now, let's reallocate if necessary to ensure fairness and at least one item per agent where possible:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (reallocation from Agent 6, since Agent 6 has no other high values)
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 3, 7
- Agent 3: Items 5, 6
- Agent 4: Items 1, 2
- Agent 5: None (as no items have a high value for Agent 5)
- Agent 6: None

Since Agent 5 cannot be served with their highest value item, they are left without an item. Agent 0 gets one item based on reallocation due to fairness.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": [],
    "6": []
}
```
