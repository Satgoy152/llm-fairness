Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  23  32  35  13  64  27  81
1  47  56   1  61   1  91   5  15
2  77   2   6  57  62  43  45  62
3   6  40  16  62  28  95   6  23
4  59  35   8  96  44  80  15  54
5   1  45  51  62  72  43  93  99
6  20  43  52  20  51  35  80   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items that they value highly while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share. Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, some agents may receive more than one item.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most with a value of 95.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the most with a value of 91.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the most, but since it is already allocated, the next highest is item 4 with a value of 62.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most, but since it is already allocated, the next highest is item 3 with a value of 62.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the most, but since it is already allocated, the next highest is item 5 with a value of 80.
6. Agent 5 values item 7 the most with a value of 99.
7. Agent 6 values item 6 the most with a value of 80.

Allocate items based on the highest remaining value for each agent, and ensure each item is only allocated to one agent:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets item 1.
- Agent 5 gets item 7.
- Agent 6 gets item 6.

By this allocation, each agent receives at least one item that they value highly.
