Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  44  76  45  80  86  97  88
1  46  29  42  56  40  80  77  74
2  29  91  21  85  83  79  73  16
3  63  66  66  21  88  48  71  25
4  46  48  43  34  59  17  99  78
5  32  97  31  56  18  38  86  34
6  78  40   5  93  87  34  53  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and we try to respect the valuations as much as possible. Given there are 7 agents and 8 items, this means one agent will receive two items, while the others receive one or none.

Here's a possible allocation that ensures fair distribution while considering the valuations:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 96).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 5 (value 97).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 76).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 6 (value 93).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 3 (value 88).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 80).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 4 (value 99).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value 16).

This allocation aims to maximize the value for each agent based on their preferences.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [3]
}
```
