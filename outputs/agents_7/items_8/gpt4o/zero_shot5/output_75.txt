Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  16  58  97   0  90  34  59
1  65  78  54  46  22  38  87  34
2  15   5  48   1  34  69   8  99
3   8  53   4  71  21  87  51  17
4  32  53  42  93  67  68  97  18
5  40  61  97  81  92  91  22   0
6  78  75  37  14  71  13  67  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning them the items they value the most. Each agent should receive at least one item, given there are 7 agents and 8 items.

The allocation process can be as follows:
1. Assign each agent one item they value the most.
2. Allocate the remaining item to an agent who values it highly, but not necessarily the highest, balancing overall satisfaction.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 3 (97).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 0 (65).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 7 (99).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 5 (87).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 6 (97).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 2 (97).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value is for item 0 (78), but since item 0 is already taken, next highest value is for item 1 (75).

Now, we have one item left, which is item 4. This can be allocated to an agent who values it reasonably high compared to their other items and doesn't have the maximum number of items allocated yet. 

- **Agent 4** has a high value for item 4 (67). Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

With these allocations, each agent gets at least one item, and all items are fairly distributed.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6, 4],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [1]
}
```
