Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  22  83  24  85  91  86  35
1  52  19  73  23   0  60  26  92
2  67  33  68  54  57  49  15  61
3  69  98  17  73  36  58  53   7
4   7  78  93   5  27  39  14   1
5   5  31  96  13  21  89  14  46
6  10  30  10  29  75  90  72  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the idea of maximizing the total value received by each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. We need to make sure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the allocation is as fair as possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Get item 5 (value 91).
2. Agent 1: Get item 7 (value 92).
3. Agent 2: Get item 0 (value 67) and item 3 (value 54).
4. Agent 3: Get item 1 (value 98).
5. Agent 4: Get item 2 (value 93).
6. Agent 5: Get item 6 (value 14).
7. Agent 6: Get item 4 (value 75).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets a fair share based on the given valuations. Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [4]
}
```
