Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22   2  96  91  31  23  84  91
1  44  49  27  54  12  48  65  85
2  79  56  90  40  55  67  83  14
3  87  30  62  63  73   3  20  95
4  22  13  92  89  39  39  11  75
5  13  63   1  65  81  23  75  58
6  16   6   1  79  22  92  93  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents given their valuation matrix, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Since there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items while the rest will receive one.

Let's proceed with the allocation process step by step:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   - For each item, determine which agent values it the most.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Adjustments:**
   - Since we have 8 items and 7 agents, one agent will have to receive two items. We'll adjust the allocations such that the total value for each agent is balanced as much as possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Item 0:** Agent 3 values it the most with 87.
- **Item 1:** Agent 5 values it the most with 63.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it the most with 96.
- **Item 3:** Agent 6 values it the most with 79.
- **Item 4:** Agent 5 values it the most with 81.
- **Item 5:** Agent 6 values it the most with 92.
- **Item 6:** Agent 6 values it the most with 93.
- **Item 7:** Agent 3 values it the most with 95.

### Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [0, 7]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [1, 4]
- Agent 6: [3, 5, 6]

### Adjustment:
To ensure fairness, we need to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item. We notice that Agent 6 has three items, but Agent 6 values them highly. We'll proceed by redistributing items to ensure every agent gets at least one item.

- **Redistribute Item 6:** We will give item 6 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 has no items, and Agent 1 values it reasonably at 65.
- **Redistribute Item 3:** We give item 3 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 has no items, and Agent 2 values it at 40.
- **Redistribute Item 5:** Since Agent 6 has two items, we can give item 5 to Agent 4, who has no items, and values it at 39.

### Final Allocation:
Now, we have:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [0, 7]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [1, 4]
- Agent 6: []

Thus, the allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1, 4],
    "6": []
}
```
