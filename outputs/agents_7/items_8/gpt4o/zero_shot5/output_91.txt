Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58   9  52  57  49  73  41  24
1   1  69  80  63  54  84  58   6
2  44  60  84  62  74  35  95  86
3  63  37  56  78  45  72  26  10
4  24  72  83  46  65  71  58  91
5  64  75   8  35  11   6  81  91
6  72  19  98  84  48  26  42  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [72 19 98 84 48 26 42 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items. Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items, and the rest will receive one item each.

Let's go through a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Can take item 0 (value = 58)
2. **Agent 1**: Can take item 5 (value = 84)
3. **Agent 2**: Can take item 6 (value = 95)
4. **Agent 3**: Can take item 3 (value = 78)
5. **Agent 4**: Can take item 7 (value = 91)
6. **Agent 5**: Can take item 1 (value = 75)
7. **Agent 6**: Can take item 2 (value = 98)
8. The remaining item 4 can be assigned to any agent who has a lower total value to balance fairness. Let's assign it to Agent 0 (value = 49).

Therefore, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [2]
}
```
