Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  51   3   7  34  31  81  11
1  75  63  39  90  86  54  27  24
2  47  83  27  21  25   4  42  78
3  42  39  35  58  83   6  84  75
4  83  86   1  19  26  13  84  38
5   4  48  35  71  75  82  40  37
6  54  30  65  46  60   7  79  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A fair allocation attempts to maximize the satisfaction or value received by each agent while ensuring that every agent receives at least one item, if possible. However, since there are more agents than items, some agents may not receive any items.

One approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations, ensuring each item goes to the agent who values it the most. We'll go through each item and assign it to the agent with the highest value for that item, ensuring that no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 83 by agent 4.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 86 by agent 4.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 65 by agent 6.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 90 by agent 1.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 86 by agent 1.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 82 by agent 5.
7. Item 6: Highest value is 84 by agent 3.
8. Item 7: Highest value is 78 by agent 2.

After allocating based on the highest valuation for each item, we get:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it the most, maximizing overall satisfaction. Note that agent 0 does not receive any items in this allocation.
