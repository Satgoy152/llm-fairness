Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3   2  94  83  48  89  31   8
1  92   2  49  80  27  24  67  62
2  75   7   6  11  80  54  95  41
3  60  25  75  94  37  74  55  77
4  46  73  62  58  33  37  63  44
5  28  93  18  85  47  45  25  51
6  11  20  80  22  84  94  59  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuation for that item, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given there are 7 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive two items.

Let's determine the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest value for item 2 with a value of 94.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest value for item 0 with a value of 92.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest value for item 6 with a value of 95.
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest value for item 3 with a value of 94.
5. **Agent 4**: Has the highest value for item 1 with a value of 73.
6. **Agent 5**: Has the highest value for item 5 with a value of 45.
7. **Agent 6**: Has the highest value for item 4 with a value of 84.

The remaining item is item 7. Agent 3 has a high value for item 7 (77), so we can assign it to Agent 3 as well, since they already received one item.

Now, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valuation for the items, and all 8 items are allocated.
