Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  38  52  27  79  37  55  31
1  61  21  56   6   1  59  12  89
2  58  71  81  76  86  22  23  10
3  30  63  35  26  37   0  84  59
4  29  39  85  50  30  59  62  33
5  13  56   6  25  17  80  71  69
6  77  53  32  25  84   2   0   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's value for each item. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction or value while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value for item 4 (value 79).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value for item 7 (value 89).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value for item 4 (value 86), but already allocated.
   - Next highest value for item 2 (value 81).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value for item 6 (value 84).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value for item 2 (value 85), but already allocated.
   - Next highest value for item 5 (value 59).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest value for item 5 (value 80), but already allocated.
   - Next highest value for item 6 (value 71), but already allocated.
   - Next highest value for item 7 (value 69).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 5.

7. **Agent 6**: 
   - Highest value for item 0 (value 77).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 6.

Now, let's ensure all 8 items are distributed:

- Items allocated so far: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Remaining items: 1, 3

Let's allocate the remaining items to the agents with the next highest values who haven't received an item yet:

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 2 has a value of 71, but already allocated an item.
  - Agent 3 has a value of 63.
  - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 2 has a value of 76, but already allocated an item.
  - Agent 4 has a value of 50.
  - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Let's present the final allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6, 1],
    "4": [5, 3],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair distribution based on their valuations and all items are allocated.
