Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  31  62  87  26  61  90  14
1   3  55   2  55  42  66  52  55
2  24  96  89  16  89  91  17  82
3  73  83  79  73  54  93  49  74
4  26  81  15  35  92  81   4  31
5   5  27  69  82   3  82  25  13
6  15  89  98  23  56  22   2  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. Since there are 7 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally get at least one item, and one agent will get two items. 

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value for item 6 (90).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 5 (66).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value for item 1 (96).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 5 (93), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 1 (83), but it's also taken. Next is item 7 (74).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value for item 4 (92).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value for item 5 (82), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 3 (82).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value for item 2 (98).

Since Agent 5 and Agent 3 have the same highest value for item 5, and Agent 5's next highest is item 3 (which is also high), it's logical to adjust allocations to give Agent 3 a more balanced allocation.

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated fairly:

- **Agent 0**: Item 6
- **Agent 1**: Item 5
- **Agent 2**: Item 1
- **Agent 3**: Item 7
- **Agent 4**: Item 4
- **Agent 5**: Item 3
- **Agent 6**: Item 2

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item (0):

- **Agent 3**: Since Agent 3 had to settle for a slightly lower valued item earlier, we can give them item 0.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7, 0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, with Agent 3 receiving two items due to their slightly lower individual item valuation compared to others.
