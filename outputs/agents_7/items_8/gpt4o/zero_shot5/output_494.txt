Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  39  56  11  29   5  94  25
1  68   2  33   5  40  41  10  39
2  72  46  50  13  91  80  59  68
3  45   0   3  94  49  68  96  55
4  43   9  33  14  13   6   6  70
5  19  39  20  40  15  80  18  60
6  71   7  16  80  65  14  48   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we will consider each agent's valuations for the items and attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives. Given the constraints, here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. First, let's identify the highest values for each item and allocate them to the corresponding agents if possible.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, while ensuring we don't exceed the total number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it at 72, which is the highest. Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it at 46, the highest. Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 56, the highest. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it at 94, the highest. Assign to Agent 3.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it at 91, the highest. Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 5**: Agent 5 values it at 80, the highest. Assign to Agent 5.
- **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it at 96, the highest. Assign to Agent 3.
- **Item 7**: Agent 4 values it at 70, the highest. Assign to Agent 4.

This allocation gives us:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: [0, 1, 4]
- Agent 3: [3, 6]
- Agent 4: [7]
- Agent 5: [5]
- Agent 6: []

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1, 4],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": []
}
```
