Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  60  94  47  10  22  32  78
1  47  75  49  31  11  15  29  84
2  88  46  80  47   9  39  92  21
3   1  20  51  88  55  69  80  49
4  22  40  50  18   6  55  36  87
5   6  66  76  66  80  12  34   3
6  93  11  41  13  90  32  60  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the constraint of 7 agents and 8 items, not all agents will receive an item, and some will receive more than one.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations first:

1. Agent 2 values item 6 the highest at 92.
2. Agent 6 values item 4 the highest at 90.
3. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 94.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest at 88.
5. Agent 1 values item 7 the highest at 84.
6. Agent 5 values item 4 the highest at 80, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 2 at 76, but it is also taken. The next highest is item 1 at 66.
7. Agent 4 values item 7 the highest at 87, but it is already taken. The next highest is item 5 at 55, which is available.
8. Finally, Agent 0 gets item 0, which is the highest remaining for them.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one of their highest-valued items that are available.

Now, let's allocate these items in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [4]
}
```

This allocation effectively distributes the items to maximize the value for the agents based on their preferences as provided in the table.
