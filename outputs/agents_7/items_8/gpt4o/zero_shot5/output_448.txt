Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  82  12  25  69  15  95  68
1   5   6   0  45  35  78  47  25
2  51  79  31  53   7  64  57  15
3  21  34  80  66  77  17  22  72
4  74  82  41   5  76  75  13  17
5  54  16   7  20   8  75  76  70
6  39  85  58  93  23  10  50   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will use a greedy approach to assign items to agents based on the highest valuations.

Here is one possible fair allocation of items:

1. Agent 6 values item 3 the highest (93), so we allocate item 3 to agent 6.
2. Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (95), so we allocate item 6 to agent 0.
3. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (78), so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (80), so we allocate item 2 to agent 3.
5. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (79), so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
6. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (76), so we allocate item 4 to agent 4.
7. Agent 5 values item 7 the highest (70), so we allocate item 7 to agent 5.
8. The only remaining item is item 0, which we will assign to the agent with the next highest valuation. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 0 (74), so we allocate item 0 to agent 4.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 0],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [3]
