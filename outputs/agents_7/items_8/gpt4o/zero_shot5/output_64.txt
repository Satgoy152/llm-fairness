Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  35   1  94  30  13  35  22
1  62  58  29  95  64  22  82  26
2  65  67  99  43  11   6  81  55
3   2   9  57  95   6  62  88  57
4  89  25  59  79  26  42  45   0
5   5  43  62  87  68   0  57  36
6  57  39  74   6  39  78  60  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 7 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that every agent receives a proportionate share considering their valuations. Given that some agents may have higher valuations for certain items, we will try to maximize fairness by ensuring that each agent gets items they value highly, while ensuring every item is allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Identify the highest-valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction.

Here's a potential fair allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 3 highly, with a score of 94.
- Agent 1 highly values item 3 as well, but their next highest value is item 6 with 82.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly with a score of 99.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly, but since it is taken, item 6 with a score of 88 is the next best.
- Agent 4 values item 0 with a score of 89.
- Agent 5 values item 4 with 68.
- Agent 6 values item 5 with 78.

Considering the above preferences and ensuring each agent gets a chance to receive items they value:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: Item 0
- Agent 5: Item 4
- Agent 6: Item 5

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction with the available items.
