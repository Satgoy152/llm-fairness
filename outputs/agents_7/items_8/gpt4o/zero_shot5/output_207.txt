Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  37   9  48  45  74  71   8
1  29  98  76  31  65  74  32  98
2   1  61  61  90   3   9  24  96
3  82  46  46  64  11  88  18  65
4   2  26  69  38  33  48  76  51
5  42  16  51  43  40   0  34  14
6  10  36  76  81  22  83  31   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 7 agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation that ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated:

1. Agent 0 has high value for items 0 and 6.
2. Agent 1 has high value for items 1 and 7.
3. Agent 2 has a high value for item 3.
4. Agent 3 has high value for item 5.
5. Agent 4 has high value for item 2.
6. Agent 5 has high value for item 4.
7. Agent 6 has high value for item 6, but since it's already allocated to agent 0, we can allocate another available item to agent 6.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed among the agents based on their preferences, as best as possible.
