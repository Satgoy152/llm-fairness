Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  53   9  87  28  72  39  38
1  82  88  94  69  59  78  92   7
2  77  63  75   5  95  99  21  49
3  18  84  57  32  83  51  68  30
4   8  51  30  93  73   4   4  67
5  47  87  22  66  64  24  88  52
6  42  76  74  51  72  20  11  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a manner that considers the valuations of the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 7 agents and 8 items, we can aim for an allocation where one agent receives two items and the others receive one or zero items.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that one agent receives two items, since there are 8 items and only 7 agents.

To achieve this, let's analyze the values for each item:

- Item 0: Highest value is 82 by Agent 1.
- Item 1: Highest value is 88 by Agent 1.
- Item 2: Highest value is 94 by Agent 1.
- Item 3: Highest value is 93 by Agent 4.
- Item 4: Highest value is 95 by Agent 2.
- Item 5: Highest value is 99 by Agent 2.
- Item 6: Highest value is 92 by Agent 1.
- Item 7: Highest value is 67 by Agent 4.

Based on these valuations, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for items 0, 1, 2, and 6. To ensure fairness, let's give Agent 1 two items, which would be items 2 and 6 (the highest two values).
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 3 and 7, so assign these two items to Agent 4.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4 and 5, so assign these two items to Agent 2.
- Item 0 is also highly valued by Agent 1, but since Agent 1 already has two items, we can assign it to the next highest, which is Agent 0.
- Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 1, but since Agent 1 already has two items, we can assign it to the next highest, which is Agent 5.

Now let's ensure each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items is 8:

- Agent 0: Item [0]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: Items [3, 7]
- Agent 5: Item [1]
- Agent 6: []

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3, 7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": []
}
```
