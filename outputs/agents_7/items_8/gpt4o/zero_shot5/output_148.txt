Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 7 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  80  18  53  78  54  12  21
1  64  70  42  41  13  30  56  42
2  30  59  19   9  15  20  74  64
3  16  57  82  98  49   5  85   9
4  62  86  55  81  15  34  41  50
5  54  43  42  37  37  46  51  98
6  71  50  87  90  42  49  72  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (where possible) and all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation that considers the valuations:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Here's the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 6 (Value: 71)
- Item 1: Agent 4 (Value: 86)
- Item 2: Agent 3 (Value: 82)
- Item 3: Agent 3 (Value: 98)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (Value: 78)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (Value: 54)
- Item 6: Agent 3 (Value: 85)
- Item 7: Agent 5 (Value: 98)

Now let's ensure each agent gets at least one item, redistributing if necessary:

- Agent 0: [4, 5]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [2, 3, 6]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [7]
- Agent 6: [0]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 3, 6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring all items are distributed.
