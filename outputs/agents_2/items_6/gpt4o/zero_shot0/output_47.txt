Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  80  31  35  46  52
1  99  78  40   5  62   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [99 78 40  5 62  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and try to maximize the total value received by each agent. One possible approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm to assign items to the agent that values them the most, while ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 99, and Agent 0 values it at 61. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 80, and Agent 1 values it at 78. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 31, and Agent 1 values it at 40. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 35, and Agent 1 values it at 5. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 46, and Agent 1 values it at 62. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 52, and Agent 1 values it at 9. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

Now, ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. In this case, we have allocated 3 items to each agent, which is fair.

The final allocation can be represented as:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value, while each receiving the same number of items.
