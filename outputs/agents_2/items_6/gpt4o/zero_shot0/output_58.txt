Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  91   8  96  32  86
1  37  32  89  17  78  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total value for each agent while ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent. One approach is to use a method similar to the "Hungarian algorithm" for assignment problems, but since there are only two agents and six items, we can manually determine a fair allocation.

Below are the steps to determine the allocation:

1. Consider the values each agent has for all items and try to maximize the total value for each agent.
2. We can try different allocations manually to find one that seems balanced and fair.

Let's analyze the values:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 33
- Item 1: 91
- Item 2: 8
- Item 3: 96
- Item 4: 32
- Item 5: 86

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 37
- Item 1: 32
- Item 2: 89
- Item 3: 17
- Item 4: 78
- Item 5: 68

One potential fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 1, 3 (total value: 33 + 91 + 96 = 220)
- Agent 1 gets items: 2, 4, 5 (total value: 89 + 78 + 68 = 235)

This allocation aims to distribute the items in a way that both agents receive a similar total value, considering their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5]
}
```
