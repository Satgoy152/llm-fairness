Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  23  55  39  36   6
1   8  21  78  68  39  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 8 21 78 68 39 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple algorithm that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Here's one way to approach it:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, but ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 at 8. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 23, Agent 1 at 21. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 at 78. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 at 68. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 at 39. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 at 26. Assign to Agent 1.

Now let's check the item count:
- Agent 0 has 2 items: [0, 1]
- Agent 1 has 4 items: [2, 3, 4, 5]

Since the total number of items needs to be balanced such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and there are 6 items in total, this distribution satisfies this condition.

Finally, here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
