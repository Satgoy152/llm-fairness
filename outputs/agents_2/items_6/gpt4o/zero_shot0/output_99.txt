Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  22  36  91  60  48
1  48  23  83   4  31  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 6 items and 2 agents, each agent should receive 3 items to maintain fairness in numbers.

Let's evaluate the valuations and allocate items accordingly:

Agent 0 Valuations:
- Item 0: 53
- Item 1: 22
- Item 2: 36
- Item 3: 91
- Item 4: 60
- Item 5: 48

Agent 1 Valuations:
- Item 0: 48
- Item 1: 23
- Item 2: 83
- Item 3: 4
- Item 4: 31
- Item 5: 63

To determine a fair allocation, we can employ the following strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring that each agent ends up with 3 items.

2. Start by examining the highest valuation for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 the most.
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 the most.

3. Allocate these items to their respective agents:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 3.
   - Agent 1 gets Item 2.

4. Continue with the next highest valuations, ensuring a fair distribution:
   - Agent 0: Next highest values are for Items 4, 0, and 5.
   - Agent 1: Next highest values are for Items 5, 0, and 4.

5. Distribute the remaining items, ensuring each agent receives a total of 3 items:
   - Agent 0: Allocate Items 3, 4, and 0.
   - Agent 1: Allocate Items 2, 5, and 1.

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 0],
    "1": [2, 5, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items while maximizing their valuation preferences.
