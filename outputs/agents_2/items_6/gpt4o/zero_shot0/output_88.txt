Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  46  77  43   7  89
1   2   3  84   9  87  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 2  3 84  9 87 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets some items. We will use the given valuation table to make the allocations.

Here is the valuation table for clarity:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 37      | 2       |
| 1    | 46      | 3       |
| 2    | 77      | 84      |
| 3    | 43      | 9       |
| 4    | 7       | 87      |
| 5    | 89      | 34      |

Let's analyze the best value allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value: Item 5 (value 89)
   - Next highest: Item 2 (value 77)
   - Next highest: Item 1 (value 46)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value: Item 4 (value 87)
   - Next highest: Item 2 (value 84)
   - Next highest: Item 5 (value 34)

From the above analysis, we can see that both agents value Item 2 highly, but Agent 1 values it slightly more. Similarly, both agents value Item 5, but Agent 0 values it significantly more.

A fair allocation might involve:
- Giving Agent 1 Item 2 since they value it more than Agent 0.
- Giving Agent 0 Item 5 since they value it significantly more.

Let's allocate items based on maximizing the total value for each agent, considering these insights:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 1, 5 (total value: 37 + 46 + 89 = 172)
- **Agent 1:** Items 2, 3, 4 (total value: 84 + 9 + 87 = 180)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a high total value and has an integer number of items.

Here is the fair allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
