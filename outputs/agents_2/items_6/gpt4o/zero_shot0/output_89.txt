Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81   2  39  33  37  96
1  32  21  72  46  57  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can consider each agent's total valuation and aim to distribute the items in a way that attempts to balance these valuations. Here's a step-by-step process for allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Both Agents:**
   - Agent 0: 81 + 2 + 39 + 33 + 37 + 96 = 288
   - Agent 1: 32 + 21 + 72 + 46 + 57 + 71 = 299

2. **Goal:** Try to distribute the items such that the total value received by each agent is as close as possible while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items based on the maximum value for each agent to balance the total valuation.

4. **Allocate Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (96), so assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (72), so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Continue assigning items to balance total value:

     - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 81 for Agent 0, 32 for Agent 1).
     - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 46 for Agent 1, 33 for Agent 0).
     - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 57 for Agent 1, 37 for Agent 0).
     - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 2 for Agent 0, 21 for Agent 1).

5. **Final Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 5] (Total Value: 81 + 2 + 96 = 179)
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 4] (Total Value: 72 + 46 + 57 = 175)

6. **JSON Format Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

By following this allocation, both agents receive a similar total valuation, ensuring a fair distribution of items.
