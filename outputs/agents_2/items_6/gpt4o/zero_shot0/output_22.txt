Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  45  41  44  39  50
1  29  27  77  70  80  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 45 41 44 39 50]
 [29 27 77 70 80 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize fairness. One way to approach this is to use a method that balances the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations.

Given the valuations table:

```
Agent 0: [63, 45, 41, 44, 39, 50]
Agent 1: [29, 27, 77, 70, 80, 26]
```

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 63 + 45 + 41 + 44 + 39 + 50 = 282
- Agent 1 total valuation: 29 + 27 + 77 + 70 + 80 + 26 = 309

We want to allocate items such that the difference in perceived value for each agent is minimized.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Prioritize high-value items per agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items more evenly, with preference for item 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 4 and item 2.

2. **Allocate items to balance perceived total value:**
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).

3. **Distribute remaining items to balance totals:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

After allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1, 5] with values [63, 45, 50] totaling 158.
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 3, 4] with values [77, 70, 80] totaling 227.

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value distribution based on each agent's individual valuation of the items.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation provides a relatively fair distribution based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
