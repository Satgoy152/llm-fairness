Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  61  67  85  91  55
1   6  34   3  36  57  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items. Here is one way to approach this:

1. **Calculate Total Values:** First, calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
   - Agent 0: 48 + 61 + 67 + 85 + 91 + 55 = 407
   - Agent 1: 6 + 34 + 3 + 36 + 57 + 18 = 154

2. **Allocate Items:** Start by examining which items each agent values the most and try to allocate them fairly.

   - Agent 0 values: 
     - Item 4 (91), Item 3 (85), Item 2 (67), Item 1 (61), Item 5 (55), Item 0 (48)
   - Agent 1 values:
     - Item 4 (57), Item 3 (36), Item 1 (34), Item 5 (18), Item 0 (6), Item 2 (3)

3. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign items based on highest values to ensure each agent receives items they value significantly.
   - Allocate items to maximize the total value each agent receives, considering their preferences.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items they value highly: [0, 1, 2, 5]
   - Agent 1 gets items they value most: [3, 4]

This ensures a fair distribution based on the preference and valuation each agent has for the items.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
