Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  17  38  61  40  86
1  69   4  58  39   6  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize fairness. We have 2 agents and 6 items to allocate.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Sum up the total valuation of all items for each agent.
   - Agent 0: 17 + 17 + 38 + 61 + 40 + 86 = 259
   - Agent 1: 69 + 4 + 58 + 39 + 6 + 52 = 228

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**: Begin by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, aiming for balance in total value received.

   - Item 0 (17, 69): Agent 1 values it more.
   - Item 1 (17, 4): Agent 0 values it more.
   - Item 2 (38, 58): Agent 1 values it more.
   - Item 3 (61, 39): Agent 0 values it more.
   - Item 4 (40, 6): Agent 0 values it more.
   - Item 5 (86, 52): Agent 0 values it more.

   Initial allocation:
   - Agent 0: [1, 3, 4, 5]
   - Agent 1: [0, 2]

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Check if the allocation is fair in terms of total value received by each agent.

   - Agent 0 total value: 17 (item 1) + 61 (item 3) + 40 (item 4) + 86 (item 5) = 204
   - Agent 1 total value: 69 (item 0) + 58 (item 2) = 127

   Agent 1 received significantly less value. Let's make an adjustment:

   - Swap item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 1: 
     - New valuation for Agent 0: 17 + 61 + 40 = 118
     - New valuation for Agent 1: 69 + 58 + 86 = 213

   Although Agent 1 now has a higher total valuation, both agents have 3 items, which balances the distribution of items more equitably.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [1, 3, 4]
   - Agent 1: [0, 2, 5]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and balances the distribution of value as much as possible given the constraints.
