Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  66  13  49  43   2
1  91  67   2  44  60  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 67  2 44 60 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use the following approach to allocate items based on the given valuations:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to maximize each agent's total value, ensuring each agent receives a fair share.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [85, 66, 13, 49, 43, 2]
Agent 1: [91, 67, 2, 44, 60, 17]
```

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Value 85
   - Item 1: Value 66
   - Item 3: Value 49

   Total value for Agent 0: 85 + 66 + 49 = 200

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 2: Value 2
   - Item 4: Value 60
   - Item 5: Value 17

   Total value for Agent 1: 2 + 60 + 17 = 79

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of their respective valuations.
