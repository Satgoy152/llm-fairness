Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  55  77  44  57  23
1  78  85  27  62  73  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that each gets an integer number of items, we can consider the total valuation each agent has for all items and aim to balance these valuations as closely as possible.

Let's compute the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 71 + 55 + 77 + 44 + 57 + 23 = 327
- Agent 1's total valuation: 78 + 85 + 27 + 62 + 73 + 94 = 419

Given that there are 6 items, each agent should ideally receive 3 items. Let's try to allocate the items to balance the total valuations.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0, 2, and 5
   - Total valuation: 71 (item 0) + 77 (item 2) + 23 (item 5) = 171

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items 1, 3, and 4
   - Total valuation: 85 (item 1) + 62 (item 3) + 73 (item 4) = 220

Although this allocation isn't perfectly balanced, it's relatively fair based on the constraint of integer item allocation. The goal is to minimize the difference in total valuation between the agents.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly balance the total valuations each agent receives.
