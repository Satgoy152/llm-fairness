Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  19  93  63  19  91
1  20  20  30  15  26  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can try to distribute the items such that the total value of the items for each agent is as balanced as possible. We have two agents and six items. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to the items:
   - Agent 0: 71 + 19 + 93 + 63 + 19 + 91 = 356
   - Agent 1: 20 + 20 + 30 + 15 + 26 + 92 = 203

2. Our goal is to allocate items such that the value for each agent is as balanced as possible. 

3. A potential fair allocation could be:
   - Assign items 0, 2, and 5 to Agent 0.
   - Assign items 1, 3, and 4 to Agent 1.

Let's check the total values with this allocation:
- Agent 0: 71 (item 0) + 93 (item 2) + 91 (item 5) = 255
- Agent 1: 19 (item 1) + 63 (item 3) + 19 (item 4) = 101

This allocation, while not perfectly balanced in terms of total value, gives each agent three items, and it tries to balance the value reasonably.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers both the number of items and attempts to distribute the total value as fairly as possible.
