Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  10  82  78  97  88
1  60  51   9  44  39  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Understand the Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values the items as follows: [47, 10, 82, 78, 97, 88]
   - Agent 1 values the items as follows: [60, 51, 9, 44, 39, 54]

2. **Determine Total Valuations:**
   - Total valuation for each item by both agents:
     - Item 0: 47 + 60 = 107
     - Item 1: 10 + 51 = 61
     - Item 2: 82 + 9 = 91
     - Item 3: 78 + 44 = 122
     - Item 4: 97 + 39 = 136
     - Item 5: 88 + 54 = 142

3. **Allocate Items to Maximize Fairness:**
   - We aim to give each agent a set of items that maximizes their perceived value while keeping the allocations balanced in terms of the number of items.
   - Since there are 6 items and 2 agents, each agent should receive 3 items.

4. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: Highest valuation items are 4, 2, 5
   - Agent 1: Highest valuation items are 0, 1, 5

5. **Resolve Conflicts and Finalize Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value item 5 highly. We need to resolve this by looking at other allocations:
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 since they have higher value for it.
   - Remaining items for Agent 0: 4, 2, 3 (next highest values for Agent 0)
   - Remaining items for Agent 1: 0, 1, 5

6. **Final Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 4]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 5]

Finally, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
