Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  38  96  73  31  49
1  13  44  27  40  75  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuations for all agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. In this case, we have two agents and six items. Here's a simple approach to achieve a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **List the items by each agent's valuation:**

   - Agent 0's valuations: [83, 38, 96, 73, 31, 49]
   - Agent 1's valuations: [13, 44, 27, 40, 75, 41]

2. **Determine the optimal allocation:**

   - Prioritize the allocation of items based on the highest valuation from each agent's perspective while ensuring fairness.
   - Consider that each agent should receive at least 2 items because there are 6 items and 2 agents.

3. **Allocate items:**

   - Assign the item with the highest value to the agent who values it most, ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

   - Initial allocations based on highest values:
     - Agent 0 gets: Item 2 (value 96), Item 0 (value 83)
     - Agent 1 gets: Item 4 (value 75), Item 1 (value 44)

   - Distribute remaining items fairly:
     - Agent 0: Item 3 (value 73)
     - Agent 1: Item 5 (value 41)

4. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 3],
    "1": [4, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives three items, and it attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives based on the available information.
