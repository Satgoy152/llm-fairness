Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  62  28  75  91  21
1  26  19  11  56  90  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, we'll aim for a balanced approach, where each agent is satisfied with their allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [66, 62, 28, 75, 91, 21]
- Agent 1's valuations: [26, 19, 11, 56, 90, 23]

We need to allocate 6 items (0 to 5) between the two agents. We'll start by identifying the highest value items for each agent, ensuring that the total number of items allocated to each agent remains fair.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Assign items based on highest individual valuations:**
   - Item 4 is highly valued by both agents, but Agent 0 values it slightly higher (91 vs. 90). We'll allocate it to Agent 0.
   - Item 0 is also highly valued by Agent 0 (66), and less by Agent 1 (26), so assign it to Agent 0.
   - Item 3 is valued higher by Agent 0 (75) than by Agent 1 (56), so assign it to Agent 0.

2. **Allocate remaining items to balance the number of items:**
   - Now Agent 0 has 3 items, and Agent 1 has none. We need to allocate the remaining items while considering Agent 1's preferences.
   - Item 5 is valued more by Agent 1 (23) than Agent 0 (21), so assign it to Agent 1.
   - Item 1 is valued more by Agent 0 (62) than by Agent 1 (19), but to balance, we'll give it to Agent 1.
   - Item 2 is valued more by Agent 0 (28) than by Agent 1 (11), but to balance, we'll give it to Agent 1.

With this allocation, each agent receives 3 items, and the allocation is as fair as possible based on the given valuations.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the items while considering the valuations provided by each agent.
