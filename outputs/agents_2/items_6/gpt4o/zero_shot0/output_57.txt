Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  97  43  87  85  47
1  79  48  59  10  43  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations provided, let's analyze possible allocations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 2
- Item 1: 97
- Item 2: 43
- Item 3: 87
- Item 4: 85
- Item 5: 47

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 79
- Item 1: 48
- Item 2: 59
- Item 3: 10
- Item 4: 43
- Item 5: 24

A potential approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them most, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (79 vs 2).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (97 vs 48).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (59 vs 43).
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (87 vs 10).
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (85 vs 43).
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (47 vs 24).

Now, count the items:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 4, 5 (4 items)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2 (2 items)

This allocation results in Agent 0 having more items than Agent 1. Let's adjust to make it more balanced:

Allocate:
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 5
- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 4

Now each agent receives 3 items:

The allocations are:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
