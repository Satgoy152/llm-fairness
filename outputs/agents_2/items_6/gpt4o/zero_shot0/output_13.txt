Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  66   4  16  44  15
1  79  81  45  12  61  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will use a method to balance the total value received by each agent as closely as possible.

Given the valuations:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 44      | 79      |
| 1    | 66      | 81      |
| 2    | 4       | 45      |
| 3    | 16      | 12      |
| 4    | 44      | 61      |
| 5    | 15      | 86      |

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values at 44, Agent 1 at 79.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values at 66, Agent 1 at 81.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values at 4, Agent 1 at 45.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values at 16, Agent 1 at 12.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values at 44, Agent 1 at 61.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values at 15, Agent 1 at 86.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

After this allocation, Agent 1 receives a significantly higher total value. To balance, let's swap some allocations to make the distribution fairer:

- Swap Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Swap Item 5 to Agent 0.

Re-evaluating the allocations:

Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 5
Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 4

Hereâ€™s the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
