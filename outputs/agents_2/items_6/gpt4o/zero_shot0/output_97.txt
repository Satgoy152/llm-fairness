Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84   5   5  79  17  74
1  70  49  24  81  12  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that both agents feel satisfied with their allocated items based on their valuations.

Let's consider the valuation matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 84     | 5      | 5      | 79     | 17     | 74     |
| 1     | 70     | 49     | 24     | 81     | 12     | 21     |

We can approach this by looking at the highest values first and allocating those items to the respective agents, ensuring that each agent doesn't end up with more than three items (since there are two agents and six items).

1. **Agent 0** values Item 0 and Item 3 highly (84 and 79, respectively).
2. **Agent 1** values Item 3 highly but slightly less than Agent 0 (81 vs. 79), and Item 1 highly (49).

Let's allocate:
- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 3, and 5 (values: 84, 79, 74)
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 2, and 4 (values: 49, 24, 12)

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent given their preferences. Here's the result in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This solution ensures that each agent receives three items, and the allocation respects their preferences as much as possible based on their valuation matrix.
