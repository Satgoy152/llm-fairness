Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5   1  14  59  67  95
1  54  56  71  97  19  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider both the total value and the number of items each agent receives. Since there are 6 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0's total value: 5 + 1 + 14 + 59 + 67 + 95 = 241
- Agent 1's total value: 54 + 56 + 71 + 97 + 19 + 53 = 350

The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives as close as possible to half of the total value they assign to all items, while also ensuring each agent gets 3 items.

A possible allocation can be done by considering the individual item values for each agent and trying to balance the total value:

1. **Allocate items to Agent 0:**
   - Choose items with higher value for Agent 0 (but try not to exceed half of their total value).
   - Items 3, 4, and 5 have high values for Agent 0.

2. **Allocate items to Agent 1:**
   - Choose items with higher value for Agent 1 (but try not to exceed half of their total value).
   - Items 0, 1, and 2 are relatively high for Agent 1.

Let's evaluate this approach:

- Agent 0 receives items [3, 4, 5]:
  - Total value: 59 + 67 + 95 = 221

- Agent 1 receives items [0, 1, 2]:
  - Total value: 54 + 56 + 71 = 181

This allocation gives Agent 0 a higher value, but it ensures each agent gets 3 items. If we try to swap items to balance values more evenly, we might end up with an unbalanced number of items per agent. 

Thus, the allocation that fairly balances the items numerically is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
