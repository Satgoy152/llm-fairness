Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  15  99  91  11  28
1  73   8  38  77  36  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. We need to ensure that each agent gets a similar total value, while also giving each agent an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 52 + 15 + 99 + 91 + 11 + 28 = 296
   - Agent 1: 73 + 8 + 38 + 77 + 36 + 29 = 261

2. Our goal is to split the items so that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

3. Since there are 6 items, each agent should receive 3 items.

Based on the valuations, let's try to allocate items to balance the total value as much as possible:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (99), followed by item 3 (91). Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (73), followed by item 3 (77). 
- We should try giving Agent 0 their highest valued items and Agent 1 their highest valued items, balancing the total value they receive.

An allocation could be:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 5] which gives a total value of 52 + 99 + 28 = 179
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 4] which gives a total value of 8 + 77 + 36 = 121

This allocation is not perfectly balanced, but given the constraints, this is an attempt to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 179 and Agent 1 a total value of 121, considering their respective valuations of the items.
