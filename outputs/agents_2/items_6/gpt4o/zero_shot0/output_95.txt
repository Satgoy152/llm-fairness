Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  20  46  25  64  23
1  46  99  57  36  31  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46 99 57 36 31 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives given their valuations.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [42, 20, 46, 25, 64, 23]
- Agent 1's valuations: [46, 99, 57, 36, 31, 45]

Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive for various allocations and aim for a fair distribution:

1. **Initial allocation based on highest value:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (46 vs. 42)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (99 vs. 20)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (57 vs. 46)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (25 vs. 36)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (64 vs. 31)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (23 vs. 45)

**Rebalance for fairness:**

- Agent 1 currently has 3 items (0, 1, 2) and Agent 0 has 3 items (3, 4, 5). However, this allocation is not fair, as Agent 1 has significantly higher total value.

2. **Rebalance by swapping items to equalize value:**
   - Swap Item 2 from Agent 1 to Agent 0, and Item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

**Final allocation:**

- Agent 0: [2, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 5]

Now let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each receives an integer number of items.
