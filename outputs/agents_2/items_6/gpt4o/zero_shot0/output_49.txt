Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  16  12  57  91  32  90
1  32  57  54  84  45  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between two agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to aim for a balanced distribution that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences. Here, we will use a simple method to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Agent**: Sum the valuations each agent has for all the items.
2. **Assign Items**: Assign items to agents based on their relative valuations, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: 16 + 12 + 57 + 91 + 32 + 90 = 298
- **Agent 1**: 32 + 57 + 54 + 84 + 45 + 89 = 361

Now, we will allocate the items in a way that attempts to balance their valuations:

- **Step 1**: Assign the highest valued item for each agent first.

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (91), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 5 (89), so assign item 5 to Agent 1.

- **Step 2**: Assign the second-highest valued items.

- Agent 0's next highest is item 5 (90), but item 5 is already taken by Agent 1. Assign item 2 (57) to Agent 0.
- Agent 1's next highest is item 1 (57), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.

- **Step 3**: Assign remaining items considering balance.

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 (32 vs 45).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (16 vs 32) to keep the number of items balanced.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0.

At this stage, both agents have 3 items each. Let's check the final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4, 5]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
