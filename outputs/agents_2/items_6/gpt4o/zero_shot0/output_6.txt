Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  68  31  32  84  57
1  76  57  89  86  73  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[23 68 31 32 84 57]
 [76 57 89 86 73 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total value while keeping the number of items allocated to each agent balanced. Given that there are 6 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [23, 68, 31, 32, 84, 57]
- Agent 1 values: [76, 57, 89, 86, 73, 90]

To allocate items fairly, we can use a greedy approach by considering the difference in valuations for each item and assigning items to the agent with the higher valuation for that item, prioritizing items with the largest valuation difference first. We'll then adjust as needed to ensure each agent gets exactly 3 items.

1. Calculate the differences in valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: 76 - 23 = 53 (Agent 1 prefers)
   - Item 1: 68 - 57 = 11 (Agent 0 prefers)
   - Item 2: 89 - 31 = 58 (Agent 1 prefers)
   - Item 3: 86 - 32 = 54 (Agent 1 prefers)
   - Item 4: 84 - 73 = 11 (Agent 0 prefers)
   - Item 5: 90 - 57 = 33 (Agent 1 prefers)

2. Sort items by the absolute value of the differences:
   - Item 2 (58), Item 3 (54), Item 0 (53), Item 5 (33), Item 1 (11), Item 4 (11)

3. Allocate items based on preference and balance:
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 0 (highest differences favor Agent 1)
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 4, 5 (remaining items)

Now both agents get 3 items each. Let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
