Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  52   9  92  43  37
1  58  37  41  29  26  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent and ensure that each agent receives an equitable share of the total value while also ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. 

Here's one way to do that:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 59 + 52 + 9 + 92 + 43 + 37 = 292
   - Agent 1: 58 + 37 + 41 + 29 + 26 + 91 = 282

2. We want to allocate the items such that the total value each agent receives is as equal as possible. 

3. Let's try to assign the items one by one, focusing on maximizing fairness and ensuring each agent's total value is balanced.

After considering the possibilities, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, and 4.
  - Total value for Agent 0: 59 + 92 + 43 = 194

- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, and 5.
  - Total value for Agent 1: 37 + 41 + 91 = 169

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a relatively balanced total value based on their own valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
