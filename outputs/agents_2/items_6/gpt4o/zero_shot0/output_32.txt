Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  29  77   6   5  36
1  78  59  11  12  53  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and aim to maximize the total utility for each agent. One common method is to use a fairness criterion like the "envy-freeness" or "max-min fairness." However, given the simplicity of this case (only two agents and six items), a greedy approach to maximize each agent's utility can also be effective.

Let's start by listing the value each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0: [90, 29, 77, 6, 5, 36]
- Agent 1: [78, 59, 11, 12, 53, 26]

Now we will try to allocate the items such that each agent receives an equal number of items (3 each) while maximizing their satisfaction.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 90.
   - Agent 1 values it at 78.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (since 90 > 78).

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 29.
   - Agent 1 values it at 59.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (since 59 > 29).

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 77.
   - Agent 1 values it at 11.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (since 77 > 11).

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 6.
   - Agent 1 values it at 12.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (since 12 > 6).

5. **Item 4:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 5.
   - Agent 1 values it at 53.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (since 53 > 5).

6. **Item 5:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 36.
   - Agent 1 values it at 26.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (since 36 > 26).

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 1 receives items: [1, 3, 4]

Presented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
