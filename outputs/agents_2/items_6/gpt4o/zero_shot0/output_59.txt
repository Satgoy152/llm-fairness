Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  11  96   3  76  34
1  52  49  94  56   8  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use an approach that considers each agent's valuation of the items. A common method is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

First, let's evaluate the total value for each agent if they were to receive each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: [37, 11, 96, 3, 76, 34]
- Agent 1's valuations: [52, 49, 94, 56, 8, 26]

To make a fair allocation, consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while distributing the items evenly:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent by alternating selections based on who values the item more.

2. Calculate the maximum possible value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets 3 items since there are 6 items and 2 agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Item 2 (valued at 96 by Agent 0 and 94 by Agent 1) is assigned to Agent 0 since 96 > 94.
- Item 0 (valued at 37 by Agent 0 and 52 by Agent 1) is assigned to Agent 1 since 52 > 37.
- Item 4 (valued at 76 by Agent 0 and 8 by Agent 1) is assigned to Agent 0 since 76 > 8.
- Item 3 (valued at 3 by Agent 0 and 56 by Agent 1) is assigned to Agent 1 since 56 > 3.
- Item 5 (valued at 34 by Agent 0 and 26 by Agent 1) is assigned to Agent 0 since 34 > 26.
- Item 1 (valued at 11 by Agent 0 and 49 by Agent 1) is assigned to Agent 1 since 49 > 11.

Therefore, the fair allocation of items is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
