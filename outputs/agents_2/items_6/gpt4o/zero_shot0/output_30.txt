Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  95  82  47  60  95
1  43  12  56  70  27  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [43 12 56 70 27 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [30, 95, 82, 47, 60, 95]
- Agent 1 values: [43, 12, 56, 70, 27, 61]

We have a total of 6 items, so each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Initial Allocations:**
   - Assign items based on the highest value for each agent.

2. **Allocation Process:**
   - Agent 0 should get the items with his highest values: 1 (95), 5 (95), and 2 (82).
   - Agent 1 should get the items with his highest values: 3 (70), 0 (43), and 4 (27).

3. **Review and Adjustments:**
   - Ensure each agent has exactly 3 items, which they do in this allocation.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 2],
    "1": [3, 0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives three items, maximizing their total valuation.
