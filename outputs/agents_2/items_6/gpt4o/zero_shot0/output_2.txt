Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  31  14  19  15  59
1  23  95  90  75  86  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [23 95 90 75 86 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach to fair division is to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from their items. Here, we will try to allocate items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [6, 31, 14, 19, 15, 59]
- Agent 1's valuations: [23, 95, 90, 75, 86, 89]

We can sum up the total values each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 6 + 31 + 14 + 19 + 15 + 59 = 144
- Total value for Agent 1: 23 + 95 + 90 + 75 + 86 + 89 = 458

Since Agent 1 values all items much higher overall, we should try to allocate items that maximize the satisfaction for each agent.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

1. Assign items to Agent 0 that they value relatively higher compared to Agent 1, and vice versa.
2. Try to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 3] (Values: 6, 31, 19)
- Agent 1: [2, 4, 5] (Values: 90, 86, 89)

Let's check the total valuation for this allocation:

- Total value for Agent 0: 6 + 31 + 19 = 56
- Total value for Agent 1: 90 + 86 + 89 = 265

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share of their respective valued items, considering Agent 1 has generally higher valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5]
}
```
