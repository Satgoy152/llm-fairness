Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4  5
0   1  63  36  20  23  3
1  59  70  83  80  93  2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the value each agent assigns to each item:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 1
- Item 1: 63
- Item 2: 36
- Item 3: 20
- Item 4: 23
- Item 5: 3

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 59
- Item 1: 70
- Item 2: 83
- Item 3: 80
- Item 4: 93
- Item 5: 2

One possible approach to achieve a fair allocation is to assign items based on maximizing the total value each agent receives. Let's consider the following allocation:

1. Assign items with higher values to each agent.
2. Ensure the total number of items assigned is equal (or as close as possible).

Let's allocate:

- Give agent 1 the items with the highest valuations that they have: items 2, 3, and 4.
- Give agent 0 the remaining items: 0, 1, and 5.

Calculations:

Agent 0:
- Items: 0, 1, 5
- Total value: 1 + 63 + 3 = 67

Agent 1:
- Items: 2, 3, 4
- Total value: 83 + 80 + 93 = 256

This allocation ensures each agent receives the same number of items (3 each) and agent 1 receives a higher total value, which is fair given their higher valuations for these items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
