Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  63  69  65  42  35
1   4  62  78  47  17  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations. We have two agents and six items, and we need to distribute the items so that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's how we can approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations**: [68, 63, 69, 65, 42, 35]
2. **Agent 1 Valuations**: [4, 62, 78, 47, 17, 48]

We can calculate the total value each agent receives from different allocations and aim for a fair distribution.

### Strategy:
- Assign the items based on the highest valuation by each agent, ensuring each gets 3 items.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 2** is the highest valued by Agent 1 (78), allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 0** is highly valued by Agent 0 (68), allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 3** has a higher value for Agent 0 (65) than Agent 1 (47), allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 1** has a slightly higher value for Agent 0 (63) than Agent 1 (62), allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 5** has a higher value for Agent 1 (48) than Agent 0 (35), allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 4** has a higher value for Agent 1 (17) than Agent 0 (42), allocate to Agent 1.

Now, each agent gets 3 items:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 3]
- Agent 1: [2, 4, 5]

Let's represent the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items, and the allocation is based on maximizing the value each agent receives.
