Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  79  76  19  54  55
1  30  75   4  88  90  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **List the items and their valuations for each agent:**

   - **Agent 0:**
     - Item 0: 21
     - Item 1: 79
     - Item 2: 76
     - Item 3: 19
     - Item 4: 54
     - Item 5: 55

   - **Agent 1:**
     - Item 0: 30
     - Item 1: 75
     - Item 2: 4
     - Item 3: 88
     - Item 4: 90
     - Item 5: 92

2. **Determine the optimal allocation by comparing values:**

   - **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it more at 30 vs. Agent 0's 21.
   - **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it more at 79 vs. Agent 1's 75.
   - **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it significantly more at 76 vs. Agent 1's 4.
   - **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it more at 88 vs. Agent 0's 19.
   - **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it more at 90 vs. Agent 0's 54.
   - **Item 5:** Agent 1 values it more at 92 vs. Agent 0's 55.

3. **Allocate items to maximize each agentâ€™s total value:**

   - **Agent 0 gets:** Item 1 and Item 2 (79 + 76 = 155 total value)
   - **Agent 1 gets:** Item 0, Item 3, Item 4, and Item 5 (30 + 88 + 90 + 92 = 300 total value)

4. **Check if allocation is fair and all items are distributed:**

   - All items are allocated.
   - Agent 0 receives high-value items according to their preference.
   - Agent 1 receives the items they value more.

5. **Present the allocations in the required JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items according to their preferences, maximizing their total perceived value.
