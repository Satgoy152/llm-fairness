Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  21  81  56   5  33
1  48  69  33  21  34   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. A simple approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **List the items and their valuations for each agent:**

   - Agent 0: [93, 21, 81, 56, 5, 33]
   - Agent 1: [48, 69, 33, 21, 34, 0]

2. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 at 48. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 at 69. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 at 33. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 at 21. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 at 34. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 33, Agent 1 at 0. Assign to Agent 0.

3. **Check allocation:**

   - Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 3, 5
   - Agent 1 receives items: 1, 4

Now, let's present these allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent gets the items they value the most, which provides a fair allocation based on their valuations.
