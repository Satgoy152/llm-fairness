Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  72  46  13  21  56
1  94  37  55  31  41  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each one receives an integer number of items. Given we have 2 agents and 6 items, each agent should receive 3 items.

Let's calculate the total valuation for a few possible allocations and choose the one that best distributes the value fairly among the agents.

### Possible Allocations:

**Option 1:**
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 5]
  - Valuation: 90 + 72 + 56 = 218
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 4]
  - Valuation: 55 + 31 + 41 = 127

**Option 2:**
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 4]
  - Valuation: 90 + 72 + 21 = 183
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 5]
  - Valuation: 55 + 31 + 73 = 159

**Option 3:**
- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 5]
  - Valuation: 90 + 13 + 56 = 159
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 4]
  - Valuation: 37 + 55 + 41 = 133

**Option 4:**
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 4]
  - Valuation: 90 + 46 + 21 = 157
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 5]
  - Valuation: 37 + 31 + 73 = 141

### Chosen Allocation:

From the above options, Option 2 seems to be the most balanced in terms of total valuation, as it provides a fair distribution of value between the two agents.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation provides a relatively balanced distribution of total valuations between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives three items.
