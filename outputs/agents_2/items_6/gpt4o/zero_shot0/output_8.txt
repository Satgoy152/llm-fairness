Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  97  86   9   1  70
1  76  33  15  70  67   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations of the items and try to distribute the items in such a way that both agents are satisfied with their allocation. Let's analyze the valuations and make a fair allocation.

### Valuations Table:
- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 42
  - Item 1: 97
  - Item 2: 86
  - Item 3: 9
  - Item 4: 1
  - Item 5: 70

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 76
  - Item 1: 33
  - Item 2: 15
  - Item 3: 70
  - Item 4: 67
  - Item 5: 9

### Strategy:
1. **Identify High Valuation Items:** Prioritize allocating items that have significantly high valuations for one agent compared to the other.
2. **Balance Total Valuations:** Ensure that the total valuation of the items allocated to each agent is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Process:
- **High Valuation Differences:**
  - **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 97, and Agent 1 values it at 33. Assign to Agent 0.
  - **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it at 76, and Agent 0 values it at 42. Assign to Agent 1.
  - **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 86, and Agent 1 values it at 15. Assign to Agent 0.
  - **Item 3:** Both agents have close valuations (9 vs. 70). Assign to Agent 1.
  - **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it significantly more (67 vs. 1). Assign to Agent 1.
  - **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it significantly more (70 vs. 9). Assign to Agent 0.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Items 1, 2, 5
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 3, 4

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations.

### Resulting JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
