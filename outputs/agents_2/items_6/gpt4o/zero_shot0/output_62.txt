Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  29  24  56  27  73
1  75  57  26  29   6  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total utility or value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a method like the "max-min fairness" or "envy-free" allocation to distribute the items.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Values for Each Item:**
   - Agent 0 values: [56, 29, 24, 56, 27, 73]
   - Agent 1 values: [75, 57, 26, 29, 6, 78]

2. **Sort Items by Value Contribution:**
   - For Agent 0: [5, 0, 3, 1, 4, 2]
   - For Agent 1: [5, 0, 1, 3, 2, 4]

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start by allocating the highest value items to each agent, ensuring a fair distribution.

4. **Ensure Fairness:**
   - Check the total value for each agent and make sure the distribution is fair or balanced.

Let's look at a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0 (value: 56)
  - Item 3 (value: 56)
  - Item 4 (value: 27)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 1 (value: 57)
  - Item 2 (value: 26)
  - Item 5 (value: 78)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items, and the total value is distributed fairly.

**Final JSON Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets an integer number of items, and the allocation is done with an attempt to balance the total values each agent receives.
