Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  40  42  25  37  15
1  88  17  52  57   0  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim for an allocation that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while also ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Values:**
   - Agent 0: [97, 40, 42, 25, 37, 15]
   - Agent 1: [88, 17, 52, 57, 0, 82]

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - We will start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Item-by-Item Allocation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 at 88. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 at 17. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 52, Agent 0 at 42. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 57, Agent 0 at 25. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 at 0. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 82, Agent 0 at 15. Assign to Agent 1.

4. **Resulting Allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 5

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value the most, given the constraints.
