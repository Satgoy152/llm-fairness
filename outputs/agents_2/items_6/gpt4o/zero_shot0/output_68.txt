Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  25  61  64  81  23
1  92  15  93  33  76  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we need to consider the total value each agent assigns to the items and try to distribute the items so that each agent gets a fair share of the total value. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**  
   - Agent 0: 74 + 25 + 61 + 64 + 81 + 23 = 328
   - Agent 1: 92 + 15 + 93 + 33 + 76 + 88 = 397

2. **Calculate Each Agent's Fair Share:**  
   - Total value of all items = 328 + 397 = 725
   - Fair share for Agent 0 = 725 / 2 = 362.5
   - Fair share for Agent 1 = 362.5

3. **Allocate Items:**  
   We will start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that the total value received by each agent is as close to their fair share as possible.

   - **Allocate to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values items with higher numbers, so we can start from the top:
     - Allocate item 2 (value 93) to Agent 1.
     - Allocate item 5 (value 88) to Agent 1.
     - Allocate item 0 (value 92) to Agent 1.
     - Total value for Agent 1 = 93 + 88 + 92 = 273

   - **Allocate to Agent 0:** With the remaining items, aim to reach as close as possible to their fair share:
     - Allocate item 4 (value 81) to Agent 0.
     - Allocate item 3 (value 64) to Agent 0.
     - Allocate item 1 (value 25) to Agent 0.
     - Total value for Agent 0 = 81 + 64 + 25 = 170

4. **Re-Adjust if Necessary:**  
   Since total values aren't perfectly aligned with the fair share, we can re-evaluate the allocation. We can switch some items if necessary to achieve a closer balance, but given the limited items, this is a starting allocation.

5. **Final Allocation:**  
   Based on the above allocations, a reasonable distribution is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
