Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87   0  87  97  81  54
1  85  71  41  80   0  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to use an algorithm like the "Greedy Allocation" or "Envy-free Allocation," but given the small number of agents and items, we can manually determine a fair allocation by ensuring each agent receives items that maximize their total value.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [87, 0, 87, 97, 81, 54]
- Agent 1: [85, 71, 41, 80, 0, 89]

Steps for allocation:
1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Try to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values are item 3 (97) and items 0 and 2 (both 87).
   - Allocate item 3 (97) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values are item 0 (85) and item 5 (89).
   - Allocate item 5 (89) to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining items**: 0, 1, 2, 4
   - Allocate item 0 (87) to Agent 0, as it is one of their highest values.
   - Allocate item 1 (71) and item 4 (80) to Agent 1, maximizing their remaining values.
   - Allocate item 2 (87) to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0, Item 2, Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 1, Item 4, Item 5

Now, format the allocation in the requested JSON structure:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while distributing the items fairly based on their preferences.
