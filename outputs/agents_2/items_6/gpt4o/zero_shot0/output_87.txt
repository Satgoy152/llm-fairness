Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  26  56  19   4  31
1  93  72  49   2  25  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: \(68 + 26 + 56 + 19 + 4 + 31 = 204\)
   - Agent 1's total valuation: \(93 + 72 + 49 + 2 + 25 + 36 = 277\)

2. **Sort Items by Valuation Difference:**
   - Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
   - Item 0: \(93 - 68 = 25\)
   - Item 1: \(72 - 26 = 46\)
   - Item 2: \(49 - 56 = -7\)
   - Item 3: \(2 - 19 = -17\)
   - Item 4: \(25 - 4 = 21\)
   - Item 5: \(36 - 31 = 5\)

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start by allocating items where the valuation difference is the greatest, to the agent who values it more.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it much higher).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it much higher).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it higher, but close).
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it slightly less, but helps balance).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it higher).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it higher).

4. **Check Fairness:**
   - Agent 0's allocations: Items [2, 3, 5] with a total valuation of \(56 + 19 + 31 = 106\)
   - Agent 1's allocations: Items [0, 1, 4] with a total valuation of \(93 + 72 + 25 = 190\)

5. **Balance Adjustments:**
   - Adjust if needed by swapping items to achieve a closer balance. In this case, given the strong preference disparity, a close balance isn't achievable purely by swapping without leaving one agent with no items.

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [2, 3, 5]
   - Agent 1: [0, 1, 4]

The final allocation in JSON format is:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the total perceived value by each agent, given the constraints of the problem.
