Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  89  43  28  39  34
1  64  13  79  89  48  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to balance the value each agent receives. Let's calculate the total value each agent would get with different allocations and aim for a close balance.

### Valuation Table
- Agent 0: [2, 89, 43, 28, 39, 34]
- Agent 1: [64, 13, 79, 89, 48, 72]

### Total Valuation
- Total value of items:
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 1: 102
  - Item 2: 122
  - Item 3: 117
  - Item 4: 87
  - Item 5: 106

### Fair Allocation Strategy

Considering the valuations, let's allocate the items to achieve a balance:

1. **Agent 0** should receive:
   - Item 1 (89)
   - Item 4 (39)
   - Item 5 (34)

2. **Agent 1** should receive:
   - Item 0 (64)
   - Item 2 (79)
   - Item 3 (89)

This allocation gives:

- **Agent 0**: Total value = 89 + 39 + 34 = 162
- **Agent 1**: Total value = 64 + 79 + 89 = 232

This allocation seeks to balance the total value received by each agent as closely as possible given the integer constraints.

### JSON Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This is the allocation of items to agents that attempts to balance their perceived values of the items.
