Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  94  16  75  25  20
1  24  94  97  70  59  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [24 94 97 70 59 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for the different items. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent given their respective valuations.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item by each agent.
2. Assign items to the agent that values them the most, ensuring each agent gets three items since there are six items in total.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [43, 94, 16, 75, 25, 20]
- Agent 1: [24, 94, 97, 70, 59, 88]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 values it at 24. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Both agents value it at 94. Allocate to Agent 0 or 1. (We'll assign to Agent 0 for balance.)
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 16, Agent 1 values it at 97. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 values it at 70. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 values it at 59. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 values it at 88. Allocate to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4, 5]

The allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5]
}
```
