Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  24  28  60  61  33
1   2   1  68  87  81  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a variety of methods, such as maximizing the total value each agent receives or balancing the distribution of items based on their valuations. In this case, we can aim to balance the total value each agent receives from their assigned items.

Given the valuations:

Agent 0: [79, 24, 28, 60, 61, 33]
Agent 1: [2, 1, 68, 87, 81, 58]

We can try to allocate the items to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation:

- Assign items based on maximizing each agent's preference while trying to keep the total valuation balanced.
- Consider the high-value items for each agent and distribute them accordingly.
  
Let's attempt an allocation:

1. Agent 0 should receive items that maximize their total valuation.
2. Agent 1 should receive items that maximize their total valuation.

Based on the valuations, a reasonable allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items {0, 1, 5}, which totals 79 + 24 + 33 = 136.
- Agent 1 receives items {2, 3, 4}, which totals 68 + 87 + 81 = 236.

Let's format this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.
