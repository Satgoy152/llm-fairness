Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  55  44  73  54  37
1  76  84  49  55  69   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to find an allocation that balances the total value each agent receives. Here's one approach to achieve that:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate the items such that the difference in total value received by each agent is minimized.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

Agent 0's total value:  
57 (item 0) + 55 (item 1) + 44 (item 2) + 73 (item 3) + 54 (item 4) + 37 (item 5) = 320

Agent 1's total value:  
76 (item 0) + 84 (item 1) + 49 (item 2) + 55 (item 3) + 69 (item 4) + 2 (item 5) = 335

Next, we try to distribute the items such that each agent's total value is as close as possible. One way to approach this is by assigning items in a way that balances their total valuations:

- Assign items to Agent 0: [0, 1, 5]
- Assign items to Agent 1: [2, 3, 4]

Now, let's calculate the total value for each agent under this allocation:

Agent 0's value with items [0, 1, 5]:  
57 (item 0) + 55 (item 1) + 37 (item 5) = 149

Agent 1's value with items [2, 3, 4]:  
49 (item 2) + 55 (item 3) + 69 (item 4) = 173

The allocation is not perfectly balanced, but it gives each agent a reasonable share of the total value.

Finally, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
