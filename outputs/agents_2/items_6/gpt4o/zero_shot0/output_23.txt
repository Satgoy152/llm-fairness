Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  73  87  66  72  42
1  71  14  40  78  17  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives, given their valuations of the items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 17 + 73 + 87 + 66 + 72 + 42 = 357
   - Agent 1: 71 + 14 + 40 + 78 + 17 + 35 = 255

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Maximum Valuations:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (71 vs 17)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (73 vs 14)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (87 vs 40)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (78 vs 66)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (72 vs 17)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (42 vs 35)

4. **Check for Fairness and Balance:**
   - After initial allocation, calculate the total value each agent receives:
     - Agent 0: 73 + 87 + 72 + 42 = 274
     - Agent 1: 71 + 78 = 149
   - The allocation is not balanced, so further adjustments are needed.

5. **Adjust Allocation for Fairness:**
   - Swap item 0 (valued higher by agent 1) with item 5 (valued lower by agent 1):
     - Agent 0: 73 + 87 + 72 = 232
     - Agent 1: 71 + 78 + 42 = 191
   - The allocation is now more balanced but still not completely fair.

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - One more swap is needed to ensure fairness:
     - Swap item 4 (valued higher by agent 0) with item 1 (valued lower by agent 1):
     - Agent 0: 87 + 72 + 42 = 201
     - Agent 1: 71 + 78 + 73 = 222

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The values are now fairly balanced between both agents.

**Final Allocations:**
```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation provides a fair distribution of items based on the agents' valuations.
