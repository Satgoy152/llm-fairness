Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  64  30  26  26  31
1  73  82  65  37  31  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each gets an integer number of items, we can use the "maximum sum" method, where each agent gets the items that maximize their total valuation. Since there are 6 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally get 3 items.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent would get for different combinations of 3 items:

### Agent 0
- Combination 1: Items [0, 1, 2] = 25 + 64 + 30 = 119
- Combination 2: Items [0, 1, 3] = 25 + 64 + 26 = 115
- Combination 3: Items [0, 1, 4] = 25 + 64 + 26 = 115
- Combination 4: Items [0, 1, 5] = 25 + 64 + 31 = 120
- Combination 5: Items [0, 2, 3] = 25 + 30 + 26 = 81
- Combination 6: Items [0, 2, 4] = 25 + 30 + 26 = 81
- Combination 7: Items [0, 2, 5] = 25 + 30 + 31 = 86
- Combination 8: Items [0, 3, 4] = 25 + 26 + 26 = 77
- Combination 9: Items [0, 3, 5] = 25 + 26 + 31 = 82
- Combination 10: Items [0, 4, 5] = 25 + 26 + 31 = 82
- Combination 11: Items [1, 2, 3] = 64 + 30 + 26 = 120
- Combination 12: Items [1, 2, 4] = 64 + 30 + 26 = 120
- Combination 13: Items [1, 2, 5] = 64 + 30 + 31 = 125
- Combination 14: Items [1, 3, 4] = 64 + 26 + 26 = 116
- Combination 15: Items [1, 3, 5] = 64 + 26 + 31 = 121
- Combination 16: Items [1, 4, 5] = 64 + 26 + 31 = 121
- Combination 17: Items [2, 3, 4] = 30 + 26 + 26 = 82
- Combination 18: Items [2, 3, 5] = 30 + 26 + 31 = 87
- Combination 19: Items [2, 4, 5] = 30 + 26 + 31 = 87
- Combination 20: Items [3, 4, 5] = 26 + 26 + 31 = 83

### Agent 1
- Combination 1: Items [0, 1, 2] = 73 + 82 + 65 = 220
- Combination 2: Items [0, 1, 3] = 73 + 82 + 37 = 192
- Combination 3: Items [0, 1, 4] = 73 + 82 + 31 = 186
- Combination 4: Items [0, 1, 5] = 73 + 82 + 68 = 223
- Combination 5: Items [0, 2, 3] = 73 + 65 + 37 = 175
- Combination 6: Items [0, 2, 4] = 73 + 65 + 31 = 169
- Combination 7: Items [0, 2, 5] = 73 + 65 + 68 = 206
- Combination 8: Items [0, 3, 4] = 73 + 37 + 31 = 141
- Combination 9: Items [0, 3, 5] = 73 + 37 + 68 = 178
- Combination 10: Items [0, 4, 5] = 73 + 31 + 68 = 172
- Combination 11: Items [1, 2, 3] = 82 + 65 + 37 = 184
- Combination 12: Items [1, 2, 4] = 82 + 65 + 31 = 178
- Combination 13: Items [1, 2, 5] = 82 + 65 + 68 = 215
- Combination 14: Items [1, 3, 4] = 82 + 37 + 31 = 150
- Combination 15: Items [1, 3, 5] = 82 + 37 + 68 = 187
- Combination 16: Items [1, 4, 5] = 82 + 31 + 68 = 181
- Combination 17: Items [2, 3, 4] = 65 + 37 + 31 = 133
- Combination 18: Items [2, 3, 5] = 65 + 37 + 68 = 170
- Combination 19: Items [2, 4, 5] = 65 + 31 + 68 = 164
- Combination 20: Items [3, 4, 5] = 37 + 31 + 68 = 136

To maximize the fairness, let's choose the combination that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets 3 items. From our calculations, we find:

- Agent 0 should get items [1, 2, 5] for a total valuation of 125.
- Agent 1 should get items [0, 3, 4] for a total valuation of 141.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
