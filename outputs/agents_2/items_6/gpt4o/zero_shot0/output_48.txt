Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  19  10  75  35  22
1  56  37  43  91  18  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim for an allocation where both agents have a similar total value. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: 85 + 19 + 10 + 75 + 35 + 22 = 246
   - Agent 1: 56 + 37 + 43 + 91 + 18 + 33 = 278

2. **Try to Equalize Total Value by Allocating Items:**

   Let's try to maximize the value for each agent by allocating the items such that the difference in total value between the agents is minimized.

3. **Allocate Items:**

   - Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent and balance as needed.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 because it has the highest value (91) and helps balance the total value.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it has a high value (85) for Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 because it increases the total value for Agent 1 without overbalancing.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 to increase Agent 1's total value further.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 to balance the total value further.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 to finalize the allocation.

4. **Check Final Allocation and Total Values:**

   - Agent 0 has items [0, 4, 5] with total value: 85 + 35 + 22 = 142
   - Agent 1 has items [1, 2, 3] with total value: 37 + 43 + 91 = 171

5. **Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total values each agent receives, given the constraints.
