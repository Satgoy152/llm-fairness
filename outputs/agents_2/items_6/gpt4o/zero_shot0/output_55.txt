Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  99  30  82  94  56
1  78  30  38  43  84  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the items so that the total valuations for each agent are as balanced as possible. Let's evaluate a way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 99  
- Item 1: 99  
- Item 2: 30  
- Item 3: 82  
- Item 4: 94  
- Item 5: 56  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 78  
- Item 1: 30  
- Item 2: 38  
- Item 3: 43  
- Item 4: 84  
- Item 5: 80  

To achieve a fair allocation, we'll need to consider each agent's total valuation for different combinations of items:

Step-by-step allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent first to maximize their individual satisfaction.
2. Balance the remaining items to ensure that neither agent feels they are receiving significantly less value.

Based on this approach, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, and 4.
- Agent 1 highly values items 4, 5, and 0.

Let's try this allocation:

1. Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0 because they have high values for them (99 each).
2. Assign items 4 and 5 to Agent 1 because these items have high values for them (84 and 80).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (82 value).
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (38 value).

Now, let's check the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3] = 99 + 99 + 82 = 280
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4, 5] = 38 + 84 + 80 = 202

While the total valuations are not perfectly balanced, this allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are of high value to them, and the distribution is fairly reasonable given the available options.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5]
}
```
