Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  10  65  95   9  61
1  60  42  50  46  99  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [60 42 50 46 99 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should try to maximize the total perceived value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [51, 10, 65, 95, 9, 61]
- Agent 1: [60, 42, 50, 46, 99, 43]

We have 6 items to allocate between both agents. A fair allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent if they got all items:
   - Agent 0 total value: 51 + 10 + 65 + 95 + 9 + 61 = 291
   - Agent 1 total value: 60 + 42 + 50 + 46 + 99 + 43 = 340

2. Split the items to maximize the total value for each agent while keeping the allocation fair.

Let's try allocating the items:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 95) because it has the highest value for Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 99) because it has the highest value for Agent 1.

Now, consider the remaining items:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 65) and item 0 (value 51), as this maximizes their value.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 61) and item 1 (value 42) to Agent 1.

The allocations maximize the total value for each agent given the constraints:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 2, 3, 5] with a total value of 51 + 65 + 95 + 61 = 272
- Agent 1 gets items: [1, 4] with a total value of 42 + 99 = 141

This allocation may not be perfectly equal in terms of total value but tries to respect each agent's preferences. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
