Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  69   0  73  70  52
1  10  61  42  55  20  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 61 42 55 20 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and attempt to maximize their total perceived value while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the valuations table:

```
Agent\Item  0   1   2   3   4   5
0           90  69   0  73  70  52
1           10  61  42  55  20  15
```

Let's start by examining the highest value items for each agent:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 has relatively high valuations for items 1 and 2.

To achieve a fair allocation, we can follow these steps:

1. Allocate item 0 to agent 0, since it holds the highest value for agent 0.
2. Allocate item 1 to agent 1, as it holds a high value for agent 1.
3. Allocate item 2 to agent 1, as it also holds a reasonable value for agent 1.
4. Allocate item 3 to agent 0, as it holds a high value for agent 0.
5. Allocate item 4 to agent 0, as it holds a high value for agent 0.
6. Allocate item 5 to agent 0, as agent 0 still has a higher value for this item than agent 1.

With this allocation, we try to maximize the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, 4, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
