Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  22  11  64  97  16
1  69  89  28  64  68  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between two agents based on their valuations, we need to consider the total value each agent places on the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 25 (item 0) + 22 (item 1) + 11 (item 2) + 64 (item 3) + 97 (item 4) + 16 (item 5) = 235
- Agent 1: 69 (item 0) + 89 (item 1) + 28 (item 2) + 64 (item 3) + 68 (item 4) + 28 (item 5) = 346

Now, we'll aim to allocate the items such that both agents receive approximately equal total value.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Allocate high-value items first**: This helps in balancing the total valuation quickly.

2. **Iterate through items** and allocate them to the agent who values them more unless it skews the balance significantly.

Let's start the allocation:

1. **Item 4 (97 vs 68):** Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1 (22 vs 89):** Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 0 (25 vs 69):** Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3 (64 vs 64):** Allocate to either, choose Agent 0 for balance.
5. **Item 5 (16 vs 28):** Allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 2 (11 vs 28):** Allocate to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 2, 3, 4
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 1, 5

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items.

{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5]
}
