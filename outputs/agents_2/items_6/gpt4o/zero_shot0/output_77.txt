Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  62  98  79  80  50
1  55  56  89  32  94  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. A common approach to achieve this is through the use of an algorithm that finds an optimal assignment, such as the Hungarian Algorithm or a greedy approach for smaller problems.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
Agent 0: [94, 62, 98, 79, 80, 50]
Agent 1: [55, 56, 89, 32, 94, 47]
```

We aim to allocate the 6 items in a way that maximizes the perceived value for each agent.

### Steps:

1. **Initial Analysis:** 
   - Calculate the total value for each agent if they get all items.
   - Determine which items are highly valued by each agent.

2. **Assignment:**
   - Assign items to the agent that values them more, ensuring each agent gets 3 items since there are 6 items and 2 agents.

3. **Optimization:** 
   - Check if there's a possible swap between items to increase the total value for both agents.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [94 (item 0), 62 (item 1), 98 (item 2), 79 (item 3), 80 (item 4), 50 (item 5)]
   - High-value items: 0, 2, 4

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [55 (item 0), 56 (item 1), 89 (item 2), 32 (item 3), 94 (item 4), 47 (item 5)]
   - High-value items: 4, 2, 1

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 2, 3]
  - Total value: 94 (item 0) + 98 (item 2) + 79 (item 3) = 271

- **Agent 1:** Items [1, 4, 5]
  - Total value: 56 (item 1) + 94 (item 4) + 47 (item 5) = 197

This distribution ensures each agent gets 3 items, and each agent is assigned items they value highly.

### JSON Allocation:

    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
