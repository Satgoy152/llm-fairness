Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  73  24  79  73  18
1  44  42  70  92   3  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. A common approach to achieving fairness is to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. We'll use a simple approach to allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent ends up with three items.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 68.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 44.
   - **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0** since they value it more.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 73.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 42.
   - **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0** since they value it more.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 24.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 70.
   - **Allocate item 2 to Agent 1** since they value it more.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 79.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 92.
   - **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1** since they value it more.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 73.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 3.
   - **Allocate item 4 to Agent 0** since they value it more.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 at 18.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 at 39.
   - **Allocate item 5 to Agent 1** since they value it more.

### Final Allocation:

Now each agent has been allocated three items. Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
