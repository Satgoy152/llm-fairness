Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  86   1  18  51  51
1  88  33  63  18  75  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 33 63 18 75 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. In this case, we have two agents and six items.

Let's first examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 71, 86, 1, 18, 51, 51
Agent 1: 88, 33, 63, 18, 75, 86
```

We can approach this problem using a greedy method, where each agent gets the items they value the most, provided it doesn't result in an unfair distribution. To achieve a fair distribution:

1. Compute the total value each agent places on all items:
   - Agent 0: 71 + 86 + 1 + 18 + 51 + 51 = 278
   - Agent 1: 88 + 33 + 63 + 18 + 75 + 86 = 363

2. Allocate items to each agent considering their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets 3 items each.

Let's start with allocating items:

- **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0: 88.
- **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation for item 1: 86.
- **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation for item 5: 86.
- **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation for item 4: 75.
- **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation for item 2: 63.
- **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation for item 3: 18.

Now let's ensure both agents get 3 items each, fairly maximizing the value:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 3, 4] (Values: 86, 18, 51)
- **Agent 1**: [0, 2, 5] (Values: 88, 63, 86)

Check totals:
- Agent 0: 86 + 18 + 51 = 155
- Agent 1: 88 + 63 + 86 = 237

This allocation is fair since each agent receives 3 items, and the allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total value.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
