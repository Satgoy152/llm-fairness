Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  16  27   5  59   2
1  47  72  72  90  30  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 6 items in total, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 83
   - Item 1: 16
   - Item 2: 27
   - Item 3: 5
   - Item 4: 59
   - Item 5: 2

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 47
   - Item 1: 72
   - Item 2: 72
   - Item 3: 90
   - Item 4: 30
   - Item 5: 27

To fairly allocate items, let's prioritize giving each agent the items they value the most.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 1** highly values items 3, 1, and 2:
   - Item 3: 90
   - Item 1: 72
   - Item 2: 72
   - Allocating items 1, 2, and 3 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 0** will receive the remaining items, 0, 4, and 5:
   - Item 0: 83
   - Item 4: 59
   - Item 5: 2

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive 3 items each. Agent 1 receives the items with the highest total value according to their valuations, while Agent 0 receives the remaining items with the highest total value according to their valuations.
