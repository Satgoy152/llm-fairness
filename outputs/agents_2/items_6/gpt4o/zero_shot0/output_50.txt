Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  50  63  36  83  27
1  59  73  58  70  85   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use the "envy-free" allocation method or the "maximum value" method.

Let's calculate the total value for each possible allocation and choose the one that maximizes fairness, meaning each agent receives a fair share of value, if possible.

Here are the values each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0: [57, 50, 63, 36, 83, 27]
- Agent 1: [59, 73, 58, 70, 85, 9]

We can explore possible allocations:

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items combined.
2. Attempt to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's allocate:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items with values: 57 (item 0), 50 (item 1), 63 (item 2), 27 (item 5)
   - Total value: 57 + 50 + 63 + 27 = 197

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items with values: 70 (item 3), 85 (item 4)
   - Total value: 70 + 85 = 155

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 5, while Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4. This aims to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of their total valuations.
