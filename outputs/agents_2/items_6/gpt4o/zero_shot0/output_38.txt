Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  77  35  17  12  58
1  86  61  67  86  68   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here’s a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 11
   - Item 1: 77
   - Item 2: 35
   - Item 3: 17
   - Item 4: 12
   - Item 5: 58

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 86
   - Item 1: 61
   - Item 2: 67
   - Item 3: 86
   - Item 4: 68
   - Item 5: 8

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a method like the "Envy-Free" approach or similar techniques aimed at maximizing the satisfaction of each agent. Here’s an allocation that balances the values for each agent:

- **Allocate to Agent 0:**
  - Items: 1, 3, 5
  - Total Value: 77 + 17 + 58 = 152

- **Allocate to Agent 1:**
  - Items: 0, 2, 4
  - Total Value: 86 + 67 + 68 = 221

This allocation ensures that both agents get items based on their preferences, with Agent 0 receiving a total value of 152 and Agent 1 receiving a total value of 221.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation allows each agent to maximize their total value based on individual valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
