Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  34  41  57  50  58
1  58   4  39  45  81  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation. A fair allocation strategy could involve maximizing each agent's total valuation for their allocated items.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent would have if they received all items:

- Agent 0: 33 + 34 + 41 + 57 + 50 + 58 = 273
- Agent 1: 58 + 4 + 39 + 45 + 81 + 26 = 253

Since we need to allocate the items fairly, we can use a max-min fairness approach where we try to balance the total valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by giving each agent their highest valued item:
   - Agent 0: Item 5 (value 58)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (value 81)

2. Allocate the remaining items to maximize the minimum valuation each agent receives:
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (value 57), Item 2 (value 41)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (value 58), Item 1 (value 4)

This results in the following allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [5, 3, 2] with total valuation 58 + 57 + 41 = 156
- Agent 1: Items [4, 0, 1] with total valuation 81 + 58 + 4 = 143

While this is one way to allocate the items, it's important to note that different strategies could yield different allocations while still being considered fair. The final allocations in the JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3, 2],
    "1": [4, 0, 1]
}
```
