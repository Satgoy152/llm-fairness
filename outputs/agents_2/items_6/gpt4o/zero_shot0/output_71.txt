Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  90  95  88  87  10
1  81  73  26   6  22  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes their overall satisfaction. There are various methods to achieve fairness, such as maximizing total value, minimizing envy, or ensuring proportionality.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [29, 90, 95, 88, 87, 10]
- Agent 1 values: [81, 73, 26, 6, 22, 87]

We'll try to allocate the items to balance the total value each agent receives. One way to do this is by using a greedy approach, where each agent picks items in descending order of their value until all items are allocated.

### Allocation Process

1. **Initial Total Values**:
   - Agent 0: 0
   - Agent 1: 0

2. **Item Selection**:
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 at 26. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 81, Agent 0 at 29. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 at 73. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 at 6. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 87, Agent 0 at 10. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 at 22. Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [2, 1, 3, 4]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 5]

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the agents receive items that maximize their individual valuations, given the constraints of distributing all items.
