Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1  2   3   4   5
0  56  36  7  28  45  63
1  25   4  2   3  74  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the allocations are as equitable as possible based on the agents' valuations. The goal is to maximize each agent's total valuation from the items they receive while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [56, 36, 7, 28, 45, 63]
Agent 1: [25, 4, 2, 3, 74, 48]
```

1. **Assign the highest valued items to each agent first:**

   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most with 63. Let's assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most with 74. Let's assign item 4 to Agent 1.

2. **Continue assigning based on remaining highest valuations:**

   - Agent 0's next highest is item 0 with 56. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's next highest is item 5 with 48, but it's already taken. The next available highest is item 0 with 25, but that's also taken. Move to the next available, item 1 with 4. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**

   - For Agent 0, the next highest available is item 1 (36), but it's taken by Agent 1. Move to item 4 (45), which is taken. The next available for Agent 0 is item 3 with 28. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - For Agent 1, the next highest available is item 3 (3), but it's taken. Move to item 2 (2). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Final allocations:**

   - Agent 0 has: [5, 0, 3]
   - Agent 1 has: [4, 1, 2]

Now, let's format the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize fairness based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
