Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  42  22   7  87  75
1  41  76  46  35  83   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. We'll use a simple heuristic method to achieve this.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Agents: 0, 1
   - Items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Valuations:
     - Agent 0: [28, 42, 22, 7, 87, 75]
     - Agent 1: [41, 76, 46, 35, 83, 4]

2. **Sort items for each agent based on valuation**:
   - For Agent 0: Items sorted by valuation = [4 (87), 5 (75), 1 (42), 0 (28), 2 (22), 3 (7)]
   - For Agent 1: Items sorted by valuation = [1 (76), 4 (83), 2 (46), 0 (41), 3 (35), 5 (4)]

3. **Allocate items**:
   - Allocate the highest valued item for each agent such that their total valuation remains balanced.
   - Start with the item that has the highest combined valuation and allocate it to the agent who values it the most, unless it significantly disrupts balance.

4. **Allocation Process**:
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (87 vs 83) because it has the highest value for Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (76 vs 42) because it has the highest value for Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (75 vs 4) because it is much more valuable to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (46 vs 22) because it is more valuable to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (28 vs 41) as it balances the total valuation better.
   - Allocate the remaining item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Check balance**:
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 87 + 75 + 28 = 190
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 76 + 46 + 35 = 157

### Allocation Result:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on their valuations while keeping the total valuation for each agent as balanced as possible.
