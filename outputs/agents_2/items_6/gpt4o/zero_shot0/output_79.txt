Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  26  60  46  41  23
1  74  52  86  10  62  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the sum of the values each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One way to do this is by using the concept of maximizing the total value each agent gets, while keeping the number of allocated items balanced.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive if we allocate different combinations of items to them:

Agent 0 values:
- Item 0: 41
- Item 1: 26
- Item 2: 60
- Item 3: 46
- Item 4: 41
- Item 5: 23

Agent 1 values:
- Item 0: 74
- Item 1: 52
- Item 2: 86
- Item 3: 10
- Item 4: 62
- Item 5: 26

We'll try to allocate the items such that the total value each agent gets is as equal as possible.

1. Start by giving agent 1 the item they value the most: Item 2 (value 86).
2. Give agent 0 the item they value the most: Item 2 is already taken, so the next highest is Item 3 (value 46).
3. Allocate items 0 and 1 to agent 1, as agent 1 values them more than agent 0 does. This gives agent 1 items 0, 1, and 2.
4. Allocate items 4 and 5 to agent 0, as agent 0 values them more than agent 1 does.

Now the allocations are:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2

Let's format this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.
