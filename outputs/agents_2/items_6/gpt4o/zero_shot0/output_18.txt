Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  45   7  50  79  16
1  97  73  17  12  55  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. We'll use the valuations provided to guide this allocation.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent would receive if items were initially distributed evenly by count:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: 0, 1, 2
   - Total Value: 81 + 45 + 7 = 133

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: 3, 4, 5
   - Total Value: 12 + 55 + 96 = 163

Clearly, this allocation is not balanced. We'll need to adjust to make the values more balanced.

Upon inspecting the valuations, we notice that agent 1 highly values item 0, and agent 0 values item 4. We can try swapping some items to balance the total value:

- Swap item 0 (from agent 0 to agent 1) and item 3 (from agent 1 to agent 0).
- Swap item 5 (from agent 1 to agent 0) and item 2 (from agent 0 to agent 1).

Let's calculate the new total values:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: 1, 3, 5
   - Total Value: 45 + 50 + 16 = 111

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: 0, 2, 4
   - Total Value: 97 + 17 + 79 = 193

The allocation still seems unbalanced. Let's consider an alternative allocation:

- Allocate items 0, 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate items 1, 2, 3, 5 to Agent 1.

Final calculation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: 0, 4
   - Total Value: 81 + 79 = 160

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: 1, 2, 3, 5
   - Total Value: 73 + 17 + 12 + 96 = 198

This is a reasonable allocation given the constraints, but it still could be better balanced. Allocations are often complex to balance perfectly. However, for the current setup, we will proceed with the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
This allocation attempts to balance the high valuations between the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
