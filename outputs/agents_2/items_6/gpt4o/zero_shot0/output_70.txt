Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  37  27  81  52  24
1  51  54  83  45  64  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the valuations given in the table. One method to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. We can use a greedy approach to allocate items based on the highest valuations.

Here's how we could approach the allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent can get from all items.
2. Assign items to each agent based on who values them the most.

Let's go through the allocation step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations
- For agent 0:
  - Total valuations: \(96 + 37 + 27 + 81 + 52 + 24 = 317\)

- For agent 1:
  - Total valuations: \(51 + 54 + 83 + 45 + 64 + 52 = 349\)

### Step 2: Allocate Items
We will iterate over the items and assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 at 51. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 at 54. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 27, Agent 1 at 83. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 at 45. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 52, Agent 1 at 64. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 at 52. Assign to Agent 1.

### Allocations
After the allocation, we need to ensure that the number of items is balanced between the agents:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 4, 5]

To ensure both agents get exactly 3 items (since there are 6 items total), we can adjust the allocation slightly by reassigning one item:

- We can reassign Item 2 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 to balance the allocation.

### Final Allocation
Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items, and items are allocated based on maximizing their valuations.
