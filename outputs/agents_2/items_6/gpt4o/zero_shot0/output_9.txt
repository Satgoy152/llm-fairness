Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  45  37  66  62  89
1  54  80  93  47  16  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54 80 93 47 16 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. We will consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Given the valuation matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 76     | 45     | 37     | 66     | 62     | 89     |
| 1     | 54     | 80     | 93     | 47     | 16     | 99     |

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 5, and 3.
   - Allocate items: 0, 5, 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2, 1, and 4.
   - Allocate items: 2, 1, 4 to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the valuation totals for each agent:

- **Agent 0's total valuation:**
  - Item 0: 76
  - Item 5: 89
  - Item 3: 66
  - Total: 76 + 89 + 66 = 231

- **Agent 1's total valuation:**
  - Item 2: 93
  - Item 1: 80
  - Item 4: 16
  - Total: 93 + 80 + 16 = 189

While the total valuations are not perfectly balanced, they are fairly distributed based on the original values each agent assigns to the items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 3],
    "1": [2, 1, 4]
}
```
