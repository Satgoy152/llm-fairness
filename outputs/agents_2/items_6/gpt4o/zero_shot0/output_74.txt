Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  99  21  61  83  92
1  38  95   5  17   0  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:** Compute the total valuation each agent has for all the items. This helps in understanding which agent values the items more overall.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Maximum Value:** Start by allocating each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that items are initially distributed to maximize individual satisfaction.

3. **Balance the Allocations:** Adjust the allocations to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and the distribution is as fair as possible.

Let's apply this method to the given valuations:

Valuations:
- Agent 0: [35, 99, 21, 61, 83, 92]
- Agent 1: [38, 95, 5, 17, 0, 48]

**Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations**
- Total for Agent 0: 35 + 99 + 21 + 61 + 83 + 92 = 391
- Total for Agent 1: 38 + 95 + 5 + 17 + 0 + 48 = 203

**Step 2: Initial Allocation Based on Maximum Value**
- Item 0: Agent 1 (38 > 35)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (99 > 95)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (21 > 5)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (61 > 17)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (83 > 0)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (92 > 48)

This initial allocation is heavily skewed towards Agent 0, leaving Agent 1 with only one item. We need to adjust this to balance the allocations.

**Step 3: Balance the Allocations**
To balance, we can reallocate some items from Agent 0 to Agent 1, making sure that the reallocation does not significantly reduce the total value received by Agent 0:

- Reallocate Item 5 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it second highest after Item 0).

Now, let's check the new allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 3, 4] (Values: 99, 21, 61, 83)
- Agent 1: Items [0, 5] (Values: 38, 48)

This allocation gives:
- Total for Agent 0: 99 + 21 + 61 + 83 = 264
- Total for Agent 1: 38 + 48 = 86

Both agents have an integer number of items, and the items are distributed as fairly as possible given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5]
}
```
