Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  50  39   4  93  82
1  12  74  88  52  94  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for the agents, while also ensuring that the allocation is proportional and envy-free if possible.

Here is a method to perform a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 45 + 50 + 39 + 4 + 93 + 82 = 313
   - Agent 1: 12 + 74 + 88 + 52 + 94 + 50 = 370

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - We will aim to distribute the items so that the total valuation is fairly distributed between the agents.
   - Since there are 6 items and 2 agents, ideally each agent should get approximately 3 items.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent in a way that balances the total valuation and the number of items.

Let's attempt to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 4 (value = 93)
  - Item 5 (value = 82)
  - Item 0 (value = 45)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 2 (value = 88)
  - Item 1 (value = 74)
  - Item 3 (value = 52)

4. **Check Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 93 + 82 + 45 = 220
   - Agent 1: 88 + 74 + 52 = 214

The allocation is balanced in terms of total valuation, and each agent gets 3 items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
