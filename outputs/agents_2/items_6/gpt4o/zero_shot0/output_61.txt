Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  25  26  61  16  50
1   9  22  51  22  64  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[59 25 26 61 16 50]
 [ 9 22 51 22 64 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets approximately equal total valuation from the items they receive.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
Agent\Item  0   1   2   3   4   5
0          59  25  26  61  16  50
1           9  22  51  22  64  29
```

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to get all items:

- Agent 0's total value for all items: 59 + 25 + 26 + 61 + 16 + 50 = 237
- Agent 1's total value for all items: 9 + 22 + 51 + 22 + 64 + 29 = 197

A fair allocation would aim to split these totals as evenly as possible between the two agents. 

Let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. Start by allocating the items with the highest difference in valuation in favor of one agent.
2. Consider the remaining items and try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Following this process:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 61) because Agent 0 values it much higher than Agent 1.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 64) because Agent 1 values it much higher than Agent 0.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 59) because Agent 0 values it significantly more.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 51) because Agent 1 values it significantly more.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value 50) because Agent 0 values it more.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 22) because it's the remaining item and gives a better balance.

This results in the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 5 with total value = 59 + 61 + 50 = 170
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 4 with total value = 22 + 51 + 64 = 137

Allocations can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
