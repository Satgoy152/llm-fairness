Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3  4   5
0  51  78  99  57  7  36
1  56  22  65  88  9  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use a method that balances the total value each agent receives, such as the "Envy-Free" or the "Maximin" method. Here, we'll try to allocate items so that the difference in total value for each agent is minimized.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive for different allocations and find a fair distribution:

Agent 0's valuations: [51, 78, 99, 57, 7, 36]
Agent 1's valuations: [56, 22, 65, 88, 9, 89]

We will try to allocate items in a way that balances the total values:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest available value for Agent 0).
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest available value for Agent 1).
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest available value for Agent 0).
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (remaining item).

Let's calculate the total value for each agent:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 0, 1] with values [99, 51, 78] => Total value = 228
- Agent 1: Items [3, 5, 4] with values [88, 89, 9] => Total value = 186

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuation for each agent sequentially, trying to balance the value distribution as much as possible.
