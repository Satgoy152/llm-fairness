Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1  2   3   4   5
0  29  63  4  90   6  92
1  59  68  1  86  71  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [59 68  1 86 71 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each receives an integer number of items. Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1  2   3   4   5
0  29  63  4  90   6  92
1  59  68  1  86  71  73
```

Let's attempt to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Sort items based on their valuation difference**: Calculate the difference in valuations between the two agents for each item.
2. **Assign items with the largest positive difference to the agent that values them more**: Balance the allocation around these key items.

### Valuation Differences for Each Item:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (59) - Agent 0 (29) = 30
- Item 1: Agent 1 (68) - Agent 0 (63) = 5
- Item 2: Agent 1 (1) - Agent 0 (4) = -3
- Item 3: Agent 1 (86) - Agent 0 (90) = -4
- Item 4: Agent 1 (71) - Agent 0 (6) = 65
- Item 5: Agent 1 (73) - Agent 0 (92) = -19

### Allocate Items:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Assign items where Agent 0 has a significantly higher valuation: Item 3 and Item 5.
- **Agent 1**:
  - Assign items where Agent 1 has a significantly higher valuation: Item 0 and Item 4.

Remaining items (Item 1 and Item 2) can be distributed to balance the total valuation or based on remaining preferences:
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 has a slightly lower total valuation after the first step).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 3, 5
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 2, 4

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
