Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  37  21  58  57  97
1  10  60  63  67  85  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, given that all items must be allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, we have two agents and six items.

We'll use a simple greedy approach to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they receive all the items.
2. Start allocating items one by one to the agent who values the item the most until each agent has 3 items (since there are 6 items total and 2 agents, each should get 3 items).

Here is how the allocation can be done:

### Step-by-step Allocation

1. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 values it at 81. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 values it at 85. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 67. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 values it at 10. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 values it at 60. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
6. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 values it at 63. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

After this allocation, Agent 0 has items [5, 0], and Agent 1 has items [4, 3, 1, 2]. However, this isn't balanced, as it doesn't give each agent an integer number of items evenly. Instead, let's ensure that both agents are allocated 3 items each.

### Balanced Allocation
- Agent 0: [5, 0, 1]
- Agent 1: [4, 3, 2]

This allocation ensures both agents have 3 items each.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0, 1],
    "1": [4, 3, 2]
}
```
