Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  98  39  45  60   5
1  50  76  40  37  82  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [50 76 40 37 82 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to distribute the total value of items as evenly as possible. Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and attempt to balance the allocations accordingly.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations
- **Agent 0**: 17 + 98 + 39 + 45 + 60 + 5 = 264
- **Agent 1**: 50 + 76 + 40 + 37 + 82 + 61 = 346

### Step 2: Evaluate Item Priority
To balance the allocation, we want each agent to receive items that contribute to a similar total valuation. Let's prioritize the items based on the relative value to each agent.

### Step 3: Allocate Items
1. Allocate items to agents one by one, aiming to balance the total valuation:
   - Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 0 (98).
   - Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 1 (82).
2. Allocate the remaining items to balance the total value.

Let's allocate the items based on a strategy that balances the total value:

- **Agent 0** gets items [1, 3, 5]:
  - Value = 98 + 45 + 5 = 148

- **Agent 1** gets items [0, 2, 4]:
  - Value = 50 + 40 + 82 = 172

### Final Check
- **Agent 0 Total Value**: 148
- **Agent 1 Total Value**: 172

This allocation is reasonably fair given the discrete nature of items and attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives.

### Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

These allocations aim to create a balance between the total values each agent assigns to the items they receive.
