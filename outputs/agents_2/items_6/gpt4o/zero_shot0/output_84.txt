Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  62  30  67  10  49
1  12  87  52  84   8  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 87 52 84  8 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items between agents while keeping each agent's valuation in mind, we can use a method that tries to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

### Valuations Table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 89     | 62     | 30     | 67     | 10     | 49     |
| 1     | 12     | 87     | 52     | 84     | 8      | 27     |

### Total Valuations for Each Agent:

- Agent 0: 89 + 62 + 30 + 67 + 10 + 49 = 307
- Agent 1: 12 + 87 + 52 + 84 + 8 + 27 = 270

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has a higher total valuation, so we can start by giving them the items they value the highest. However, we must consider Agent 1's values to ensure fairness.
2. **Agent 1** should receive some of the items with their highest valuations.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value for Agent 0 (89). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value for Agent 1 (87). Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 3**: High value for both agents but higher for Agent 1 (84). Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 2**: Moderate value for Agent 1 (52), higher than for Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Low value for both, but slightly higher for Agent 0 (10). Allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Moderate value for both, higher for Agent 0 (49). Allocate to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:

After balancing each agent's values, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the total values each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
