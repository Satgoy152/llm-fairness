Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3   3  16  51  72  83
1  70  90   4  26  76  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. This problem is similar to a combinatorial optimization problem, which can be approached with methods like the Knapsack problem or a greedy algorithm.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent would receive if they were assigned specific items:

### Agent 0:
- Valuations: [3, 3, 16, 51, 72, 83]

### Agent 1:
- Valuations: [70, 90, 4, 26, 76, 54]

We want to allocate the items such that the total value is maximized for each agent, but each agent should receive an integer number of items. A simple way is to use a greedy approach, selecting the highest value items for each agent iteratively:

1. **Calculate Total Values**:  
   - Agent 0: 3 + 3 + 16 + 51 + 72 + 83 = 228  
   - Agent 1: 70 + 90 + 4 + 26 + 76 + 54 = 320

2. **Assign Items Based on Valuation**:
   - Sort items based on the difference in valuation between agents. 
   - Assign items to the agent with the higher value for that specific item until the items are exhausted.

#### Allocation:
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 (83 vs 54)
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 (72 vs 76)
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 (51 vs 26)
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 (16 vs 4)
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 (3 vs 90)
- **Item 0**: Agent 1 (3 vs 70)

After allocation based on values, the items distributed are:

- **Agent 0**: [2, 3, 5]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 1, 4]

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total value based on their preferences.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
