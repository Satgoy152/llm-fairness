Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  53  90  28  42   4
1  12  52   6  30  79  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [12 52  6 30 79 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 2: Valuation is 90 (highest for agent 0)
   - Item 0: Valuation is 73 (next highest for agent 0)
   - Item 1: Valuation is 53 (next highest for agent 0)
   
   Agent 0 is allocated items [2, 0, 1].

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 4: Valuation is 79 (highest for agent 1)
   - Item 3: Valuation is 30 (next highest for agent 1)
   - Item 5: Valuation is 30 (next highest for agent 1)

   Agent 1 is allocated items [4, 3, 5].

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on the agents' valuations, with each agent getting an integer number of items.
