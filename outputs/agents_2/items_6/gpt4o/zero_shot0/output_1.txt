Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  41  19  37  20  11
1  45  44  71  22  55  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring that the allocation is as fair as possible. Here is one possible solution:

1. Calculate the total value of items for each agent.
2. Allocate items to each agent by maximizing the total value for each agent.

Let's evaluate the given valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 84
- Item 1: 41
- Item 2: 19
- Item 3: 37
- Item 4: 20
- Item 5: 11

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 45
- Item 1: 44
- Item 2: 71
- Item 3: 22
- Item 4: 55
- Item 5: 94

Next, we will allocate the items to each agent:

1. Sort the items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents.
2. Assign items based on which agent values them more, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Item 5 has a higher valuation for agent 1 (94 vs. 11).
- Item 0 has a higher valuation for agent 0 (84 vs. 45).
- Item 2 has a higher valuation for agent 1 (71 vs. 19).
- Item 4 has a higher valuation for agent 1 (55 vs. 20).
- Item 1 has a higher valuation for agent 0 (41 vs. 44).
- Item 3 has a higher valuation for agent 0 (37 vs. 22).

By allocating according to higher valuations and balancing the total number of items, we get:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 1, 3]
- Agent 1 gets items: [2, 4, 5]

Finally, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5]
}
```
