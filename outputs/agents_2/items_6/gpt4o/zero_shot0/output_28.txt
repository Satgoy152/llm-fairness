Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  40  18   5  91  50
1  20  27  74  98  40  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives. A common approach is to evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items and attempt to distribute items in a way that balances these totals. Let's proceed with this method:

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: [99, 40, 18, 5, 91, 50]
- Agent 1: [20, 27, 74, 98, 40, 32]

### Total Valuation:
- Total value for Agent 0: 99 + 40 + 18 + 5 + 91 + 50 = 303
- Total value for Agent 1: 20 + 27 + 74 + 98 + 40 + 32 = 291

### Allocation Strategy:
To balance the perceived value between the two agents, we can try to give items to the agent who values them more, while keeping the total perceived value as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Process:
1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it more (99 vs. 20). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it more (40 vs. 27). Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it more (18 vs. 74). Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it more (5 vs. 98). Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it more (91 vs. 40). Allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it more (50 vs. 32). Allocate to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 1, 4, 5]
- Agent 1 gets items: [2, 3]

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total perceived value of 280 and Agent 1 a total perceived value of 172. This was achieved by giving each item to the agent who values it more, where possible, while ensuring both agents get an integer number of items.
