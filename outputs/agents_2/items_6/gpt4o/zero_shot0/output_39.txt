Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  12  60  58  74  62
1  64  69  49  95  87  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 69 49 95 87 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given there are 6 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [69, 12, 60, 58, 74, 62]
- Agent 1 values: [64, 69, 49, 95, 87, 90]

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate items fairly:

1. Identify the items that each agent values the most:
   - Agent 0's highest values: 74 (item 4), 69 (item 0), 62 (item 5)
   - Agent 1's highest values: 95 (item 3), 90 (item 5), 87 (item 4)

2. Allocate items based on highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets 3 items:

   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0)
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (remaining item for Agent 1)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items and maximizes their total valuations based on the available items.

Final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
