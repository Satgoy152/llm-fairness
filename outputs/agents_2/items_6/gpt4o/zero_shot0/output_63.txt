Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  56  45  52  61  69
1  83  72  95  12  79  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6 56 45 52 61 69]
 [83 72 95 12 79 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation is as fair as possible, taking into account the agents' valuations of each item.

Given the valuations:

Agent 0: [6, 56, 45, 52, 61, 69]  
Agent 1: [83, 72, 95, 12, 79, 44]

We can approach this by maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Adjust the allocations to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Allocation Steps:

- For item 0, agent 1 values it at 83 compared to agent 0's 6. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
- For item 1, agent 1 values it at 72 compared to agent 0's 56. Assign item 1 to agent 1.
- For item 2, agent 1 values it at 95 compared to agent 0's 45. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
- For item 3, agent 0 values it at 52 compared to agent 1's 12. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
- For item 4, agent 0 values it at 61 compared to agent 1's 79. Assign item 4 to agent 1.
- For item 5, agent 0 values it at 69 compared to agent 1's 44. Assign item 5 to agent 0.

### Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: [3, 5]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 4]

Agent 0 has 2 items, and agent 1 has 4 items, which is an integer number of items for each agent. This allocation both maximizes the value each agent receives from their items and ensures a fair distribution.

### Final JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```
