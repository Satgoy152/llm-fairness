Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  72  28  63  36  16
1  25  54  13   9  52  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: First, calculate the total value each agent gives to all items.

2. **Assign Items Based on Valuation**: Start by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that both agents end up with three items since there are six items in total.

Let's compute this step by step:

**Valuations:**

- Agent 0:
  - Total value = 66 (Item 0) + 72 (Item 1) + 28 (Item 2) + 63 (Item 3) + 36 (Item 4) + 16 (Item 5) = 281

- Agent 1:
  - Total value = 25 (Item 0) + 54 (Item 1) + 13 (Item 2) + 9 (Item 3) + 52 (Item 4) + 11 (Item 5) = 164

**Item Assignments Based on Highest Valuation per Item:**

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 66, and Agent 1 values it at 25. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 72, and Agent 1 values it at 54. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 28, and Agent 1 values it at 13. Assign to Agent 0.
  
At this point, Agent 0 has three items, so the rest should go to Agent 1:

- Item 3: Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Assign to Agent 1.

**Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive exactly three items, and the allocation is based on each agent's valuation of the items.
