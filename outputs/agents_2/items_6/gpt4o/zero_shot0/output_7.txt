Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  19  42   7  90  49
1  93  75  88  32  83  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation while also considering fairness. The goal is to balance these valuations as much as possible.

First, let's list the valuations each agent has for every item:

- Agent 0 valuations: [25, 19, 42, 7, 90, 49]
- Agent 1 valuations: [93, 75, 88, 32, 83, 57]

One simple approach to try for fairness is to allocate items by maximizing each agent's total valuation, while ensuring each agent gets 3 items (since there are 6 items and 2 agents).

Let's calculate the allocations:

1. Start by sorting the valuations for each agent in descending order to see which items are most valuable to each agent.

2. Allocate items to each agent starting with their highest-valued items, ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items.

For Agent 0, the highest valuations are:
- Item 4: 90
- Item 2: 42
- Item 5: 49

For Agent 1, the highest valuations are:
- Item 0: 93
- Item 2: 88
- Item 1: 75

However, since both agents value item 2 highly, we will need to resolve this conflict by checking the next best allocations.

Let's allocate items:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 4, 5, and 0 (values are 90, 49, and 25). Total = 164.
- Agent 1: Allocate items 2, 1, and 3 (values are 88, 75, and 32). Total = 195.

This allocation balances the total value each agent receives, while distributing the items fairly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 0],
    "1": [2, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive an equitable distribution of items based on their respective valuations.
