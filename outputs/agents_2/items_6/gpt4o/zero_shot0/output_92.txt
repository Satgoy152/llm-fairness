Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  56  51  79  26  71
1  32  67  76   1  52   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [32 67 76  1 52  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents based on their valuations, one approach is to use a method that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  56  51  79  26  71
1  32  67  76   1  52   2
```

Let's analyze the optimal allocation by considering the highest-valued items for each agent:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 79
   - Item 3: 79
   - Item 5: 71

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 2: 76
   - Item 1: 67
   - Item 4: 52

Given the valuations, prioritize allocating the highest-valued items to each agent while ensuring fairness:

- **Agent 0** should receive items that maximize their total value. They highly value items 0, 3, and 5.
- **Agent 1** should receive items 2, 1, and 4 for maximizing their total value.

To ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and for simplicity:

- Assign items 0, 3, and 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 2, and 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives both agents three items each and maximizes their respective total valuations.

Now, present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
