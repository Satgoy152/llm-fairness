Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  10  95  51  10  92  24
1  59  78  38  25  47  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [59 78 38 25 47 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that both agents are satisfied with their allocation while receiving an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [10, 95, 51, 10, 92, 24]
Agent 1: [59, 78, 38, 25, 47, 36]
```

Let's try a simple heuristic approach to allocate the items. We'll assign each item to the agent who values it the most. If there is a tie, we can decide based on the overall balance of items allocated.

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (59 vs. 10).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (95 vs. 78).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (51 vs. 38).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (25 vs. 10).
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (92 vs. 47).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (36 vs. 24).

So, the allocations will be:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 5

Let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
