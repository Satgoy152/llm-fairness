Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99   0  55  61  92  80
1  83  86  89  74  73  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- **Agent 0's valuations:** 99, 0, 55, 61, 92, 80
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: \(99 + 0 + 55 + 61 + 92 + 80 = 387\)

- **Agent 1's valuations:** 83, 86, 89, 74, 73, 93
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: \(83 + 86 + 89 + 74 + 73 + 93 = 498\)

Now, let's try to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is approximately balanced.

By examining the valuations, we can make the following allocations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items 0, 3, 4
  - Valuations: 99, 61, 92
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: \(99 + 61 + 92 = 252\)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items 1, 2, 5
  - Valuations: 86, 89, 93
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: \(86 + 89 + 93 = 268\)

This allocation gives us a balanced distribution of the total valuations, with Agent 0 receiving a total valuation of 252 and Agent 1 receiving a total valuation of 268.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
