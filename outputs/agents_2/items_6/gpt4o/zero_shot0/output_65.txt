Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  10  93  52  98  73  87
1  78  33  60  26  42  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 33 60 26 42 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. Let's analyze the values and make an allocation.

First, we list the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 1: 93
  - Item 2: 52
  - Item 3: 98
  - Item 4: 73
  - Item 5: 87

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 33
  - Item 2: 60
  - Item 3: 26
  - Item 4: 42
  - Item 5: 22

Now, we will attempt to allocate the items so that the total value for each agent is as fair as possible. This can involve some balancing, as one agent might value an item much higher than the other agent.

A possible allocation strategy is:

1. Evaluate the highest valued items for each agent and allocate accordingly.
2. Balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 1 (value 93)
  - Item 3 (value 98)
  - Item 5 (value 87)

Total for Agent 0 = 93 + 98 + 87 = 278

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0 (value 78)
  - Item 2 (value 60)
  - Item 4 (value 42)

Total for Agent 1 = 78 + 60 + 42 = 180

This allocation ensures that Agent 0, who values items more highly, receives the items they value most, while Agent 1 receives items that offer them the most value based on their valuations.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
