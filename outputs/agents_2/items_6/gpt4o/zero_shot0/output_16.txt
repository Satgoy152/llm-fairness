Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  18  64  81  64   3
1  98  78  76  12  17  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [98 78 76 12 17 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we need to consider the value each agent places on the items and try to maximize the total value for both agents. One common method is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: 1, 18, 64, 81, 64, 3
Agent 1: 98, 78, 76, 12, 17, 77
```

To allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 98 while Agent 0 values it at 1. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 78 while Agent 0 values it at 18. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 76 while Agent 0 values it at 64. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 81 while Agent 1 values it at 12. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 64 while Agent 1 values it at 17. Allocate to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 77 while Agent 0 values it at 3. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now let's ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0 has items [3, 4] (2 items).
- Agent 1 has items [0, 1, 2, 5] (4 items).

This allocation is integer-based and fairly reflects the highest valuations for each item. 

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5]
}
```
