Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1  2   3   4   5
0   1  22  6  69   3  97
1  98   7  7  45  10  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll use the valuations provided to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the most (97), so we assign item 5 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (98), so we assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. Next, for agent 0, item 3 has the second-highest value (69), so we assign item 3 to agent 0.
4. For agent 1, item 3 was already assigned, so we choose the next highest available, item 5, already assigned. We choose item 1, value (7).
5. Agent 0 would now prefer item 1 (22), but it's already assigned. We assign item 2 (6) to agent 0.
6. Lastly, agent 1 receives the remaining items, items 4 and 2.

Based on this process, here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3, 2],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents have an integer number of items and considers their preferences.
