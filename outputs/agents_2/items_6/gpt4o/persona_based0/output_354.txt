Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  36  55  58  36  78
1  70  51  18  44  52  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, I'll use a simple approach that considers each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's the breakdown of the values each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0 values: [37, 36, 55, 58, 36, 78]
- Agent 1 values: [70, 51, 18, 44, 52, 46]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a strategy where each agent gets their highest-valued items that are still available, but we must ensure that the total number of items allocated to each agent is balanced.

1. Rank each agent's items by value:
   - Agent 0: [5, 3, 2, 0, 1, 4] (from highest to lowest value)
   - Agent 1: [0, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2] (from highest to lowest value)

2. Assign items to agents by alternating picks based on their rankings, ensuring a balanced distribution.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [5, 2, 1]
- Agent 1 receives items: [0, 3, 4]

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 a total value of: 78 + 55 + 36 = 169
- Agent 1 a total value of: 70 + 44 + 52 = 166

Both agents receive three items, and the total values are relatively balanced. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2, 1],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
