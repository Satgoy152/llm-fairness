Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  28  85  13  58   8
1  93  87  41  24  77  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to consider the valuations of each item by the agents and attempt to allocate items in a way that each agent perceives their allocation as fair or at least not significantly worse than the other agent's allocation.

First, let's tabulate the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [60, 28, 85, 13, 58, 8]
- Agent 1's valuations: [93, 87, 41, 24, 77, 77]

The goal is to distribute the 6 items between the 2 agents. Let's aim to maximize the perceived value for each agent while minimizing envy. This can be approached by considering who values each item more:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 60; Agent 1 values it at 93. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 28; Agent 1 values it at 87. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 85; Agent 1 values it at 41. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 13; Agent 1 values it at 24. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 58; Agent 1 values it at 77. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 8; Agent 1 values it at 77. Allocate to Agent 1.

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [2]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 3, 4, 5]

This allocation does not distribute the items evenly. Let's try another approach to ensure both agents receive items:

Let's allocate items in a way that distributes them more evenly:

- Item 0: Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value for Agent 1).
- Item 1: Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value for Agent 1).
- Item 2: Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value for Agent 0).
- Item 3: Allocate to Agent 0 (remaining item and lower value for both).
- Item 4: Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value for Agent 1).
- Item 5: Allocate to Agent 0 (remaining item).

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives three items. Given the values, this allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value each agent receives, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
