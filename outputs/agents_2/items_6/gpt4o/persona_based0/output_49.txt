Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40  48  48  84  13  98
1   0  94  49  55  92  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that ensures envy-freeness, we need to allocate items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. A common approach is to minimize envy, where each agent values their own bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle.

Here's a step-by-step procedure to achieve this:

1. **List the values for each agent:**

   - Agent 0: [40, 48, 48, 84, 13, 98]
   - Agent 1: [0, 94, 49, 55, 92, 16]

2. **Evaluate the highest value items for each agent:**

   - Agent 0's highest value items are 5 (98) and 3 (84).
   - Agent 1's highest value items are 1 (94) and 4 (92).

3. **Assign items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:** 

   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it's their second-highest valued item.

   Remaining items for Agent 0: [40, 48, 48, 13]

   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it's their next highest valued item.

   Remaining items for Agent 1: [0, 49, 55, 16]

4. **Allocate the remaining items:**

   - Agent 0 will take item 2, valued at 48.
   - Agent 1 will take item 0, valued at 0, since Agent 0 has already received their higher-valued items.

5. **Final allocation:**

   - Agent 0: [2, 3, 5]
   - Agent 1: [0, 1, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they highly value, and the remaining items are distributed in a way that minimizes envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
