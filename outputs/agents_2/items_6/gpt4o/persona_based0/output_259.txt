Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  51  64  68  30  97
1  55  52  54  75  21  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their perceived value while maintaining fairness. A common approach to achieving an envy-free allocation is to use the "divide and choose" method or to balance the total value of items allocated to each agent.

Here, I'll calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and aim to allocate items such that the total value perceived by each agent is as close as possible.

Firstly, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 30 + 51 + 64 + 68 + 30 + 97 = 340
- Agent 1: 55 + 52 + 54 + 75 + 21 + 64 = 321

Now, we should allocate the items in a way that balances the total value for each agent, trying to achieve an allocation where neither agent envies the other.

One possible allocation is as follows:

1. Calculate marginal values and prioritize items for each agent:

   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (97), so they should receive it.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (75), so they should receive it.

2. Allocate the next highest valued items until all items are distributed, ensuring the total value difference between agents is minimized.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 receives items 5, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 3, 0, and 4.

Now, let's confirm the allocation:

- Agent 0's total value: 97 (item 5) + 51 (item 1) + 64 (item 2) = 212
- Agent 1's total value: 75 (item 3) + 55 (item 0) + 21 (item 4) = 151

This allocation balances the total value each agent receives as closely as possible, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 0, 4]
}
```
