Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4  5
0  91  86  68  76  48  3
1  15  97  30  82  77  5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly and ensure envy-freeness, we must consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. Below are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [91, 86, 68, 76, 48, 3]
- Agent 1: [15, 97, 30, 82, 77, 5]

A fair division should aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair given their valuations. 

One approach is to use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that no agent envies another. This is not always perfectly possible, but we can often get close with small numbers of items and agents.

Let's analyze the valuations and make a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 0 (91) and item 1 (86).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 (97) and item 4 (77).

To ensure a fair allocation, we can proceed by attempting to give each agent the item(s) they value most, while balancing the total value each receives.

Based on the valuations:

1. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1** because it is the highest value item for them.
2. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0** because it is the highest value for them, excluding item 1 which is already allocated.
3. After these allocations, we need to allocate the remaining items: 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Let's check the remaining items:

- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 at 30.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 82.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 48, Agent 1 at 77.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 3, Agent 1 at 5.

Continuing the allocation:

4. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1** because they value it more than Agent 0.
5. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0** because they value it more than Agent 1.
6. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 1** because they value it more than Agent 0.
7. Finally, **allocate item 5 to Agent 1** because they value it slightly more than Agent 0.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0 and 2
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 4, 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and we attempt to minimize envy within these constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
