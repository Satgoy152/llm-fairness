Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  27   7  51  36  99
1  98  27  21  32  87  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use concepts from fair division and envy-freeness. The aim is to allocate items such that no agent envies the other, given their valuations. 

The valuations matrix is:

```
         Agents
Items    0   1
    0   66  98
    1   27  27
    2    7  21
    3   51  32
    4   36  87
    5   99  84
```

Let's approach the allocation using a simple method aiming for envy-freeness by considering each agent's highest valued items and distribute them accordingly while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

1. **Agent 0**'s highest valued items in descending order are: 
   - Item 5 (99)
   - Item 0 (66)
   - Item 3 (51)
   - Item 4 (36)
   - Item 1 (27)
   - Item 2 (7)

2. **Agent 1**'s highest valued items in descending order are:
   - Item 0 (98)
   - Item 4 (87)
   - Item 5 (84)
   - Item 3 (32)
   - Item 2 (21)
   - Item 1 (27)

**Allocation Strategy:**

- Start by assigning the highest valued item of each agent to each agent alternately, checking for potential envy and adjusting if necessary.

After considering the above, we can allocate items as follows:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 because it is valued highest by Agent 1 (98) compared to Agent 0 (66).
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 because it is valued highest by Agent 0 (99) compared to Agent 1 (84).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 because it is valued higher by Agent 1 (87) compared to Agent 0 (36).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 because it is valued higher by Agent 0 (51) compared to Agent 1 (32).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 because both agents value it equally, but Agent 1 has already received two high-value items.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 due to remaining balance and fairness, as it provides Agent 1 with an additional item.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy and ensure fairness by balancing the number of items and considering each agent's preferences.
