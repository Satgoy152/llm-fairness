Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  89  62  17  36  13
1  36  76  16  98  91  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair or satisfactory. Here is one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0** has higher valuations on items 0, 1, and 2, compared to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 1** has higher valuations on items 3, 4, and 5, compared to Agent 0.

Based on this, a potential envy-free allocation could be:

- Assign items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 3, 4, and 5 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value highly relative to the other agent's valuation, thereby minimizing envy.

Here is the final allocation presented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
