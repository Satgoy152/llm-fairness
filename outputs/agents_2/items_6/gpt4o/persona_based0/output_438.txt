Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  30  73  94  36  23
1  91   6  54  84  88  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should not prefer the allocation of items given to the other agent over their own. 

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items and aim to balance the allocations around these total valuations:

For Agent 0:
- Item 0: 83
- Item 1: 30
- Item 2: 73
- Item 3: 94
- Item 4: 36
- Item 5: 23  
Total: 339

For Agent 1:
- Item 0: 91
- Item 1: 6
- Item 2: 54
- Item 3: 84
- Item 4: 88
- Item 5: 19  
Total: 342

Next, we look for an allocation that balances each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, minimizing any potential envy. One approach is to assign items so that the total valuation for each agent's allocated items is as close as possible.

A possible fair allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 5
  - Total Valuation: 83 + 73 + 23 = 179
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 4
  - Total Valuation: 6 + 84 + 88 = 178

In this allocation, each agent receives a set of items such that the total valuation is fairly balanced, and each agent does not strictly prefer the other's allocation over their own.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
