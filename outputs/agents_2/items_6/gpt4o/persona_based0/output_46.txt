Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  30  87  12  53  98
1  44  30  64  26  59   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items in such a way that they feel they have received a fair share according to their valuations. A common approach to achieve fairness is to aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, meaning that each agent should feel at least as satisfied with their own allocation as they would with the other agent's allocation.

Let's consider the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 52
- Item 1: 30
- Item 2: 87
- Item 3: 12
- Item 4: 53
- Item 5: 98

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 44
- Item 1: 30
- Item 2: 64
- Item 3: 26
- Item 4: 59
- Item 5: 5

The total value each agent perceives for all items is:
- Agent 0: 52 + 30 + 87 + 12 + 53 + 98 = 332
- Agent 1: 44 + 30 + 64 + 26 + 59 + 5 = 228

Given these valuations, we aim to allocate items to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **High-value items:** Both agents highly value item 5 (Agent 0 values it at 98, and Agent 1 at 5), but Agent 0 values it much more. Let's assign item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Balancing remaining high-value items:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 highly at 87, while Agent 1 values it at 64. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 59, while Agent 0 values it at 53. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Assign remaining items:**
   - Items 0, 1, and 3 are left. 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 52 and item 1 at 30, while Agent 1 values item 0 at 44 and item 1 at 30; let's balance by giving item 0 to Agent 1 and items 1 and 3 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, 3, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 4.

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0 a perceived value of: 30 (item 1) + 87 (item 2) + 12 (item 3) + 98 (item 5) = 227
- Agent 1 a perceived value of: 44 (item 0) + 59 (item 4) = 103

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
