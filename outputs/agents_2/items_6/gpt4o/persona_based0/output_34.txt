Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  30  13  72  22  13
1  30  31   6  57  32  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [30 31  6 57 32 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable to them as the allocation of the other agent.

Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 44 + 30 + 13 + 72 + 22 + 13 = 194
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 30 + 31 + 6 + 57 + 32 + 36 = 192

2. **Assign Items by Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most: 72
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most: 36

3. **Continue Assigning Remaining Items:**
   - After assigning item 3 to Agent 0, we look for the next highest value items for Agent 0 which are item 0 (44) and item 1 (30).
   - After assigning item 5 to Agent 1, we look for the next highest value items for Agent 1 which are item 4 (32) and item 1 (31).
  
4. **Check for Overlaps and Resolve by Value:**
   - Both agents want item 1, but Agent 0 values it slightly less. Therefore, we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - This leaves Agent 0 with items 0 and 2 (his next highest valued items after item 3).

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items: 0, 2, and 3
   - Agent 1 gets items: 1, 4, and 5

This allocation ensures each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their happiness based on their valuations, while also ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
