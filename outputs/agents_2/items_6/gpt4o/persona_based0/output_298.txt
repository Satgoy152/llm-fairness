Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  76  28  12  87  24
1  67  35  38  58  12  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an envy-free allocation. An allocation is envy-free if each agent believes they have received at least as much value as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuation.

Here are the steps to achieve an envy-free allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 85 + 76 + 28 + 12 + 87 + 24 = 312
   - Agent 1: 67 + 35 + 38 + 58 + 12 + 42 = 252

2. **Sort Items by Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's sorted values: (4:87), (0:85), (1:76), (2:28), (5:24), (3:12)
   - Agent 1's sorted values: (3:58), (0:67), (5:42), (2:38), (1:35), (4:12)

3. **Allocate Items to Maximize Each Agent's Value:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest, so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest, so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Compare the next highest available items for each agent and allocate to the agent who values it more if possible.

4. **Continue Allocating Until All Items Are Assigned:**
   - Agent 0: Items 4, 0 (values 87, 85)
   - Agent 1: Items 3, 5 (values 58, 42)

5. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are 1 and 2.
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (value 76, which is higher than Agent 1's value for item 1)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (value 38, higher for Agent 1 than Agent 0 values item 2)

Now, each agent has 3 items, and the allocation is as balanced as possible.

Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5, 2]
}
```
