Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  99  52  45  71  76
1  32  46  56  34   4  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while focusing on envy-freeness, it is important to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to provide them with a collection of items that maximizes their satisfaction relative to the other agent.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:  
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 1: 99
  - Item 2: 52
  - Item 3: 45
  - Item 4: 71
  - Item 5: 76

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 56
  - Item 3: 34
  - Item 4: 4
  - Item 5: 17

A possible approach is to allocate the items based on maximizing the sum of each agent's valuations for the items they receive, while ensuring that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 1, so they should receive these to maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest, so they should receive that item.
3. Consider remaining items based on maximizing the remaining value for each agent and balancing the total number of items allocated.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0** receives items [0, 1, 5] (valuations: 97, 99, 76).
- **Agent 1** receives items [2, 3, 4] (valuations: 56, 34, 4).

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations each agent receives and minimize potential envy.

### Valuations for Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: 97 + 99 + 76 = 272
- **Agent 1**: 56 + 34 + 4 = 94

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
