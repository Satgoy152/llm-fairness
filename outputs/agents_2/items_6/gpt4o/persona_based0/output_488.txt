Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  49  74  83  51   7
1  49  95  60  62  30  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent's valuation of their own bundle is as close as possible to their valuations of other bundles.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 18 + 49 + 74 + 83 + 51 + 7 = 282
- Agent 1's total valuation: 49 + 95 + 60 + 62 + 30 + 38 = 334

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items to minimize envy:

1. **Allocate Items to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (83).
   - Next highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 2 (74).
   - Allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Allocate Items to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (95).
   - Next highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 2 (60), but item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we move to the next: item 3 (62).
   - Allocate item 1 and item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Complete the Allocation:**
   - Allocate remaining items (0, 4, 5) to each agent to balance out the total value they receive.

Now, let's check the total value received by each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (74) + Item 3 (83) = 157
- Agent 1: Item 1 (95) + Item 0 (49) + Item 4 (30) + Item 5 (38) = 212

This distribution minimizes the difference in total value between the agents, though further attempts might be needed to balance within the constraints.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items in a manner that respects their valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
