Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71   7  42  58  72  36
1  54  54  49  56  13  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents based on their valuations, we aim to ensure that neither agent envies the allocation of the other. This involves evaluating the total value each agent receives from their allocated items and ensuring a balanced distribution.

Here are the valuations of each item by both agents:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 71
  - Item 1: 7
  - Item 2: 42
  - Item 3: 58
  - Item 4: 72
  - Item 5: 36

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 54
  - Item 1: 54
  - Item 2: 49
  - Item 3: 56
  - Item 4: 13
  - Item 5: 65

A common approach to achieve a fair division is the "envy-free" allocation, where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. We will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while balancing the total value they receive.

Let's consider two criteria for allocation:
1. Each agent should receive a similar total value as per their valuations.
2. Each agent should end up with 3 items, as there are 6 items in total.

Based on these criteria, we can allocate as follows:

- Assign Item 0 (value 71) to Agent 0, as it is highly valued by Agent 0.
- Assign Item 4 (value 72) to Agent 0, as it is the highest valued by Agent 0.
- Assign Item 5 (value 36) to Agent 0, as it provides a balanced total value.

- Assign Item 1 (value 54) to Agent 1, as it is equally valued by both agents, but it helps balance Agent 1's total value.
- Assign Item 2 (value 49) to Agent 1, as it is highly valued by Agent 1.
- Assign Item 3 (value 56) to Agent 1, as it is highly valued by Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair value based on their own valuations.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation provides a balanced distribution where both agents end up with 3 items each, and the total value received by each agent is as fair as possible according to their individual valuations.
