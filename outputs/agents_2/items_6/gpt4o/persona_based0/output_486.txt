Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  54  40  84   1  22
1  88  34  90  33  35  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate the items so that no agent feels that another agent received a better set of items according to their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [52, 54, 40, 84, 1, 22]
- Agent 1 values: [88, 34, 90, 33, 35, 58]

Let's try to allocate the items in a way that balances these valuations:

1. Start by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent according to their own preferences.

2. Try to ensure that each agent's total valuation of their allocation is as close as possible, reducing possible envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (84), item 1 (54), and item 0 (52).
- **Agent 1** highly values item 2 (90), item 0 (88), and item 5 (58).

Given this, we can attempt the following allocation:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, who values it at 84.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, who values it at 90.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, who values it at 88.

Now, consider the remaining items and their values:

- Items left: 1, 4, 5

Distribute these remaining items to balance the total valuation:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, who values it at 54.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1, who values it at 58.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, who values it at 1.

Now, let's list the allocations and ensure all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 3, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 2, 5

Calculating total valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 54 (item 1) + 84 (item 3) + 1 (item 4) = 139
- Agent 1's total valuation: 88 (item 0) + 90 (item 2) + 58 (item 5) = 236

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free given the disparity in total valuation, but it aligns with each agent's highest preferences. Since only integers are possible, the allocation attempts to respect each agent's high-valued preferences as much as possible.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
