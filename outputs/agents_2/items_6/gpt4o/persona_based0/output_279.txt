Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57   5  16  43  87  22
1  24  89  61  50  66  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [24 89 61 50 66 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent envies the other, as much as possible given the constraints.

We have the following valuation matrix:

```
        0   1   2   3   4   5
Agent 0: 57   5  16  43  87  22
Agent 1: 24  89  61  50  66  73
```

A common approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion or the "Maximin Share" guarantee. In this specific problem, we will try to balance the total valuations for each agent.

Let's calculate the total value each agent gives to all the items:

- Agent 0: 57 + 5 + 16 + 43 + 87 + 22 = 230
- Agent 1: 24 + 89 + 61 + 50 + 66 + 73 = 363

Now, let's try to allocate items such that both agents get a fair share of the total value:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 4 (87) and item 0 (57).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (89) and item 5 (73).

A possible allocation that balances the value could be:

- Assign item 4 and item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 and item 5 to Agent 1.

Next, we allocate the remaining items (2 and 3) to further balance the values:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 4] with values: 57 + 43 + 87 = 187
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 5] with values: 89 + 61 + 73 = 223

This allocation doesn't make either agent completely envy-free, but it provides a relatively balanced distribution of total valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
