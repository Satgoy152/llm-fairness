Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  33  26  33  40  73
1   2   5  21  38  87  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 2  5 21 38 87 16]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where neither agent prefers the bundle of the other agent over their own. Given the valuations, we'll consider the potential allocations that maximize each agent's perceived value while ensuring a fair distribution of items.

### Valuations Matrix
```
           Items
     0    1    2    3    4    5
A0  67   33   26   33   40   73
A1   2    5   21   38   87   16
```

### Strategy
1. **Agent 0**: Values items 0 and 5 the highest.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the highest, followed by item 3.

### Allocation Process
1. **Assign Item 5** to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. **Assign Item 4** to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. **Assign Item 0** to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).
4. **Assign Item 3** to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1).
5. **Assign Item 2** to Agent 1 (agent 1 values it more than agent 0).
6. **Assign Item 1** to Agent 0 (remaining item, and agent 0 values it more than agent 1).

### Final Allocation
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 4

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value highly and minimizes envy between the agents.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
