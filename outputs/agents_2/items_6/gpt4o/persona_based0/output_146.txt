Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  58  64  54  56  97
1  45  72   7  32  85   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 72  7 32 85  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent in such a way that is as envy-free as possible. 

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: [21, 58, 64, 54, 56, 97]
- Agent 1's valuations: [45, 72, 7, 32, 85, 8]

We can start by assigning each item to the agent that values it the most, then check for possible envy and adjust accordingly:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (45 vs. 21), so assign to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (72 vs. 58), so assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (64 vs. 7), so assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (54 vs. 32), so assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (85 vs. 56), so assign to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (97 vs. 8), so assign to Agent 0.

This initial allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 4]

Let's verify:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 64 + 54 + 97 = 215
- Agent 1's total valuation: 45 + 72 + 85 = 202

The allocation is close in total valuation, and each agent has been assigned items they value more than the counterpart. 

Thus, the fair allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
