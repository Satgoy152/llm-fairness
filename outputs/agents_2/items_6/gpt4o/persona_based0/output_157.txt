Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98   4  96  80  48  70
1  40  12  90  15  80  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find a fair allocation of items to agents based on their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation or at least minimize envy as much as possible. Here, we have two agents and six items. The goal is to allocate all 6 items such that each agent feels they receive a fair share according to their valuations.

### Valuations Matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 98     | 4      | 96     | 80     | 48     | 70     |
| 1     | 40     | 12     | 90     | 15     | 80     | 58     |

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0 values items 0, 2, and 3 highly.
   - Agent 1 values items 2, 4, and 5 highly.

2. **Allocate items to maximize total satisfaction**:
   - Since both agents value item 2 highly, we need to balance this allocation carefully.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 as it is highly valued by them, and Agent 1 does not value it as much.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it is their highest value item.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 as the next highly valued item.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 because it is highly valued by them and less so by Agent 0.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 to balance their allocation.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0, which Agent 1 values less.

### Final Allocation:

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize the value each agent receives, taking into consideration their preferences, while ensuring all items are distributed.
