Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  26   3  91  43  64
1  49  94  62  60  46  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items between the two agents (0 and 1), we aim to minimize envy. A common approach for such a small problem is to use the "maximum envy-free" criterion, where we try to ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0's total value: \(81 + 26 + 3 + 91 + 43 + 64 = 308\)
- Agent 1's total value: \(49 + 94 + 62 + 60 + 46 + 53 = 364\)

Now, let's explore potential allocations:

1. **First Allocation Approach:**
   - Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 5
     - Total value for Agent 0: \(81 + 91 + 64 = 236\)
   - Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 4
     - Total value for Agent 1: \(94 + 62 + 46 = 202\)

2. **Second Allocation Approach:**
   - Agent 0 receives items: 0, 4, 5
     - Total value for Agent 0: \(81 + 43 + 64 = 188\)
   - Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 3
     - Total value for Agent 1: \(94 + 62 + 60 = 216\)

Let's evaluate these allocations to ensure fairness and minimal envy:

- **First Allocation:**
  - Agent 0 has a total value of 236 from their items.
  - Agent 1 has a total value of 202 from their items.
  - The difference in total values is 34, with Agent 0 having the higher value.

- **Second Allocation:**
  - Agent 0 has a total value of 188 from their items.
  - Agent 1 has a total value of 216 from their items.
  - The difference in total values is 28, with Agent 1 having the higher value.

The second allocation results in a smaller difference and is closer to balance in terms of total valuation. Therefore, it is more preferable under the criteria of fairness and envy minimization.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
