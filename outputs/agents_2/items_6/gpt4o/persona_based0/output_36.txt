Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  60  34  16  99  52
1  85  26  28  39  21  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels they received a fair share based on their own valuations.

To achieve this, we can use the method of maximizing the minimum satisfaction level or ensuring that each agent's assigned bundle is of roughly equal perceived value to them, considering their valuations.

Let's start by examining the total valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [12, 60, 34, 16, 99, 52] 
  - Total value for Agent 0: 12 + 60 + 34 + 16 + 99 + 52 = 273

- Agent 1 values: [85, 26, 28, 39, 21, 22]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 85 + 26 + 28 + 39 + 21 + 22 = 221

Now, let's look at the items to determine the optimal allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation based on highest value per agent:**

   - Agent 0 highly values item 4 (value 99).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0 (value 85).

2. **Allocation based on trying to balance the total perceived value:**

   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining items:**

   The remaining items are [1, 2, 3, 5].

4. **Allocate remaining items by balancing perceived values:**

   - Consider Agent 0's next highest value items: 1 (60), 5 (52)
   - Consider Agent 1's next highest value items: 3 (39), 2 (28)

5. **To balance, we can attempt:**

   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1

Now, let's verify the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives items [4, 1, 5]:
  - Values: 99 + 60 + 52 = 211

- Agent 1 receives items [0, 2, 3]:
  - Values: 85 + 28 + 39 = 152

This allocation aims to balance the allocation based on each agentâ€™s highest perceived values while ensuring all items are distributed.

Finally, the allocation can be presented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.
