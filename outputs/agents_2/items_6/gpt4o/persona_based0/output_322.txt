Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  96  95  25  97  29
1  28  77  66   0  35  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [28 77 66  0 35 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or at least minimizes envy. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is as good as or better than what they perceive they could achieve by swapping with the other agent's allocation.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 49 + 96 + 95 + 25 + 97 + 29 = 391
- Agent 1's total valuation: 28 + 77 + 66 + 0 + 35 + 37 = 243

Given these valuations, we should try to allocate items in a way that both agents feel they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

### Step-by-Step Allocation

1. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values this item the highest at 97, and Agent 1 values it at 35. Therefore, it's reasonable to allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this at 96, and Agent 1 values it at 77. Since Agent 0's valuation is higher, allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this at 95, and Agent 1 values it at 66. Again, Agent 0 has a higher valuation, so allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 49, and Agent 1 values it at 28. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 29, and Agent 1 values it at 37. This item will be allocated to Agent 1 as they have a higher valuation for it.

6. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 25, and Agent 1 values it at 0. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation

Based on these steps, we have the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 5

This allocation ensures each agent receives a share of the items, reflecting their valuations, and it minimizes the potential for envy between the agents.

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [5]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 6 items in total, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, as required.
