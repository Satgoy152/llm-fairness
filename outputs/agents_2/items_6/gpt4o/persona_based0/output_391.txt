Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  46   4  32  60  15
1   4  25  64  26  32  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim for a distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations, potentially leading to an envy-free or almost envy-free result. Each agent should receive three items since there are six items in total.

First, let's summarize the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \( 72 + 46 + 4 + 32 + 60 + 15 = 229 \)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \( 4 + 25 + 64 + 26 + 32 + 89 = 240 \)

Next, let's consider possible allocations that maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0's perspective**: Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, and 4. Allocating these items to Agent 0 would give them a total value of \( 72 + 46 + 60 = 178 \).

2. **Agent 1's perspective**: Agent 1 highly values items 2, 5, and 4. However, since item 4 is already allocated to Agent 0 due to their stronger preference, we look at their next highest preferences: items 2, 5, and 3. Allocating these to Agent 1 would give them a total value of \( 64 + 89 + 26 = 179 \).

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value highly and results in a balanced distribution in terms of their perceived values.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent three items, and both agents receive a similar total value based on their valuations, promoting fairness and minimizing envy.
