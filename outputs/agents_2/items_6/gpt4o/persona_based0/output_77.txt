Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73   2  14  51  44  41
1   9  28  80  54  22  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent values their allocation as highly as possible. We'll consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

### Agent Valuations:

- **Agent 0 Valuations:** [73, 2, 14, 51, 44, 41]
- **Agent 1 Valuations:** [9, 28, 80, 54, 22, 90]

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **High-Value Items for Each Agent:** 
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (73), while Agent 1 highly values item 5 (90).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 and item 5 to Agent 1.

2. **Second Priority Items:**
   - Agent 1's next highest value is item 2 (80), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0's next highest value is item 3 (51), allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - For agent 1, the next highest value is item 3 (54), but it's already allocated. The next highest available is item 1 (28). 
   - Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 4 (44).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 and item 1 to Agent 1.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - The last unallocated item is item 3, which has already been allocated to Agent 0, so we need to ensure the allocations are complete with 6 items distributed.

### Resulting Allocations:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 3, 4
- **Agent 1:** Items 1, 2, 5

This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
