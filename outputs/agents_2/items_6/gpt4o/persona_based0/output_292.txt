Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1  2   3   4   5
0  72  76  5  45  64  16
1  44  66  5  62  76  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve a division where both agents regard their share as fair according to their own valuations. This typically involves ensuring that neither agent perceives the other's share as more valuable than their own, which is known as envy-freeness.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 72 + 76 + 5 + 45 + 64 + 16 = 278
- Agent 1's total valuation: 44 + 66 + 5 + 62 + 76 + 65 = 318

To achieve a fair division, we can use the strategy of maximizing each agentâ€™s value while ensuring the allocation of all items. Let's analyze the values to allocate items in a way that each agent values their share close to half of their total valuation. This might not always be perfectly possible, but we aim to minimize envy.

First, let's consider allocating high-value items:

1. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 64
   - Agent 1 values it at 76 (higher)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 76
   - Agent 1 values it at 66 (lower)

3. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 45
   - Agent 1 values it at 62 (higher)

4. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 72 (higher)
   - Agent 1 values it at 44

5. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 16
   - Agent 1 values it at 65 (higher)

6. **Item 2**: 
   - Both value it at 5

A possible allocation strategy is to:

- Assign items where one agent has a significantly higher valuation.
- Balance the total value assigned to each agent according to their preferences.

Given this, a reasonable allocation could be:

- Assign Agent 0 the items [0, 1, 2]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 72 + 76 + 5 = 153

- Assign Agent 1 the items [3, 4, 5]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 62 + 76 + 65 = 203

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives a fair share of their perceived value and Agent 1 receives a higher value of their perceived value, balancing the distribution based on relative valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
