Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  74  57  65  37  97
1  54  15  35  74  57  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the six items between the two agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method that balances the total value each agent receives. Let's sum the valuations for each agent and then attempt to distribute the items such that the total value is as equitable as possible.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 45
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 57
  - Item 3: 65
  - Item 4: 37
  - Item 5: 97
  - Total: 45 + 74 + 57 + 65 + 37 + 97 = 375

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 54
  - Item 1: 15
  - Item 2: 35
  - Item 3: 74
  - Item 4: 57
  - Item 5: 97
  - Total: 54 + 15 + 35 + 74 + 57 + 97 = 332

Our goal is to allocate these items so that the total value each agent receives is as even as possible.

A potential allocation strategy is:

- Allocate items [1, 2, 5] to Agent 0.
- Allocate items [0, 3, 4] to Agent 1.

Let's calculate the total value each agent receives with this allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 57
  - Item 5: 97
  - Total for Agent 0: 74 + 57 + 97 = 228

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 54
  - Item 3: 74
  - Item 4: 57
  - Total for Agent 1: 54 + 74 + 57 = 185

This allocation balances the total values received by the agents as closely as possible given the constraints. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
