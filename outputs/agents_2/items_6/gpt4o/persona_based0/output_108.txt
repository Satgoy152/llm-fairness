Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  53  78   9  19  28
1  43  89   7  99  20  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, we can employ the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as desirable as that of any other agent. This involves considering each agent's valuation for the items and attempting to distribute them in a manner that maximizes each agent's perceived value from their allocated items.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
       0   1   2   3   4   5
Agent 0: 21  53  78   9  19  28
Agent 1: 43  89   7  99  20  90
```

Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (78), and item 1 next (53).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (99), and item 1 next (89).

Let's start by allocating the items with the highest individual valuations to each agent and then proceed to ensure all items are distributed fairly:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (highest valued by agent 1).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (highest valued by agent 0).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (second highest valued by agent 1 and highly valued by agent 0).
4. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (next highest valued item for agent 0).
5. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (highly valued by agent 1 and less valued by agent 0).
6. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (remaining item, giving a better balance and reducing envy).

By this allocation, each agent receives items such that they maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations, and the distribution is balanced.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
