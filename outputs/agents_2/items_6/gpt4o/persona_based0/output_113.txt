Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  34  89  41  92  11
1  37  71  79  35  77  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the strategy of maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring that both agents receive a comparable total value. Given the valuations, it's crucial to ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation, meaning each agent should feel that they received at least as much value as they perceive in the other's allocation.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Total Value Calculation**:
   - Agent 0's total valuation for all items: 97 + 34 + 89 + 41 + 92 + 11 = 364
   - Agent 1's total valuation for all items: 37 + 71 + 79 + 35 + 77 + 64 = 363

2. **Initial Allocation**:
   - We want to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them the items they value most while keeping the total value as balanced as possible between the two agents.

3. **Agent 0's Highest Valuations**:
   - Item 0: 97
   - Item 4: 92
   - Item 2: 89

4. **Agent 1's Highest Valuations**:
   - Item 2: 79
   - Item 1: 71
   - Item 4: 77

5. **Balanced Allocation**:
   - Allocate items to each agent to balance the total perceived value and avoid envy:
     - **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2, 5
     - **Agent 1**: Items 1, 3, 4

6. **Final Check**:
   - Agent 0's allocated value: 97 (item 0) + 89 (item 2) + 11 (item 5) = 197
   - Agent 1's allocated value: 71 (item 1) + 35 (item 3) + 77 (item 4) = 183
   - Both allocations are relatively balanced in terms of each agentâ€™s perceived value, and neither agent would envy the other's allocation based on the values.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the satisfaction of both agents while ensuring that the distribution is as fair and envy-free as possible given the constraints.
