Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4  5
0  84  70  27  54  73  4
1  60  25  87  56  79  1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that neither agent feels the other has received more value. The goal is to minimize envy, where each agent believes their allocation is at least as valuable as the allocation of the other agent.

Let's first review the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [84, 70, 27, 54, 73, 4]
- Agent 1 values: [60, 25, 87, 56, 79, 1]

Next, we will consider an allocation that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. One approach is to sum up the valuations for each item and allocate items to agents where the difference in perceived value is minimized.

Let's calculate the total value each item holds for both agents combined:

- Item 0: 84 (Agent 0) + 60 (Agent 1) = 144
- Item 1: 70 (Agent 0) + 25 (Agent 1) = 95
- Item 2: 27 (Agent 0) + 87 (Agent 1) = 114
- Item 3: 54 (Agent 0) + 56 (Agent 1) = 110
- Item 4: 73 (Agent 0) + 79 (Agent 1) = 152
- Item 5: 4 (Agent 0) + 1 (Agent 1) = 5

With these total values, we aim to allocate items such that each agent's perceived total value is as close as possible, while also considering individual item preferences.

A potential allocation that seeks to balance the total perceived value could be:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (high value for Agent 0)
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (high value for Agent 1)
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0)
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1)
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (balance Agent 1's total value)
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (balance Agent 0's total value)

By verifying the total perceived value:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1, 5]: Total value = 84 + 70 + 4 = 158
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 3, 4]: Total value = 87 + 56 + 79 = 222

This allocation gives Agent 1 a higher total value, but it considers the strong preference Agent 1 has for item 2. Adjustments or alternative allocations might be needed depending on specific fairness criteria, but this is a starting point to balance envy-freeness.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
