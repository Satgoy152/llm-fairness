Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  75  91   3  33  40
1  44  91  86  11  61  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as the allocation to the other agent, based on their own valuations. One common approach to achieve this is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while balancing the allocation of items. Here's how we can proceed with the given valuations:

First, let's list the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [14, 75, 91, 3, 33, 40]
- Agent 1: [44, 91, 86, 11, 61, 61]

We can calculate the total valuations for each potential allocation by considering the items that yield the highest values for each agent:

1. **For Agent 0:**
   - High-value items: 2 (91), 1 (75), 5 (40)
   - Total valuation if assigned items [2, 1, 5] = 91 + 75 + 40 = 206

2. **For Agent 1:**
   - High-value items: 1 (91), 2 (86), 4 (61)
   - Total valuation if assigned items [1, 2, 4] = 91 + 86 + 61 = 238

Next, we need to find an allocation where both agents can have a fair share based on their highest valuations:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (91) and item 1 to Agent 1 (91), as both value them highly.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (14) and item 4 to Agent 1 (61) to balance the remaining valuations.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (3) and item 5 to Agent 1 (61).

The final allocation is:

- **Agent 0:** [0, 2, 3]
  - Total valuation: 14 + 91 + 3 = 108
- **Agent 1:** [1, 4, 5]
  - Total valuation: 91 + 61 + 61 = 213

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items with high valuations according to their preferences, which helps maintain a fair division of items.

Now, here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
