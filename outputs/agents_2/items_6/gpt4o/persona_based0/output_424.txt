Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  40  77  91  51  55
1  94  96  84  85  19  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that neither agent would prefer the other's allocation over their own. One approach to ensure this is to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent would have for different allocations of the items:

**Agent 0 Valuations:**
- Item 0: 57
- Item 1: 40
- Item 2: 77
- Item 3: 91
- Item 4: 51
- Item 5: 55

**Agent 1 Valuations:**
- Item 0: 94
- Item 1: 96
- Item 2: 84
- Item 3: 85
- Item 4: 19
- Item 5: 24

Now, let's try to find an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences (by descending value):**  
   - Item 3: 91
   - Item 2: 77
   - Item 0: 57
   - Item 5: 55
   - Item 4: 51
   - Item 1: 40

2. **Agent 1's Preferences (by descending value):**  
   - Item 1: 96
   - Item 0: 94
   - Item 2: 84
   - Item 3: 85
   - Item 5: 24
   - Item 4: 19

To ensure envy-freeness, let's attempt an allocation:

- **Agent 0:**  
  - Item 3 (91)
  - Item 2 (77)
  - Item 5 (55)

- **Agent 1:**  
  - Item 1 (96)
  - Item 0 (94)
  - Item 4 (19)

**Agent 0 Total Valuation:** 91 + 77 + 55 = 223  
**Agent 1 Total Valuation:** 96 + 94 + 19 = 209  

This allocation appears to be a fair and envy-free division as each agent receives a set of items with a high total valuation, and neither agent would prefer the other's allocation based on their personal valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 0, 4]
}
```
