Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  39  93  98  38  92
1  61  52  77  96  72  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 52 77 96 72 88]]
Output:
To find a fair allocation of the items between the two agents while minimizing envy, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This approach is called the "maximin" solution. We will assign items to the agents in a way that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their minimum valuation among all possible allocations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 99 + 39 + 93 + 98 + 38 + 92 = 459
- Agent 1's total valuation: 61 + 52 + 77 + 96 + 72 + 88 = 446

Next, we'll try to allocate the items such that the minimum valuation for each agent is maximized.

One possible allocation that seems fair based on the valuations is:

- Assign items 0, 2, and 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 3, and 4 to Agent 1.

Let's check the valuations for this allocation:

- Valuation for Agent 0: 99 (item 0) + 93 (item 2) + 92 (item 5) = 284
- Valuation for Agent 1: 52 (item 1) + 96 (item 3) + 72 (item 4) = 220

This allocation gives both agents a significant share of their total valuation, and it is quite balanced. 

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
