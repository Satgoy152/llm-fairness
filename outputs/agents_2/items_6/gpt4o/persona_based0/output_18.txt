Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  82  87  85   8  28
1  24  85  50  43  40  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, I'll use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value from their allocated items. This might not always guarantee perfect envy-freeness, but it can help minimize envy by ensuring each agent gets a relatively high value from their allocation.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for each Item by each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: [52, 82, 87, 85, 8, 28]
   - Agent 1: [24, 85, 50, 43, 40, 65]

2. **Evaluate Valuation Differences:**

   - This helps understand which items are more valuable to one agent compared to the other.
   - Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1): [28, -3, 37, 42, -32, -37]

3. **Allocate Items Based on Value Differences:**

   - Assign items that have a higher positive difference to Agent 0.
   - Assign items that have a higher negative difference (or smaller positive difference) to Agent 1.

4. **Allocate Items:**

   - Items 0 and 3 are significantly more valued by Agent 0 compared to Agent 1.
   - Items 1, 4, and 5 are more valued by Agent 1 compared to Agent 0.
   - Item 2 is highly valued by both, but Agent 0 values it significantly more.

5. **Final Allocation:**

   - Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are relatively more valuable to them, aiming to reduce envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
