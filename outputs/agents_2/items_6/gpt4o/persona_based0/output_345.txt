Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  36   7  14  88  57
1  61  84  23  33  22  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [61 84 23 33 22 62]]
Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation and ensure fairness between the two agents, we can use the method of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives (known as the max-min approach). This will help ensure that each agent is as satisfied as possible given their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: 14, 36, 7, 14, 88, 57
- Agent 1's valuations: 61, 84, 23, 33, 22, 62

We need to ensure that both agents receive a fair share of the total value based on their own valuations. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent to ensure they each get a fair share:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (88), and Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (84).

2. Allocate these high-value items:
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. Next, try to balance the remaining allocations based on the remaining highest valuations:
   - Agent 0's next highest valuation after item 4 is item 5 (57).
   - Agent 1's next highest valuation after item 1 is item 5 (62), but since item 5 is also highly valued by Agent 0, let's consider a balanced approach.

4. Allocate remaining items to balance valuations:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (14).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (62).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (33).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (7).

5. Now, check the final valuations for each agent:
   - Agent 0 receives items [4, 0, 2]: Total value = 88 + 14 + 7 = 109
   - Agent 1 receives items [1, 5, 3]: Total value = 84 + 62 + 33 = 179

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least some of the items they value highly. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5, 3]
}
```
