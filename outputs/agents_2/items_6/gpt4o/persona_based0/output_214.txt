Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  31  94  32  10  69
1  47  89   3  50  83  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items between the two agents while aiming for an envy-free division, we should consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to maximize the perceived value for each agent while ensuring that the distribution is fair in terms of total value and the number of items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's valuations: 52, 31, 94, 32, 10, 69
  - Total value: 52 + 31 + 94 + 32 + 10 + 69 = 288

- Agent 1's valuations: 47, 89, 3, 50, 83, 81
  - Total value: 47 + 89 + 3 + 50 + 83 + 81 = 353

Now, let's try to allocate the items to maximize the perceived value for each agent, while ensuring that envy is minimized:

1. **Allocate high-value items first**: Start by assigning the items with the highest valuations for each agent without overlapping, if possible.

2. **Assign remaining items**: After assigning the highest value items, proceed to allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations and ensure that each agent receives a reasonable portion based on their total valuation.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

- Item 2 has the highest valuation for Agent 0, and item 1 has the highest valuation for Agent 1. We will start by assigning these to their respective agents.
- Next, we assign remaining items based on subsequent high valuations where possible.

Based on these principles, the allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 5
  - Total value for Agent 0 = 52 (item 0) + 94 (item 2) + 69 (item 5) = 215

- Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 4
  - Total value for Agent 1 = 89 (item 1) + 50 (item 3) + 83 (item 4) = 222

This allocation ensures that each agent receives three items and the distribution is relatively fair in terms of perceived value, minimizing envy between the agents.

Now, I'll provide the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
