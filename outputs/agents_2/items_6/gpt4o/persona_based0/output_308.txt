Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  20  20   7  14  87
1  34  48  99  96  73  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that neither agent prefers the other's allocation over their own, according to their valuations.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 5
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 20
  - Item 3: 7
  - Item 4: 14
  - Item 5: 87

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 48
  - Item 2: 99
  - Item 3: 96
  - Item 4: 73
  - Item 5: 21

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the following strategy:

1. Identify items with significant value differences between agents. For example, if one agent values an item much more than the other, that item should likely go to the agent who values it more.

2. Try to balance the total value of items each agent receives according to their own valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 87, while Agent 1 values it at 21. It should go to Agent 0.

2. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 99, while Agent 0 values it at 20. It should go to Agent 1.

3. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 96, while Agent 0 values it at 7. It should go to Agent 1.

4. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 48, while Agent 0 values it at 20. It should go to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 73, while Agent 0 values it at 14. It should go to Agent 1.

6. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 34, while Agent 0 values it at 5. It should go to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives: [5]
- Agent 1 receives: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

This allocation gives Agent 0 the item they value most, while Agent 1 receives the rest, which they value more overall. This should mitigate envy, as Agent 0 receives their highest-valued item, and Agent 1 receives a combination of items that they collectively value highly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
