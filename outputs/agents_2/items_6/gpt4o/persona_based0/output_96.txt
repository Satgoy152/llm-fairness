Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40  69  60  57  27  21
1  89  36  13  23  86  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maintaining integer allocations, we can use the concept of maximizing total utility for each agent. We aim to allocate items such that each agent's total value from their allocated items is maximized, ensuring that no agent envies the other.

Let's break down the values each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0 values: [40, 69, 60, 57, 27, 21]
- Agent 1 values: [89, 36, 13, 23, 86, 97]

To start, we can prioritize assigning items to the agent who values them most, which should help minimize envy:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values this item more (89 vs. 40).
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values this more (69 vs. 36).
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values this more (60 vs. 13).
4. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values this more (57 vs. 23).
5. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values this more (86 vs. 27).
6. **Item 5:** Agent 1 values this more (97 vs. 21).

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 4, and 5.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 a total value of \(69 + 60 + 57 = 186\).
- Agent 1 a total value of \(89 + 86 + 97 = 272\).

This allocation maximizes the utility for both agents given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
