Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79   6  58  25  30  49
1  19  54  40  82  49  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation where each agent gets an integer number of items and no agent envies the other, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair portion based on their own valuations, minimizing envy.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [79, 6, 58, 25, 30, 49]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [19, 54, 40, 82, 49, 82]

A fair division often considers maximizing the minimum value each agent receives or minimizing envy. One approach is to allocate items such that each agent receives items they highly value while ensuring that the total perceived value is as even as possible.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Start by giving Agent 0 the item they value the most, which is item 0 (value 79).
2. Allocate to Agent 1 the item they value the most, which is item 3 (value 82).
3. Next, allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as it has their second-highest valuation (value 58).
4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1, as it has their second-highest valuation (value 82).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it has their next highest valuation (value 30).
6. Finally, allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as it is the remaining item.

This allocation ensures that both agents get an equal number of items (3 each) and have a reasonable distribution based on their perceived values.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
