Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89   6  97  21  77   3
1  20  93  76   4  38  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while considering the valuations provided, we can use a method that aims to maximize total value and minimize envy. A common approach is to use the "maximum weighted matching" method, where we assign items based on maximizing each agent's total perceived value.

Here's a step-by-step process:

1. **List Agent Preferences**:
   - Agent 0 values: [89, 6, 97, 21, 77, 3]
   - Agent 1 values: [20, 93, 76, 4, 38, 76]

2. **Calculate Total Value**:
   - Agent 0 total value: 89 + 6 + 97 + 21 + 77 + 3 = 293
   - Agent 1 total value: 20 + 93 + 76 + 4 + 38 + 76 = 307

3. **Prioritize Assignments**:
   - Identify which items are most valued by each agent.
   - Allocate items to the agents starting with the highest-valued items for each, ensuring no overlap and maintaining a balance.

4. **Fair Allocation**:
   - Agent 0's highest-valued items: 2 (97), 0 (89), 4 (77)
   - Agent 1's highest-valued items: 1 (93), 2 (76), 5 (76)

5. **Resolve Conflicts**:
   - Item 2 is highly valued by both agents. We will allocate it to Agent 0, as it provides the highest value to them.
   - Assign remaining high-value items to balance out the allocation.

6. **Final Allocation**:
   - Allocate items to maximize total perceived value and minimize envy while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Based on the above approach, here is a fair allocation of items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

Each agent receives three items, maximizing their perceived value and maintaining a fair distribution.
