Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  42  87  75  14  11
1  91  71  74  34  93  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received at least as much value in their allocation as they perceive in the other agent's allocation. We aim for a division where the perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 67 + 42 + 87 + 75 + 14 + 11 = 296
- Agent 1's total value: 91 + 71 + 74 + 34 + 93 + 14 = 377

Now, let's aim to divide the items such that each agent's perceived value is as equal as possible.

Letâ€™s consider some allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0, 2, 4
   - Value: 67 + 87 + 14 = 168

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 1, 3, 5
   - Value: 71 + 34 + 14 = 119

Both agents have valuable items, but Agent 1 might feel envious due to the allocation of higher-valued items to Agent 0. Let's try another combination for a more balanced allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 1, 3, 5
   - Value: 42 + 75 + 11 = 128

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 0, 2, 4
   - Value: 91 + 74 + 93 = 258

This allocation might create less envy as Agent 0's perceived value is lower than Agent 1's, but Agent 1 might still feel envious due to the overall perceived value. Let's find another possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0, 3, 5
   - Value: 67 + 75 + 11 = 153

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 1, 2, 4
   - Value: 71 + 74 + 93 = 238

This allocation seems more balanced and might minimize envy. Let's finalize this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
