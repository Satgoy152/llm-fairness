Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  44  55  94  10  42
1  75  20  31   2  23  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll consider the concept of "envy-freeness," which ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations provided, we aim to divide the items such that each agent feels they have received their fair share according to their valuations.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their preferences:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(65 + 44 + 55 + 94 + 10 + 42 = 310\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(75 + 20 + 31 + 2 + 23 + 86 = 237\)

Now, let's consider potential allocations that would minimize envy and aim for fairness:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 3 (94) and item 0 (65).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 5 (86) and item 0 (75).

2. **Propose an initial allocation:**
   - Since both agents value item 0 highly, let's attempt to balance the allocations by distributing other items strategically.

3. **Balanced Allocation Strategy:**
   - Give Agent 0 items that maximize their total value without creating significant envy: Item 3 (94), Item 1 (44), Item 2 (55).
   - Give Agent 1 the remaining items, which include some of their highest valued ones: Item 0 (75), Item 5 (86), Item 4 (23).

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences.

**Allocation Summary:**

- Agent 0 receives items: 3, 1, 2 (total valuation: 94 + 44 + 55 = 193)
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 5, 4 (total valuation: 75 + 86 + 23 = 184)

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in a way that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations, minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 2],
    "1": [0, 5, 4]
}
```
