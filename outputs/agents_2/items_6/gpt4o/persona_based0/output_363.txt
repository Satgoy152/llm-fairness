Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26   6  84   8  67  94
1  67  27  40  57  48  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will consider the concept of envy-freeness, which means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as the allocation received by the other agent, from their perspective.

### Valuations Matrix

Let's summarize the valuations for clarity:

- **Agent 0 Valuations:**  
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 6
  - Item 2: 84
  - Item 3: 8
  - Item 4: 67
  - Item 5: 94

- **Agent 1 Valuations:**  
  - Item 0: 67
  - Item 1: 27
  - Item 2: 40
  - Item 3: 57
  - Item 4: 48
  - Item 5: 93

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**  
   - Agent 0's highest values are for items 5 (94) and 2 (84).
   - Agent 1's highest values are for items 0 (67) and 5 (93).

2. **Initial Allocation:**  
   We aim to allocate items to maximize the total value each agent perceives they have received, while ensuring no agent envies the other's allocation. 

3. **Analyzing Envy-Free Allocation:**
   - Since item 5 is highly valued by both agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is balanced.
   - First, allocate item 5 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it slightly more.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as it is their second-highest valued item.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as it offers more value to Agent 1 than to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it offers significant value to Agent 0 compared to the remaining items.
   - Finally, allocate item 1 to Agent 1, filling out their allocation.

### Final Allocation

Given these considerations, the proposed allocation that attempts to be envy-free is:

- **Agent 0:** Items 2, 4, 5
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 1, 3

### JSON Format

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive an integer number of items, totaling all 6 items, and seeks to maintain as much fairness and envy-freeness as possible based on their valuations.
