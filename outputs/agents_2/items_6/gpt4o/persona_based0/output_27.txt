Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  34  99  37  66  62
1  55  89  43  76  35  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering the principle of envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their own bundle of allocated items at least as much as they value the bundle allocated to the other agent.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 35 + 34 + 99 + 37 + 66 + 62 = 333
- Agent 1: 55 + 89 + 43 + 76 + 35 + 54 = 352

Now, let's try to allocate the items such that both agents are satisfied with their allocations:

1. **Assign items based on highest individual valuations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 2 (99).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (89).

2. **Distribute remaining items to balance overall valuations:**

   Let's try distributing the rest of the items while considering remaining values:

   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (since 55 > 35).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (since 37 > 76).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (since 66 > 35).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (since 54 > 62).

Now, let's check the total value each agent receives from their assigned items:

- **Agent 0 receives:** 
  - Items: 2, 3, 4
  - Total value: 99 + 37 + 66 = 202

- **Agent 1 receives:** 
  - Items: 0, 1, 5
  - Total value: 55 + 89 + 54 = 198

Both agents receive close to equal value from their allocations, and the distribution ensures that each agent has at least one of their higher-valued items. This should satisfy the condition of envy-freeness.

The final allocation is:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
