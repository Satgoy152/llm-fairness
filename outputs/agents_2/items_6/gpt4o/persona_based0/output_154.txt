Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  76  45  88  77   5
1  76  11  38  71  87  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent is satisfied with the items they receive compared to what the other agent receives. One approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [81, 76, 45, 88, 77, 5]
- Agent 1: [76, 11, 38, 71, 87, 32]

A simple approach to achieve an envy-free allocation is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while attempting to keep the overall distribution fair.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations:**
   - Item 3 (88)
   - Item 0 (81)
   - Item 4 (77)

2. **Agent 1's highest valuations:**
   - Item 4 (87)
   - Item 0 (76)
   - Item 3 (71)

We need to ensure that both agents receive a fair share, and no item is allocated more than once. In this scenario, let's proceed by attempting to balance the allocation based on item values:

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 0, 3, 5
  - Total valuation: 81 + 88 + 5 = 174

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 1, 2, 4
  - Total valuation: 11 + 38 + 87 = 136

This allocation seems to provide a reasonable balance given the constraints. Agent 0 receives higher total valuation, but the division of items reflects their individual preferences for the high-value items.

### Final JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed between the 2 agents, and each agent has items they value relatively highly.
