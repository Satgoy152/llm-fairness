Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  11  35  13  31  15
1  33  30  12  16  16  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78 11 35 13 31 15]
 [33 30 12 16 16 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while striving for envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations of each agent and try to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation for their allocated items is as balanced as possible.

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: [78, 11, 35, 13, 31, 15]
- Agent 1: [33, 30, 12, 16, 16, 81]

### Steps for Allocation:
1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 78.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 81.

2. **Allocate High-Value Items:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - After assigning the highest-value items, check the remaining items to fairly distribute them based on remaining values.

4. **Allocate Based on Remaining Valuations:**
   - Remaining items: 1, 2, 3, 4
   - Agent 0 remaining values: [11, 35, 13, 31]
   - Agent 1 remaining values: [30, 12, 16, 16]
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (higher value: 30 vs 11).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (higher value: 35 vs 12).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (higher value: 16 vs 13).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (higher value: 31 vs 16).

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, 5.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
