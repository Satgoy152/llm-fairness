Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2  3   4   5
0  94  65  36  9  10  40
1  66  43  99  7  42  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that considers envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the allocation given to the other agent. This can be challenging, but we can try to minimize envy by considering the valuations.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 94 + 65 + 36 + 9 + 10 + 40 = 254
- Agent 1's total value: 66 + 43 + 99 + 7 + 42 + 87 = 344

To find a fair allocation, we can aim for each agent to get items that maximize their own total valuation while considering the other agent's valuations to minimize envy. We'll consider allocating the items based on who values them more:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 94, Agent 1 values it at 66. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 values it at 43. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 values it at 99. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 values it at 7. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 10, Agent 1 values it at 42. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 values it at 87. Allocate to Agent 1.

This allocation attempts to balance the valuation each agent gets from their items. Let's check the total valuation for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0's allocated items: [0, 1, 3]
  - Total value: 94 + 65 + 9 = 168

- Agent 1's allocated items: [2, 4, 5]
  - Total value: 99 + 42 + 87 = 228

While this allocation isn't perfectly envy-free, it respects the higher valuations where possible. Given the constraints of integer allocations and the input table, this is a reasonable division.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5]
}
```
