Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  84  91  25  73  25
1  97  26  73  42   9  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we need to ensure that each agent receives a set of items such that no agent envies the other, or at least minimize the envy as much as possible given the discrete nature of the allocation. We will evaluate the valuations of each item by both agents and try to distribute the items to minimize envy.

Let's consider each item and its valuation by each agent:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 values it at 97.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 values it at 26.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 values it at 73.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 values it at 42.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 values it at 9.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 values it at 73.

A simple approach is to allocate each item to the agent that values it more, with the goal of balancing the total valuation each agent receives. However, we must ensure each agent gets at least some items while minimizing the envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 99, higher than Agent 1's valuation of 97).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 84, higher than Agent 1's valuation of 26).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 91, higher than Agent 1's valuation of 73).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 42, higher than Agent 0's valuation of 25).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 73, higher than Agent 1's valuation of 9).
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 73, higher than Agent 0's valuation of 25).

Now, let's check the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 4 with total valuations: 99 + 84 + 91 + 73 = 347.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 5 with total valuations: 42 + 73 = 115.

Agent 0 receives significantly more value. To balance this, we can consider swapping one item to reduce the difference. Let's try swapping item 2 or 4 with item 5:

Swap item 4 with item 5:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 5 with total valuations: 99 + 84 + 91 + 25 = 299.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4 with total valuations: 42 + 73 = 115.

This doesn't help much either. Let's try another swap:

Swap item 2 with item 5:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 4, and 5 with total valuations: 99 + 84 + 73 + 25 = 281.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3 with total valuations: 73 + 42 = 115.

This seems to be a better allocation. Let's finalize it:

{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
