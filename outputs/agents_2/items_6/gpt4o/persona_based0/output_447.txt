Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  12  23  59  81  55
1  52  46  12  57  70  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the total happiness of both agents while aiming to minimize envy. One approach is to use the Envy-Free up to One Item (EF1) criterion, which ensures that any envy an agent has can be eliminated by removing at most one item from another agent's allocation.

Given the valuations:

Agent 0:  
- Item 0: 36  
- Item 1: 12  
- Item 2: 23  
- Item 3: 59  
- Item 4: 81  
- Item 5: 55  

Agent 1:  
- Item 0: 52  
- Item 1: 46  
- Item 2: 12  
- Item 3: 57  
- Item 4: 70  
- Item 5: 32  

We can attempt to allocate the items in a way that balances the perceived value for each agent:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0's highest value items: 4 (81), 3 (59)
   - Agent 1's highest value items: 0 (52), 4 (70)

2. **Start by allocating the highest value items to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 4.
   - Agent 1 gets item 0.

3. **Allocate remaining items by comparing relative values:**
   - Agent 0 has a high value for item 3 (59), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 as they value it more than Agent 0 does.
   - Agent 1's next high-value item is 5 (32), so assign item 5 to Agent 1.
   - The remaining item 2 (valued at 23 by Agent 0 and 12 by Agent 1) goes to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 5

This allocation tries to balance the total values each agent receives while ensuring that neither agent is significantly envious of the other's allocation.

### Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
