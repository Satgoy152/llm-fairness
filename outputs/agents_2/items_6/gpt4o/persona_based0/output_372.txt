Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  99  87  62  49  30
1  66   4  75  27  58   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation based on the given valuations and ensure envy-freeness, we will aim to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive. The objective is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent feels they received a fair share, given their valuations.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations for each item:

- **Agent 0's valuations**: 
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 1: 99
  - Item 2: 87
  - Item 3: 62
  - Item 4: 49
  - Item 5: 30

- **Agent 1's valuations**: 
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 1: 4
  - Item 2: 75
  - Item 3: 27
  - Item 4: 58
  - Item 5: 7

To make a fair allocation:

1. **Assign items based on highest individual valuations**:
   - Agent 0 values items 0, 1, and 2 very highly compared to Agent 1, so we start by assigning these to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest among those left, so we assign item 4 to Agent 1.

2. **Continue assigning remaining items**:
   - Item 3 has a higher valuation for Agent 0 than Agent 1, so we assign it to Agent 0.
   - Item 5, while not highly valued by either, is slightly more valuable to Agent 0 than Agent 1, but to balance the distribution of items, we assign it to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 2, and 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 4 and 5

This allocation provides a balance where each agent receives items that they value relatively highly compared to the other agent, helping to ensure envy-freeness.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5]
}
```
