Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  93  32  78  91  34
1  25  24  35  73   9  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider their valuations of the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they received their fair share based on their valuations. We will try to ensure that no agent envies the other's allocation, or at least minimize envy.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 80 + 93 + 32 + 78 + 91 + 34 = 408
- Agent 1's total valuation: 25 + 24 + 35 + 73 + 9 + 40 = 206

Now, let's try to allocate the items in a way that considers these valuations and aims to minimize envy. We need to look for allocations where each agent maximizes their total valuation from the items they receive.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (93), 4 (91), 0 (80)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 3 (73), 5 (40), 2 (35)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 4, and 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 3, 5, and 2.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0's received valuation: 93 + 91 + 80 = 264
- Agent 1's received valuation: 73 + 40 + 35 = 148

The allocation minimizes potential envy while respecting each agent's valuations.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation respects the condition of distributing exactly 6 items and provides each agent with items they value highly.
