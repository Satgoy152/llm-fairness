Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  26  47   0  33  79
1  47  23  27  99  52  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 23 27 99 52 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as the other agent's allocation, according to their valuations.

Given the valuation table:

```
          0   1   2   3   4   5
Agent 0:  7  26  47   0  33  79
Agent 1: 47  23  27  99  52  76
```

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. **Agent 1 has high value for item 3:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

2. **Comparing values for remaining high-value items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most at 79.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 47.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 and item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items with the goal of minimizing envy:**
   - Items left: 1, 2, 4.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 more than Agent 1 does (47 vs 27).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 more than Agent 0 does (52 vs 33).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Item 1 is left: Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 does (26 vs 23).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 2, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 3, 4

This allocation aims to minimize envy by considering each agent's highest valuations and distributing items accordingly. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
