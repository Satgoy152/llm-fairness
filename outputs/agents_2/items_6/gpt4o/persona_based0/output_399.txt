Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  30  91  77  44  71
1  91   6  91  57   6  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll look for a distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations. The goal is to minimize envy, where each agent should ideally prefer their own bundle of items over the other agent's bundle.

### Valuations Matrix:
- Agent 0: [43, 30, 91, 77, 44, 71]
- Agent 1: [91, 6, 91, 57, 6, 45]

### Total Valuations:
- Agent 0's total valuation: 43 + 30 + 91 + 77 + 44 + 71 = 356
- Agent 1's total valuation: 91 + 6 + 91 + 57 + 6 + 45 = 296

### Strategy:
1. Each agent's valuation of items is considered, and items are allocated in such a way that tries to balance the perceived total value for each agent.
2. Opt for allocations where agents have higher valuations for their items to minimize envy.

### Allocation Process:
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (91), which is also highly valued by Agent 0 (43). Prioritizing Agent 1's higher valuation, we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value item 2 at 91. To maintain balance and to avoid envy, we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Item 3, valued at 77 by Agent 0 and 57 by Agent 1, will go to Agent 0 due to a higher valuation.
- For items 1 and 4, Agent 0 has higher valuations (30 and 44) than Agent 1 (6 each). To maintain fairness, let's allocate item 4 to Agent 0 and item 1 to Agent 1.
- Item 5 will be allocated to Agent 1 as it provides a higher total valuation balance.

### Resulting Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 5]

### Check Total Allocations:
- Total items allocated to Agent 0: 3
- Total items allocated to Agent 1: 3
- Total items allocated: 6, satisfying the condition.

### Final Allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
