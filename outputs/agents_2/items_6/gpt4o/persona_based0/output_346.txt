Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  94  24  31  14  13
1  39  86  43  20  98  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items while aiming for an envy-free distribution, we first need to understand the valuations each agent places on the items. Here's the valuation matrix extracted from the table:

- Agent 0 values: [28, 94, 24, 31, 14, 13]
- Agent 1 values: [39, 86, 43, 20, 98, 95]

Next, we calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 28 + 94 + 24 + 31 + 14 + 13 = 204
- Total value for Agent 1: 39 + 86 + 43 + 20 + 98 + 95 = 381

To achieve a fair allocation, we'll distribute the items such that the perceived fairness is maintained and the envy is minimized.

**Strategy**:
1. Consider the highest value item for each agent.
2. Allocate items starting from the highest valued items downwards, while ensuring that the distribution remains as fair as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 4** is valued highest by Agent 1 (98) and significantly lower by Agent 0 (14). Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 5** is the next highest for Agent 1 (95) and very low for Agent 0 (13). Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 1** is highly valued by Agent 0 (94) and slightly less by Agent 1 (86). Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 0** is next valued by Agent 1 (39) and less by Agent 0 (28). Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 2** is valued more by Agent 1 (43) than Agent 0 (24). Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 3** is left, valued similarly by both agents, but slightly more by Agent 0 (31) than Agent 1 (20). Allocate to Agent 0.

Now let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1 receives: Items 0, 2, 4, and 5

Finally, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy and ensures that the total number of items allocated is 6, as required.
