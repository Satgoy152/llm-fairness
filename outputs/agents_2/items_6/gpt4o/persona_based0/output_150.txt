Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  76  54  92  10  81
1  11  52  41  99  32  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [11 52 41 99 32 81]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation would make each agent feel they have received as much value as any other agent, given their own valuations.

Here are the steps to go through the allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 91 + 76 + 54 + 92 + 10 + 81 = 404
   - Agent 1: 11 + 52 + 41 + 99 + 32 + 81 = 316

2. **Rank Items by Value for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0 values: [3 (92), 0 (91), 5 (81), 1 (76), 2 (54), 4 (10)]
   - Agent 1 values: [3 (99), 5 (81), 1 (52), 2 (41), 4 (32), 0 (11)]

3. **Allocate Items to Maximize Each Agent's Valuation**:
   - Start from the most valued items for each agent and avoid conflicts.
   - Item 3 is the highest valued for both agents, but agent 1 values it more (99 > 92), so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
   - For agent 0, allocate their next highest valued item that hasn't been taken yet: item 0.
   - Continue this process while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives: [0, 1, 2]
   - Agent 1 receives: [3, 4, 5]

This solution provides a fair division based on the rankings of item values, ensuring that each agent gets approximately half of the total value according to their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
