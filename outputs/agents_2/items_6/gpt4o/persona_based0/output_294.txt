Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73   4  70   4  86  54
1  60  73  76  87  54  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's begin by examining the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [73, 4, 70, 4, 86, 54]
- Agent 1's valuations: [60, 73, 76, 87, 54, 42]

First, calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 73 + 4 + 70 + 4 + 86 + 54 = 291
- Total value for Agent 1: 60 + 73 + 76 + 87 + 54 + 42 = 392

Next, let's consider allocations aiming to balance these valuations:

1. Assign items with high personal value to each agent where possible.
2. Avoid giving an agent too many items they value significantly less than the other.

Let's attempt an allocation and verify fairness:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value: 73) and Agent 1 (value: 60)
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value: 73) and Agent 0 (value: 4)
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value: 70) and Agent 1 (value: 76)
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value: 87) and Agent 0 (value: 4)
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (value: 86) and Agent 1 (value: 54)
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value: 54) and Agent 1 (value: 42)

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3

This allocation ensures:

- Agent 0's sum of values: 73 + 70 + 86 + 54 = 283
- Agent 1's sum of values: 73 + 87 = 160

While the final allocation is not perfectly balanced in terms of total perceived value, it respects their preferences for high-value items as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
