Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  31  18  73  21  66
1  70  95  70  86  78  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 95 70 86 78 46]]
Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items between the two agents while minimizing envy, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

- Agent 0: [36, 31, 18, 73, 21, 66]
- Agent 1: [70, 95, 70, 86, 78, 46]

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 36 + 31 + 18 + 73 + 21 + 66 = 245
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 70 + 95 + 70 + 86 + 78 + 46 = 445

2. **Strategy for Fair Allocation:**
   - We should try to maximize each agent's perceived share based on their own valuations.
   - We can consider giving each agent the items they value most to minimize envy.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Sort the items by each agent's valuation and assign high-valued items to each agent.

For Agent 0:
- Highest value items: Item 3 (73), Item 5 (66), and Item 0 (36).

For Agent 1:
- Highest value items: Item 1 (95), Item 4 (78), and Item 2 (70).

**Allocations:**

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 3, 5]
- Agent 1 receives items: [1, 2, 4]

This distribution gives each agent high-valued items according to their preferences, and all items are allocated.

**Final Allocation in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
