Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  49  71  60  74   6
1  74  40  36  89  16  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as closely as possible. Envy-freeness implies that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own based on their valuations. 

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [30, 49, 71, 60, 74, 6]
- Agent 1's valuations: [74, 40, 36, 89, 16, 73]

We will use the following steps to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0: 30 + 49 + 71 + 60 + 74 + 6 = 290
   - Agent 1: 74 + 40 + 36 + 89 + 16 + 73 = 328

2. We aim to distribute the items to balance the total value each agent receives, ideally close to half of their total valuation.

3. Start by assigning items based on the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring that both agents get a fair share.

**Allocation Process:**

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 74) because it is Agent 0's highest value.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 89) because it is Agent 1's highest value.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 71), their next highest value after assigning what they value most.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 74), since it's highly valued by Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 73), as it helps balance the valuation.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 49), and it ensures all items are allocated.

The allocations are made to achieve a balance where each agent's total value is as fair as possible:

- Agent 0 receives items: [1, 2, 4] with a total valuation of 49 + 71 + 74 = 194
- Agent 1 receives items: [0, 3, 5] with a total valuation of 74 + 89 + 73 = 236

While not perfectly balanced, this allocation minimizes envy given the constraints.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
