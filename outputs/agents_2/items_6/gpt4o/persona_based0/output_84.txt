Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  94  46  13   2  15
1  26  30  90  64  28  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. Our goal is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as any other possible allocation given the constraints.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [5, 94, 46, 13, 2, 15]
- Agent 1 values: [26, 30, 90, 64, 28, 50]

A reasonable approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations for those items, attempting to minimize envy and ensure a fair division.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (94)
   - Second highest: Item 2 (46)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (90)
   - Second highest: Item 3 (64)

3. **Assigning Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Item 1 (valued at 94 by Agent 0) is given to Agent 0.
   - Item 3 (valued at 64 by Agent 1) is given to Agent 1.

4. **Handling Remaining Items:**
   - Items 0, 2, 4, and 5 are left to allocate.
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 highly (90), so assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Items 0, 4, and 5 are left. Distribute based on next highest preferences to ensure balance:
     - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0).
     - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it more).
     - Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has a slight preference).

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 3, 4

The allocations ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valuations and minimize envy as much as possible.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
