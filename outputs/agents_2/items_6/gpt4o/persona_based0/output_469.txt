Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  13  19  97  45  66
1  18   4  57  61  76  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Let's examine the total valuations each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 66 + 13 + 19 + 97 + 45 + 66 = 306
- Agent 1's total valuation: 18 + 4 + 57 + 61 + 76 + 36 = 252

Given that Agent 0 values the items more overall, we will try to assign the items in a way that balances the perceived value from both agents' perspectives.

We will consider the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  13  19  97  45  66
1  18   4  57  61  76  36
```

To achieve an envy-free allocation or a balanced allocation, we can follow these steps:

1. Assign the highest-valued item of Agent 0 to Agent 0 and the highest-valued item of Agent 1 to Agent 1.
2. Continue assigning remaining items to balance the total perceived value for both agents.

Let's proceed:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (97), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (76), so assign item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Agent 0's remaining total valuation: 66 (item 0) + 13 (item 1) + 19 (item 2) + 66 (item 5) = 164
- Agent 1's remaining total valuation: 18 (item 0) + 4 (item 1) + 57 (item 2) + 36 (item 5) = 115

We aim to balance these remaining valuations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest remaining value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest remaining value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (remaining item).

Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 4

Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
