Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  51  59  81  46  92
1  74  74  14  11  80  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly, we can aim for an allocation that tries to balance the perceived value each agent receives, ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: \(77 + 51 + 59 + 81 + 46 + 92 = 406\)
- Agent 1's total value: \(74 + 74 + 14 + 11 + 80 + 51 = 304\)

Next, we will try to allocate the items such that the perceived value for each agent is roughly equal according to their own valuations. 

One possible envy-free allocation strategy is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while balancing the total value received by each agent:

1. **Allocate item 0:** Agent 0 values it more (77 vs 74).
2. **Allocate item 1:** Agent 1 values it equally as Agent 0 (both 74), but to balance value distribution, give it to Agent 1.
3. **Allocate item 2:** Agent 0 values it more (59 vs 14).
4. **Allocate item 3:** Agent 0 values it more (81 vs 11).
5. **Allocate item 4:** Agent 1 values it more (80 vs 46).
6. **Allocate item 5:** Agent 0 values it more (92 vs 51).

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 4

Now, let's check the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0's total value received: \(77 + 59 + 81 + 92 = 309\)
- Agent 1's total value received: \(74 + 80 = 154\)

The allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value, aiming to minimize envy and create a fair division of the items.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
