Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  92  32  78  20  76
1  70  81  52  20  60  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 81 52 20 60 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to find an allocation where each agent receives items such that they do not envy the other agent's allocation, or the envy is minimized. This involves ensuring that the perceived value each agent has for their own allocation is as high as possible given the constraints.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values: [33, 92, 32, 78, 20, 76]
- Agent 1 values: [70, 81, 52, 20, 60, 95]

Given these valuations, we need to allocate the items such that:

1. Each agent receives a fair share of value based on their preferences.
2. All items are allocated, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.

A potential allocation can be determined by analyzing the relative values each agent assigns to the items. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values item 5 the most (95 vs. 76), so allocate item 5 to agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 highly (92 vs. 81), so allocate item 1 to agent 0.
3. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values item 3 highly (78 vs. 20), so allocate item 3 to agent 0.
4. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 highly (70 vs. 33), so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
5. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values item 2 more (52 vs. 32), so allocate item 2 to agent 1.
6. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values item 4 more (60 vs. 20), so allocate item 4 to agent 1.

This allocation gives each agent a fair balance according to their preferences:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 4, and 5

Now, presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
