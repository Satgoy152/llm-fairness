Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  64  50  91  31  21
1  27  62  72  29  31  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1), we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- **Agent 0's valuations**: [86, 64, 50, 91, 31, 21]
- **Agent 1's valuations**: [27, 62, 72, 29, 31, 51]

One approach to achieve fairness is to prioritize the allocation of items that are more valuable to one agent and less valuable to the other. We can use the concept of maximizing the sum of utilities for each agent and trying to balance them.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 3**: This item has a high valuation for Agent 0 (91) and a relatively low valuation for Agent 1 (29). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0**: This item has a high valuation for Agent 0 (86) and a low valuation for Agent 1 (27). Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: This item has a higher valuation for Agent 1 (72) compared to Agent 0 (50). Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 1**: This item has a higher valuation for Agent 0 (64) compared to Agent 1 (62), but the difference is small. Allocate to Agent 0 to balance the distribution.
5. **Item 5**: This item has a higher valuation for Agent 1 (51) compared to Agent 0 (21). Allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 4**: This item has similar valuations for both agents. However, since Agent 1 has fewer items, allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Receives items [3, 0, 1] with valuations [91, 86, 64].
- **Agent 1**: Receives items [2, 5, 4] with valuations [72, 51, 31].

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5, 4]
}
```
