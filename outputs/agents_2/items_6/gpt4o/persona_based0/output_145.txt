Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81   0  84  95  82  49
1  25  31  35  55   7  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, a common approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent values their allocated set of items at least as much as any other agent's set. In this case, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation and try to find a distribution that minimizes envy.

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 81
- Item 1: 0
- Item 2: 84
- Item 3: 95
- Item 4: 82
- Item 5: 49

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 25
- Item 1: 31
- Item 2: 35
- Item 3: 55
- Item 4: 7
- Item 5: 20

The goal is to ensure that both agents receive items such that no agent envies the other. We can proceed by allocating items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while distributing all items.

One potential allocation is as follows:
- Assign items with higher value to each agent, considering both the total value and balanced distribution.

Let's analyze a potential allocation:

1. Allocate items with high value for Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3
   - Agent 0's total value: 81 + 84 + 95 = 260

2. Allocate remaining items to Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 5
   - Agent 1's total value: 31 + 7 + 20 = 58

This allocation results in Agent 0 having a significantly higher total value, which is not balanced. Let's try to adjust the allocation to ensure a more balanced distribution:

Let's attempt another allocation:

1. Allocate items for Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 5
   - Agent 0's total value: 81 + 95 + 49 = 225

2. Allocate remaining items to Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 4
   - Agent 1's total value: 31 + 35 + 7 = 73

This allocation is more balanced, though not perfectly envy-free. However, given the constraints, this allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of high-value items.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
