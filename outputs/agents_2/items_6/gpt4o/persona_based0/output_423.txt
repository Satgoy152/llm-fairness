Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1  2   3   4   5
0  83  90  7  78  21  44
1  73  28  8  82  73  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [73 28  8 82 73 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim to achieve a division where neither agent envies the other, if possible.

Let's first evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0's total valuation:**
  - Item 0: 83
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 7
  - Item 3: 78
  - Item 4: 21
  - Item 5: 44
  - **Total: 323**

- **Agent 1's total valuation:**
  - Item 0: 73
  - Item 1: 28
  - Item 2: 8
  - Item 3: 82
  - Item 4: 73
  - Item 5: 98
  - **Total: 362**

Now, let's try to allocate the items such that each agent receives a total valuation that is as close as possible, thus minimizing envy. Given the significant difference in individual item valuations, we'll aim to balance the total valuations for each agent.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Start by allocating items that one agent values significantly higher than the other.
2. Adjust the allocation to balance the total valuation.

**Agent 0's higher-valued items:**
- Item 1: 90 vs 28
- Item 0: 83 vs 73

**Agent 1's higher-valued items:**
- Item 5: 98 vs 44
- Item 4: 73 vs 21

Based on this, a possible fair allocation is:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 2
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 83 + 90 + 7 = 180
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 73 + 28 + 8 = 109

- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 4, 5
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 78 + 21 + 44 = 143
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 82 + 73 + 98 = 253

This allocation minimizes the valuation difference and gives each agent a reasonable share based on their preferences.

### Allocation:

{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
