Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  78  76  32  12  75
1  27  82  91  42  16  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. In simple terms, an allocation is envy-free if each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent.

Let's examine the valuations for each item and determine a fair distribution:

| Item | Agent 0 Valuation | Agent 1 Valuation |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
|  0   |        95         |        27         |
|  1   |        78         |        82         |
|  2   |        76         |        91         |
|  3   |        32         |        42         |
|  4   |        12         |        16         |
|  5   |        75         |        92         |

A possible fair allocation could be determined by giving each agent items that maximize their individual valuations while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 0 and 1 based on high valuations of 95 and 78, respectively.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 2, 5, and 3 due to high valuations of 91, 92, and 42, respectively.

Given these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Receives items 0 and 1.
- **Agent 1**: Receives items 2, 3, 4, and 5.

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 gets their top-valued items, while Agent 1 receives the combination of items that makes them happier overall based on their valuation. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation should be envy-free as each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their satisfaction based on their individual valuations.
