Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  88  17  67  31  91
1  64  39  40  84  50  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while minimizing envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent feels they have a fair share based on their valuations.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 29 + 88 + 17 + 67 + 31 + 91 = 323
- Agent 1's total valuation: 64 + 39 + 40 + 84 + 50 + 77 = 354

Next, we want to divide the items between the agents in such a way that each agent's total value from their allocated items is as fair as possible compared to their own valuation of all items.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High-value items based on Agent 0's perspective: Item 5 (91), Item 1 (88), Item 3 (67)
   - Total value for Agent 0 with these items: 91 + 88 + 67 = 246

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High-value items based on Agent 1's perspective: Item 3 (84), Item 5 (77), Item 0 (64)
   - Total value for Agent 1 with these items: 84 + 77 + 64 = 225

However, we must ensure each agent receives exactly three items in this allocation.

Let's refine the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 (88), 2 (17), 5 (91)
  - Total value for Agent 0: 88 + 17 + 91 = 196

- **Agent 1**: Items 0 (64), 3 (84), 4 (50)
  - Total value for Agent 1: 64 + 84 + 50 = 198

Although not perfectly envy-free, this allocation provides a near balance, with neither agent feeling significantly disadvantaged based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, with each agent receiving three items, and aims to minimize any potential envy based on their respective valuations.
