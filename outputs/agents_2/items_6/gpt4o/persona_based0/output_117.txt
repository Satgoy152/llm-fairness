Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  14  51  98  22  37
1  13  88  10  37   8  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items to the agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. We will aim to distribute the items so that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share based on their individual valuations.

The valuations matrix is as follows:

- Agent 0: [64, 14, 51, 98, 22, 37]
- Agent 1: [13, 88, 10, 37, 8, 61]

We need to allocate these 6 items between the two agents. 

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's highest valued item is item 3 (98).
   - Agent 1's highest valued item is item 1 (88).

2. **Allocate Highest Valued Items:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items Based on Relative Valuation:**
   - For the remaining items (0, 2, 4, 5), we evaluate the relative preference each agent has for the remaining items.

- **Item 0:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 values it at 13. 
  - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

- **Item 2:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 values it at 10. 
  - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

- **Item 4:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 8.
  - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

- **Item 5:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 values it at 61.
  - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

4. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [0, 2, 3, 4]
   - Agent 1: [1, 5]

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by considering each agent's relative valuation of the items, ensuring that both agents feel they receive a fair portion based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5]
}
```
