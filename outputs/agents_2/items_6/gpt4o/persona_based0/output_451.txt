Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  44  21  84  50  43
1  61  41  75  69  66  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation. This often involves maximizing each agent's total value for the items they receive, while keeping both as satisfied as possible given their valuations.

Let's calculate the total value for each agent if they were to receive each item:

For Agent 0:
- Item 0: 52
- Item 1: 44
- Item 2: 21
- Item 3: 84
- Item 4: 50
- Item 5: 43

For Agent 1:
- Item 0: 61
- Item 1: 41
- Item 2: 75
- Item 3: 69
- Item 4: 66
- Item 5: 55

Now, let's allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent first:
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 the most (84).
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 the most (75).

2. Assign the next highest remaining item for each agent:
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 the next (61).
   - Agent 0 values Item 4 the next (50).

3. Continue assigning items to balance the total value:
   - Agent 1 can take Item 5 (55).
   - Agent 0 can take Item 1 (44).

Now, let's check the total value for each agent:
- Agent 0: 84 (Item 3) + 50 (Item 4) + 44 (Item 1) = 178
- Agent 1: 75 (Item 2) + 61 (Item 0) + 55 (Item 5) = 191

This allocation gives both agents a high total value, and while not perfectly equal, it minimizes envy given the discrete nature of the items.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
