Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  46  26  98  17  34  49
1  97  17   8  34  43  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to the other agent more than their own allocation.

Here's the table of valuations for the two agents:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  46  26  98  17  34  49
1  97  17   8  34  43  25
```

To achieve envy-freeness, we can apply the following logic:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the highest (98), so it is a good candidate to allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest (97), so it is a logical choice to allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

After these allocations, we have:

- **Agent 0** has item 2.
- **Agent 1** has item 0.

Now, let's proceed to allocate the remaining items:

3. For the remaining items, let's compare valuations and aim for envy-freeness:
   - **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 26, and Agent 1 values it at 17. Thus, allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 17, and Agent 1 values it at 34. Thus, allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 34, and Agent 1 values it at 43. Thus, allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   - **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 49, and Agent 1 values it at 25. Thus, allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocation, which is fair and envy-free given the valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [2, 1, 5]
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 3, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items (3 each in this case) and the total number of items allocated is 6.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
