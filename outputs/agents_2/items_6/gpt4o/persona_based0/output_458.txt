Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  82  56  37  54  66
1  91  96  18  25  19  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents (0 and 1), we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy or is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values the items as follows:

   - Item 0: 48
   - Item 1: 82
   - Item 2: 56
   - Item 3: 37
   - Item 4: 54
   - Item 5: 66

2. **Agent 1** values the items as follows:

   - Item 0: 91
   - Item 1: 96
   - Item 2: 18
   - Item 3: 25
   - Item 4: 19
   - Item 5: 41

A straightforward approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the total value each agent receives, which should minimize envy. Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** should receive items that maximize their total valuation based on their preferences relative to Agent 1.

- **Agent 1** should receive items that maximize their valuation based on their preferences relative to Agent 0.

After analyzing the valuations:

- **Agent 0** receives items: 1, 2, 3
  - Total value = 82 + 56 + 37 = 175

- **Agent 1** receives items: 0, 4, 5
  - Total value = 91 + 19 + 41 = 151

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items that they value highly, minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
