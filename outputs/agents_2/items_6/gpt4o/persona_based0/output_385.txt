Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54  79  19  51  68  59
1  13  84  27  34  20  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming to minimize envy, let's consider the valuations and try to find an allocation where each agent is satisfied with their share. Ideally, we want each agent to feel like they are getting at least as much value as they perceive the other agent to be getting.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [54, 79, 19, 51, 68, 59]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [13, 84, 27, 34, 20, 32]

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest value for both agents; Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 at 84.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 because they value it highest.

2. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 at 13.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 at 20.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 at 32.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 at 34.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

6. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 at 27.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

### Allocation Results:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 4, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 2

This allocation considers both the individual valuations and attempts to balance total perceived value. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 2]
}
```
