Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  83  84  26  36  33
1  15  14  86  79  36  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that reduces envy and is as fair as possible. Let's analyze the valuations and proceed with the allocation:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 59
- Item 1: 83
- Item 2: 84
- Item 3: 26
- Item 4: 36
- Item 5: 33

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 15
- Item 1: 14
- Item 2: 86
- Item 3: 79
- Item 4: 36
- Item 5: 16

### Allocation Strategy

1. Since agent 0 values items 1 and 2 (83 and 84) highly, we will consider allocating these to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 (86) highly, but it is also highly valued by agent 0. To balance, we'll assign item 2 to agent 0 and compensate agent 1 elsewhere.
3. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (79) among remaining items, so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
4. Agent 0 has a relatively balanced valuation for item 0 compared to agent 1, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 since it's equally valued by both agents (36), but agent 1 has fewer items assigned so far.
6. Lastly, allocate item 5 to agent 1 as it balances the total number of items.

### Final Allocation

Based on this strategy, we can present the allocations as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the overall satisfaction between the agents, considering their individual valuations and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
