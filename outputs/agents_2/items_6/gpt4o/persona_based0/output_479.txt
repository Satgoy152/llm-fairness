Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  96  95  62  23  40
1  39   9  41  92  91  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

First, let's sum up the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0's total value: 85 + 96 + 95 + 62 + 23 + 40 = 401
- Agent 1's total value: 39 + 9 + 41 + 92 + 91 + 12 = 284

Given these valuations, we need to distribute the items to maximize fairness. A common approach is to give each agent the items they value most, while ensuring that the other agent does not envy the allocation.

Here's a possible item allocation:

1. Let's start by allocating the highest valued items for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (96).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (91).

2. Next, we allocate the second most valued items:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 (95).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 (92).

3. Allocate the remaining items by comparing the next highest values:
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (85), Item 5 (40).
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (41).

In this allocation, Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, 2, and 5, and Agent 1 gets items 3 and 4. This allocation attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent.

Now, here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed and each agent has an integer number of items.
