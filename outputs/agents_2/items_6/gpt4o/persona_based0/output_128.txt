Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82  32  22  94  36  96
1  21  17  90  96  63  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division, we'll use the concept of envy-freeness, which aims to allocate items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given that there are two agents and six items, each agent will receive three items.

Let's evaluate a possible allocation:

**Step 1: Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.**

- Agent 0's total valuation: 82 + 32 + 22 + 94 + 36 + 96 = 362
- Agent 1's total valuation: 21 + 17 + 90 + 96 + 63 + 28 = 315

**Step 2: Find an allocation that is as fair as possible.**

We need to allocate items to minimize envy. One potential approach is to assign items based on each agent's highest valuation.

**Step 3: Allocate items:**

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 5 (value 96)
  - Item 3 (value 94)
  - Item 0 (value 82)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 2 (value 90)
  - Item 4 (value 63)
  - Item 1 (value 17)

**Step 4: Verify the allocation:**

- Agent 0's allocation: [5, 3, 0]
  - Total value: 96 + 94 + 82 = 272

- Agent 1's allocation: [2, 4, 1]
  - Total value: 90 + 63 + 17 = 170

Both agents have received three items each, and the allocation aims to minimize envy by giving each agent items that they value highly compared to the alternative options.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3, 0],
    "1": [2, 4, 1]
}
```
