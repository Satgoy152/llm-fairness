Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  66  61  45  88  19
1  45  95  90  51  76  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items such that they perceive their share to be as fair as possible, ideally minimizing envy between the agents. Given that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated, we can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:** First, compute the total value each agent assigns to all the items combined.

   - Agent 0: 55 + 66 + 61 + 45 + 88 + 19 = 334
   - Agent 1: 45 + 95 + 90 + 51 + 76 + 84 = 441

2. **Determine Proportional Value:** Since there are two agents and six items, ideally each agent should receive half the total value of all items if the total value were equally distributed. However, we need to allocate items in such a way that the actual perceived value is balanced.

3. **Allocate Items:** We will allocate items to each agent by attempting to maximize each agent's perceived share while minimizing potential envy. A common heuristic is to allocate items starting with the item that has the highest difference in valuation between the two agents, ensuring each agent has at least three items as possible and attempting to balance the total perceived value.

Let's go through a possible allocation:

- **Item 1 (66 vs. 95):** This item is valued significantly higher by Agent 1, so it will go to Agent 1.
- **Item 4 (88 vs. 76):** This item is valued higher by Agent 0, so it will go to Agent 0.
- **Item 2 (61 vs. 90):** Higher value for Agent 1, allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 5 (19 vs. 84):** Higher value for Agent 1, allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 0 (55 vs. 45):** Higher value for Agent 0, allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3 (45 vs. 51):** Slightly higher for Agent 1, but Agent 0 needs three items, so allocate to Agent 0.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items 4, 0, 3
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 5

This allocation distributes the items fairly, each agent gets three items, and the distribution is designed to minimize potential envy.

Final JSON format allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
