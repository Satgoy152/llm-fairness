Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  46  28  44  89  56
1  89  92  86  62  54   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 92 86 62 54  8]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they perceive as being at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle. Given the valuations:

Agent 0: [75, 46, 28, 44, 89, 56]  
Agent 1: [89, 92, 86, 62, 54, 8]  

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 75 + 46 + 28 + 44 + 89 + 56 = 338
- Total value for Agent 1: 89 + 92 + 86 + 62 + 54 + 8 = 391

Given this, we aim to divide the items so that each agent perceives their allocation as fair. A common method to ensure envy-freeness is to allocate items by allowing each agent to have items they value the most.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. **Assign the highest-value items for each agent:**
   - For Agent 0, the highest value items in descending order are: Item 4 (89), Item 0 (75), and Item 5 (56).
   - For Agent 1, the highest value items in descending order are: Item 1 (92), Item 2 (86), and Item 3 (62).

2. **Allocate the items:**
   - Agent 0 receives items they value highly: Item 4 and Item 0.
   - Agent 1 receives items they value highly: Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3.
   - The remaining item, Item 5, can be allocated to Agent 0 to balance the number of items, as it is the next highest valued by Agent 0.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 0, and 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, and 3

This allocation results in both agents receiving items they highly value, minimizing envy between them.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
