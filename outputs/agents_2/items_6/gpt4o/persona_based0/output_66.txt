Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  15  51  87  52   5
1  12  86  44  47  57  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent, which can also lead to an envy-free allocation under certain conditions. Here, we have two agents and six items. Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 60
- Item 1: 15
- Item 2: 51
- Item 3: 87
- Item 4: 52
- Item 5: 5

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 12
- Item 1: 86
- Item 2: 44
- Item 3: 47
- Item 4: 57
- Item 5: 12

A simple approach to achieve a fair allocation is to assign items such that each agent receives the items that they value significantly higher than the other agent, while also ensuring that both agents receive an equal number of items (3 items each, since there are 6 items in total).

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Assign items to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (87) compared to Agent 1 who values it at 47.
   - Agent 0 values item 0 (60) higher than Agent 1 who values it at 12.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 (51) higher than Agent 1 who values it at 44.

2. **Assign items to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (86) compared to Agent 0 who values it at 15.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 (57) higher than Agent 0 who values it at 52.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 as Agent 1 does not have more items and Agent 0's valuation for it is only 5, which is not significant compared to others.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items, while ensuring that each agent receives exactly three items. It should minimize envy given the constraints.
