Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  82  26   0  97  97
1  30  58  61  22  68  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness is a situation where no agent would prefer the bundle of items received by another agent based on their own valuations.

Let's consider the valuations given:

- Agent 0's valuations: [50, 82, 26, 0, 97, 97]
- Agent 1's valuations: [30, 58, 61, 22, 68, 47]

To minimize envy and ensure a fair allocation, let's calculate the total value each agent would get from different possible allocations and try to equalize these values as much as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 4**: High value for Agent 0 (97) and also valuable for Agent 1 (68). Allocate to Agent 0 because it maximizes the value for them.

2. **Item 5**: Equal high value for both agents. Allocate to Agent 0 to balance the value distribution from previous allocation.

3. **Item 1**: High value for Agent 0 (82) and significant value for Agent 1 (58). Allocate to Agent 0 to maximize their valuation.

4. **Item 2**: Value for Agent 1 is 61, which is significant. Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 3**: Low value for both. Allocate to Agent 1 to balance the number of items.

6. **Item 0**: Moderate value for Agent 0 (50) and lesser for Agent 1 (30). Allocate to Agent 0.

### Resulting Allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1, 4, 5].
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 3].

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a reasonable share according to their valuations, attempting to minimize envy and achieve a fair division.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
