Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  51  22  46  52  36
1  95  60  60  44  93  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate the items to the agents in such a way that the allocation is fair and envy-free, if possible. In this context, envy-freeness means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocation of the other agent.

Let's start by examining the valuations given by each agent for each item:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 86
  - Item 1: 51
  - Item 2: 22
  - Item 3: 46
  - Item 4: 52
  - Item 5: 36

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 60
  - Item 2: 60
  - Item 3: 44
  - Item 4: 93
  - Item 5: 21

To achieve a fair allocation, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated, while also ensuring that each agent gets 3 items (since there are 6 items and 2 agents).

Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: 86 (highest value for Agent 0)
   - Item 1: 51 (second highest value for Agent 0)
   - Item 5: 36 (next highest value for Agent 0)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 2: 60 (highest value for Agent 1)
   - Item 4: 93 (second highest value for Agent 1)
   - Item 3: 44 (next highest value for Agent 1)

Now let's calculate the total value each agent receives from their allocation:

- Total value for Agent 0: 86 (Item 0) + 51 (Item 1) + 36 (Item 5) = 173
- Total value for Agent 1: 60 (Item 2) + 93 (Item 4) + 44 (Item 3) = 197

Both agents receive a collection of items where their individual valuations total 173 and 197, respectively. This allocation is a fair division based on their preferences, and although it might not be perfectly envy-free (since Agent 0 might envy Agent 1's higher total value), it provides each agent with a significant portion of their preferred items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 3]
}
```
