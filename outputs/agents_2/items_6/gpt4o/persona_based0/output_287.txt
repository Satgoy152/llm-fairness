Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  11  66   9   4  73
1  74  74  63  14  15  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should not prefer the allocation of items given to the other agent over their own allocation. Given the valuations provided, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a bundle of items maximizing their own total value, while ensuring that the allocation remains envy-free.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 73 (item 0) + 11 (item 1) + 66 (item 2) + 9 (item 3) + 4 (item 4) + 73 (item 5) = 236
- Agent 1's total value: 74 (item 0) + 74 (item 1) + 63 (item 2) + 14 (item 3) + 15 (item 4) + 15 (item 5) = 255

To ensure envy-freeness, we can allocate items by considering the highest value each agent has for the items, and distribute them such that both agents receive a fair share based on their preferences.

1. **Agent 0's Top Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 73
   - Item 2: 66
   - Item 5: 73

2. **Agent 1's Top Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 74
   - Item 1: 74
   - Item 2: 63

Now, we will attempt to make allocations that balance the total valuations:

- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values it slightly more than Agent 0 (74 vs. 73).
- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values it significantly more than Agent 0 (74 vs. 11).
- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: Despite Agent 1 having a high value, Agent 0's value is also high, and this helps to balance the allocations.
- **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item highly, more than Agent 1.
- **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item more than Agent 0 (14 vs. 9).
- **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item more than Agent 0 (15 vs. 4).

This gives us the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [2, 5]
- Agent 1 receives items: [0, 1, 3, 4]

The allocations are balanced such that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations and no agent envies the other's allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```
