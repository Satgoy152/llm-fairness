Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  19   4  32  49  46
1  21  63  15  21  79  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [21 63 15 21 79 66]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we need to allocate the items such that each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as they would value every other agent's bundle. Given the valuations, we can attempt to minimize envy by ensuring that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. 

Here's a breakdown of the valuations:

- Agent 0's values: [58, 19, 4, 32, 49, 46]
- Agent 1's values: [21, 63, 15, 21, 79, 66]

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 58 + 19 + 4 + 32 + 49 + 46 = 208
- Total value for Agent 1: 21 + 63 + 15 + 21 + 79 + 66 = 265

Now, we'll allocate items to balance the total value as evenly as possible while ensuring each agent receives a bundle that they value.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Start by allocating the highest valued item for each agent.
2. Proceed to allocate other items to balance the perceived value between agents.

#### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (58), and Agent 1 highly values item 4 (79).
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 and item 4 to Agent 1.

Remaining items: 1, 2, 3, 5

3. Next highest value for Agent 1 is item 5 (66), and for Agent 0 is item 5 (46).
4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

Remaining items: 1, 2, 3

5. Remaining high-value item for Agent 0 is item 3 (32).
6. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

Remaining items: 1, 2

7. Allocate remaining items to balance the value:
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 63 for Agent 1, only 19 for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 4 for Agent 0, 15 for Agent 1).

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 2
- Agent 1 receives items: 4, 5, 1

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives according to their preferences.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 2],
    "1": [4, 5, 1]
}
```
