Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60   3  31  83  47   0
1  52  19  13  18  48  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that neither agent prefers the other's bundle over their own. Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [60, 3, 31, 83, 47, 0]
- Agent 1's valuations: [52, 19, 13, 18, 48, 77]

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Identify high-value items**: 
   - For Agent 0, the highest-valued item is 3 (value = 83).
   - For Agent 1, the highest-valued item is 5 (value = 77).

2. **Create initial allocation based on high-value items**:
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items by considering next highest values and balancing total value**:
   - After assigning high-value items, consider the remaining items and try to balance the total valuation for each agent.
   - Agent 0's remaining items: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]
   - Agent 1's remaining items: [0, 1, 2, 4, 3]

   Let's allocate:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value = 60 for Agent 0 and 52 for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value = 48 for Agent 1 and 47 for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value = 31 for Agent 0 and 13 for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value = 19 for Agent 1 and 3 for Agent 0).

By this allocation, we have:
- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 2, 3
- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 4, 5

Let's check the total valuation for each agent:
- Total valuation for Agent 0 = 60 + 31 + 83 = 174
- Total valuation for Agent 1 = 19 + 48 + 77 = 144

This allocation seems fair as each agent's allocation is based on their own highest preferences, and neither agent envies the other's allocation. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
