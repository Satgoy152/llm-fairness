Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  28  56  25  58  57
1  29  24  68  62  65  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, while also trying to maintain envy-freeness, where no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own bundle.

Let's begin by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [58, 28, 56, 25, 58, 57]
- Agent 1's valuations: [29, 24, 68, 62, 65, 74]

To find an efficient allocation, consider the highest-valued items for each agent. This helps in initializing the allocation process:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5 (74), item 2 (68), and item 4 (65).
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 0 (58), item 4 (58), and item 2 (56).

A suitable approach is to initially allocate the highest-valued items to each agent, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share based on their highest preferences.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 1** as they value it the most.
2. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 1** since it is also one of their highest-valued items.
3. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 1** as they have the highest valuation for it.

Agent 1 now has items [5, 4, 2].

Next, allocate the remaining items to Agent 0:

4. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0** since they have the highest valuation for it.
5. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 0** as it is the remaining item not yet allocated and Agent 0 has no direct competition from Agent 1 for it.
6. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0** as the remaining unallocated item.

Agent 0 now has items [0, 3, 1].

This allocation is based on maximizing the agents' utilities and attempting to minimize envy.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 1],
    "1": [5, 4, 2]
}
```

Each agent receives three items, and the total of 6 items is allocated between the two agents.
