Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  89  39  53  35  73
1  21  53  29  10  82  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim for a division that respects the agents' valuations and seeks to minimize envy. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent feels that they received an adequate share of the items based on their valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 87     | 89     | 39     | 53     | 35     | 73     |
| 1     | 21     | 53     | 29     | 10     | 82     | 14     |

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a method such as the "envy-free matching" approach:

1. **Initial Allocation**: Start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations.
2. **Adjustments**: Make adjustments if necessary to ensure that both agents are satisfied with their allocations.

### Allocation Steps

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 4 and 1.

1. **Assign Item 0**: 
   - Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 0 (87), so assign it to Agent 0.

2. **Assign Item 1**: 
   - Item 1 is highly valued by both agents, but slightly more by Agent 0 (89 vs. 53). Assign it to Agent 0.

3. **Assign Item 4**:
   - Item 4 is highly valued by Agent 1 (82), so assign it to Agent 1.

4. **Assign Item 5**:
   - Item 5 is more highly valued by Agent 0 (73), so assign it to Agent 0.

5. **Assign Item 2**:
   - Item 2 is more highly valued by Agent 0 (39), so assign it to Agent 0.

6. **Assign Item 3**:
   - Assign the remaining item 3 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, aiming to minimize envy by giving each agent the items they value the most.

### JSON Representation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation respects the valuations provided and aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives.
