Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  67  14   7  47  91
1   4  97  11  28  37  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we focus on ensuring that both agents receive allocations that maximize their valuations while considering the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items. The goal is to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of the other agent over their own.

Let's start by reviewing the total valuations for each agent if they were to receive all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 85 + 67 + 14 + 7 + 47 + 91 = 311
- Agent 1's total valuation: 4 + 97 + 11 + 28 + 37 + 94 = 271

Next, we will assign items to each agent in a way that maximizes their individual satisfaction while attempting to balance the total valuations received by both agents.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the most (97), so it's beneficial to allocate it to them.
2. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the most (85), so it's beneficial to allocate it to them.
3. **Assign Item 5 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 5 next highest (94), so allocate it to them.
4. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 4 next highest (47), allocate it to them.
5. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 higher than Agent 0 does (28 vs. 7), so allocate it to them.
6. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**: The remaining item 2 is valued by Agent 0 (14) more than Agent 1 (11), so allocate it to Agent 0.

**Allocation Summary:**

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 4, 2
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 5, 3

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair distribution based on their valuations and that all items are allocated.

**Final Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 2],
    "1": [1, 5, 3]
}
```
