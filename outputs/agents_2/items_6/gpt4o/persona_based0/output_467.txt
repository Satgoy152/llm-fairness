Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  54  55  24  91  91
1  56  92  24  94  22  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [56 92 24 94 22 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can follow an algorithmic approach that aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(14 + 54 + 55 + 24 + 91 + 91 = 329\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(56 + 92 + 24 + 94 + 22 + 84 = 372\)

The goal is to split the items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocated items is balanced.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: 
   - For Agent 0, the highest-valued items are 4 and 5, each valued at 91.
   - For Agent 1, the highest-valued item is item 3, valued at 94.

2. **Initial allocation based on highest values**:
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items to balance total perceived value**:
   - After the initial allocation:
     - Agent 0 has item 4 with a value of 91.
     - Agent 1 has item 3 with a value of 94.

4. **Select additional items to balance the allocation**:
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (Agent 0's value: 91, new total: 182).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (Agent 1's value: 92, new total: 186).

5. **Review remaining items for the fairest allocation**:
   - Remaining items are 0 and 2.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (Agent 0's value: 14, new total: 196).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (Agent 1's value: 24, new total: 210).

### Final Allocation

The final allocation ensures each agent has three items, and the total perceived value for each is roughly balanced:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 5, 0] with a valuation of 196 (91+91+14)
- Agent 1: Items [3, 1, 2] with a valuation of 210 (94+92+24)

These allocations are as follows in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 0],
    "1": [3, 1, 2]
}
```
