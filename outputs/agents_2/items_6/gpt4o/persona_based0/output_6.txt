Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  33  53  56  98  15
1  32   2  56  14  26   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we want to aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle based on their valuations.

Let's summarize the valuations for clarity:

- Agent 0: [36, 33, 53, 56, 98, 15]
- Agent 1: [32, 2, 56, 14, 26, 8]

Total items to allocate: 6

To determine a fair allocation, we can use the following process:

1. Consider the highest-valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible, minimizing envy.

Let's go through the allocations step-by-step:

- Agent 0 highly values item 4 (value 98), followed by item 3 (value 56), and item 2 (value 53).
- Agent 1 highly values item 2 (value 56) and item 0 (value 32).

To minimize envy and balance the allocations, we can allocate as follows:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).
5. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest remaining value for Agent 0).
6. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (next highest remaining value for Agent 1).

The resulting allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 1]

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 98 + 56 + 15 = 169 and Agent 1 a total valuation of 32 + 56 + 2 = 90.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 1]
}
```
