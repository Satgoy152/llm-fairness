Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  26   9  23  28  44
1  90  19  61  38  34   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the method of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This approach helps to ensure that both agents feel they are receiving a fair share based on their valuations.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 32 + 26 + 9 + 23 + 28 + 44 = 162
- Agent 1's total valuation: 90 + 19 + 61 + 38 + 34 + 5 = 247

Next, let's consider potential allocations that aim to balance the perceived value for each agent. We will try to allocate items so that each agent's share is as close to half of their total valuation as possible, without one agent feeling envious of the other.

One possible allocation strategy is as follows:

1. Assign items to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 highly at 44, so assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 values item 0 next at 32, so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 values item 4 next at 28, so assign item 4 to Agent 0.

   This gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 44 + 32 + 28 = 104.

2. Assign items to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 highest at 90, but it is already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value = 61).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value = 38).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value = 19).

   This gives Agent 1 a total valuation of 61 + 38 + 19 = 118.

Let's verify the allocation:

- Items allocated to Agent 0: [5, 0, 4]
  - Total value for Agent 0 = 44 + 32 + 28 = 104
- Items allocated to Agent 1: [2, 3, 1]
  - Total value for Agent 1 = 61 + 38 + 19 = 118

Both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations, and no agent envies the other's allocation. The allocation ensures that each agent has a perception of a fair division based on their own valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 1]
}
```
