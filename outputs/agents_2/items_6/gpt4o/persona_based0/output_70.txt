Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68   4  96  35  97  59
1  57  81  61  92   4  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. The goal is to allocate all 6 items such that each agent perceives their allocation to be at least as valuable as the other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [68, 4, 96, 35, 97, 59]
- Agent 1: [57, 81, 61, 92, 4, 88]

We need to allocate these items in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuation.

Let's consider the following steps for allocation:

1. **Find the total valuation for each agent across all items:**
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 68 + 4 + 96 + 35 + 97 + 59 = 359
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 57 + 81 + 61 + 92 + 4 + 88 = 383

2. **Allocate items based on maximizing each agent's perceived value:**
   - Allocate items to ensure each agent's allocation is the largest possible based on their individual valuations.

3. **Assign items to ensure fairness:**
   - We aim to ensure that the perceived value of each agent's allocation is as balanced as possible, given the constraints of integer item allocations.

Based on the given valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items 0, 2, 4 (valuations: 68, 96, 97)
  - Total value for Agent 0: 68 + 96 + 97 = 261

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items 1, 3, 5 (valuations: 81, 92, 88)
  - Total value for Agent 1: 81 + 92 + 88 = 261

Both agents receive allocations that they value equally, thereby achieving an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
