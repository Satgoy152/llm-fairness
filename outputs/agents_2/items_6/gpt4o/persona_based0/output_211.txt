Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  60  56  16  61  47
1   9  14   0  22  59  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim to minimize envy and balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 26 + 60 + 56 + 16 + 61 + 47 = 266
   - Agent 1: 9 + 14 + 0 + 22 + 59 + 92 = 196

2. **Identify High Valuations**: 
   - Items where each agent has high valuation relative to the other:
     - Agent 0 values items 0 (26), 1 (60), 2 (56), 4 (61)
     - Agent 1 values items 5 (92), 4 (59)

3. **Initial Allocation**: 
   - Allocate the items where each agent has a significantly higher valuation than the other.
     - Agent 0: Allocate items 1 and 2 since these have high values (60, 56).
     - Agent 1: Allocate item 5 as the highest valued item (92).

4. **Balance the Remaining Items**:
   - Remaining items: 0, 3, 4
   - Allocate based on current balance to minimize envy and ensure both agents get a fair total value.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 since Agent 1 already got a high-value item (5).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 to balance the values further.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 to ensure all items are distributed.

6. **Valuations After Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 4, 0] with total value 60 + 56 + 61 + 26 = 203
   - Agent 1: Items [5, 3] with total value 92 + 22 = 114

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences while minimizing potential envy.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 5]
}
```

This setup ensures all items are allocated and that each agent receives an integer number of items.
