Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  71  23  52  12   3
1  25  19  67  36  70  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy between them. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of the other agent, according to their own valuations. 

To start, let's examine the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 11 + 71 + 23 + 52 + 12 + 3 = 172
- Agent 1's total valuation: 25 + 19 + 67 + 36 + 70 + 86 = 303

Agent 1 has a higher total valuation, so we might expect that they should receive items with higher individual values to balance out the perceived value between the two agents.

We can aim to allocate the items in such a way that each agent gets a near-equal share of their respective total valuation:

1. Start by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent based on their individual valuations, while balancing the total value received by each agent.

2. For Agent 0, the highest valued item is item 1 (71), followed by item 3 (52).

3. For Agent 1, the highest valued item is item 5 (86), followed by item 4 (70).

Now, let's assign items while keeping fairness in mind:

- Agent 0 should receive items 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 should receive items 0, 4, and 5.

Let's validate the allocations:

- Agent 0's allocation: Items [1, 2, 3]
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 71 (item 1) + 23 (item 2) + 52 (item 3) = 146

- Agent 1's allocation: Items [0, 4, 5]
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 25 (item 0) + 70 (item 4) + 86 (item 5) = 181

This allocation is close to the perceived value between the two agents, considering their total valuations of all items. The difference in total valuations between the two allocations is minimized, and each agent receives a fair share relative to their total valuation of the items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
