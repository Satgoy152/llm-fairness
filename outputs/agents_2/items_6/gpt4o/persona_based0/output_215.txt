Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  92  52  43   0  88
1  64  12  30  91  81  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents so that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We should aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as the other agent, according to their own valuations.

Here are the valuations again for clarity:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 45
  - Item 1: 92
  - Item 2: 52
  - Item 3: 43
  - Item 4: 0
  - Item 5: 88

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 12
  - Item 2: 30
  - Item 3: 91
  - Item 4: 81
  - Item 5: 49

A good strategy is to allocate items that each agent values highly while ensuring the total value perceived by each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's calculate and propose an allocation:

1. **Agent 0's highest values:**
   - Item 1: 92
   - Item 5: 88

2. **Agent 1's highest values:**
   - Item 3: 91
   - Item 4: 81

Now, let's balance the remaining items:

3. **Remaining items and their values:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 (45), Agent 1 (64)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (52), Agent 1 (30)

Based on this, we propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 1 (92)
  - Item 5 (88)
  - Item 2 (52)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 3 (91)
  - Item 4 (81)
  - Item 0 (64)

This allocation ensures both agents receive items they highly value, and the total perceived value is balanced:

- Total value for Agent 0: 92 + 88 + 52 = 232
- Total value for Agent 1: 91 + 81 + 64 = 236

Both agents have high total valuations, and the distribution is reasonably fair. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 0]
}
```
