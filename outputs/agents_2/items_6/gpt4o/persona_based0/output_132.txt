Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  26  56  95  58  15
1  19  61  60  33  61  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the total value according to their own valuations.

We have 2 agents and 6 items. Let's first compute the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 42 + 26 + 56 + 95 + 58 + 15 = 292
- Agent 1's total valuation: 19 + 61 + 60 + 33 + 61 + 32 = 266

Next, we'll aim to divide the items such that the perceived value by each agent is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highly (95).
   - Agent 1 values items 1 and 4 highly (61 each).

2. **Initial allocations based on highest value items:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign items 1 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items to balance perceived total value:**
   - Remaining items are: 0, 2, 5.
   - Agent 0 can be allocated item 2 (56) to increase their perceived value.
   - Agent 1 can take item 0 (19) to provide them with another item.
   - Finally, item 5, which is of relatively low value to both agents, can be allocated to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation

Now, let's calculate the perceived total value after this allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 3, 2
  - Value: 95 + 56 = 151

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 1, 4, 0, 5
  - Value: 61 + 61 + 19 + 32 = 173

This allocation ensures that both agents have a set of items they value, with Agent 1 having a slightly higher total value, but with more items. This allocation aims to balance the total perceived value as much as possible while ensuring each agent feels they have received valuable items according to their own valuations.

### Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1, 4, 0, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 6 items between the two agents, ensuring that no items are left unallocated.
