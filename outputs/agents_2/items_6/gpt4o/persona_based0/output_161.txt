Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  75   9  33  62  29
1  55   0  85  54  44  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that considers envy-freeness, we aim to allocate items such that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their own valuations. Given the table of valuations, we should consider both maximizing the total value each agent receives and ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation based on their own valuations.

Here is the table of valuations for clarity:

| Agent/Item |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |
|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 0          | 62  | 75  |  9  | 33  | 62  | 29  |
| 1          | 55  |  0  | 85  | 54  | 44  | 26  |

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**  
   - Prioritizes items: 1 (75), 0 (62), 4 (62), 3 (33), 5 (29), 2 (9)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**  
   - Prioritizes items: 2 (85), 3 (54), 0 (55), 4 (44), 5 (26), 1 (0)

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items that maximize their valuation while considering availability and minimizing envy from Agent 1.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items that maximize their valuation while considering availability and minimizing envy from Agent 0.

#### Allocation Steps:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (remaining item).

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 0, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a set of items which they highly value relative to the other available items, minimizing the potential for envy based on their own valuations.
