Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8  98  80  63  21  18
1  28  67  66  81   1  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-free means that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

First, let's compute the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 8 + 98 + 80 + 63 + 21 + 18 = 288
- Agent 1's total valuation: 28 + 67 + 66 + 81 + 1 + 59 = 302

Next, let's allocate the items in a way that considers the agents' valuations to minimize envy.

1. Consider each agent's highest valued items and try to allocate those in a way that balances the total value received by each agent.

2. Agent 0 values item 1 (98) the most, and agent 1 values item 3 (81) the most. Allocate these items to their respective agents: Agent 0 gets item 1, and Agent 1 gets item 3.

3. Next highest valued items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (80)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (67), but already allocated; next is Item 2 (66)

4. Allocate items to balance total values received:
   - Give item 2 to agent 0, as they value it slightly more (80 vs. 66).

Next, distribute remaining items:

5. Remaining items are 0, 4, and 5.
   - Agent 0: Highest remaining value is for item 0 (8).
   - Agent 1: Highest remaining values are for item 5 (59) and item 4 (1).

6. Allocate item 0 to agent 0 and items 4 and 5 to agent 1.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, and 0
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, and 5

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations and keep envy to a minimum, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 0],
    "1": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
