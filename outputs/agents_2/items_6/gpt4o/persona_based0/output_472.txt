Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  54  94  48  91  37
1  10   2  33  42  77  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to it as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 58  
  - Item 1: 54  
  - Item 2: 94  
  - Item 3: 48  
  - Item 4: 91  
  - Item 5: 37  

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 10  
  - Item 1: 2  
  - Item 2: 33  
  - Item 3: 42  
  - Item 4: 77  
  - Item 5: 71  

### Approach to Allocation:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this the highest at 94, while Agent 1 values it at 33. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
   
2. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values this at 91, while Agent 1 values it at 77. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values this the highest at 71, compared to Agent 0's valuation of 37. Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this at 42, while Agent 0 values it at 48. Since Agent 1 has been given only one item so far, assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this at 58, while Agent 1 values it at 10. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

6. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this at 54, while Agent 1 values it at 2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations and the total number of items they receive.

### Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 5]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 4, while Agent 1 receives items 3 and 5. This allocation attempts to minimize envy by considering both agents' valuations.
