Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  55  60  46  59  78
1  57   5  12  29  80  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57  5 12 29 80 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to any other agent based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [37, 55, 60, 46, 59, 78]
Agent 1: [57, 5, 12, 29, 80, 98]
```

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0's total valuation for all items**: 37 + 55 + 60 + 46 + 59 + 78 = 335
2. **Agent 1's total valuation for all items**: 57 + 5 + 12 + 29 + 80 + 98 = 281

To approach envy-freeness, we should consider allocating items such that each agent gets a reasonable share of their total valuation.

### Allocation Strategy

- **Agent 0** heavily values items 5 (78), 2 (60), and 4 (59).
- **Agent 1** heavily values items 5 (98), 4 (80), and 0 (57).

Let's try to balance the allocations:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 because it has the highest value for them (98), significantly more than Agent 0's valuation (78).
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 because it also has a high value for them (80), slightly more than Agent 0's value (59).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 because it has a high value for them (60), significantly more than Agent 1's value (12).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 because it has a higher value for them (46) than it does for Agent 1 (29).
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 because it has a higher value for them (57) than it does for Agent 0 (37).
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 because it is the only item left, and Agent 0 values it more (55) than Agent 1 (5).

### Final Allocation

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 2, 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 4, 5

This allocation considers the valuations and attempts to minimize envy:

- Agent 0 receives a bundle valued at 55 + 60 + 46 = 161.
- Agent 1 receives a bundle valued at 57 + 80 + 98 = 235.

Agent 0 may envy Agent 1 slightly due to the higher total valuation, but given the constraints and differences in individual item valuations, this allocation provides a reasonable balance.

### Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 5]
}
