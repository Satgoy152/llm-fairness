Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  38  64  94  92  14
1  36  43  39  78  26  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share considering their own valuations. Since there are only two agents, we can use a simple method to attempt an envy-free allocation based on maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring each gets three items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to each potential bundle of three items, and then make a selection that maximizes each agent's satisfaction.

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Items 0, 1, 2: 66 + 38 + 64 = 168  
- Items 0, 1, 3: 66 + 38 + 94 = 198  
- Items 0, 1, 4: 66 + 38 + 92 = 196  
- Items 0, 1, 5: 66 + 38 + 14 = 118  
- Items 0, 2, 3: 66 + 64 + 94 = 224  
- Items 0, 2, 4: 66 + 64 + 92 = 222  
- Items 0, 2, 5: 66 + 64 + 14 = 144  
- Items 0, 3, 4: 66 + 94 + 92 = 252  
- Items 0, 3, 5: 66 + 94 + 14 = 174  
- Items 0, 4, 5: 66 + 92 + 14 = 172  
- Items 1, 2, 3: 38 + 64 + 94 = 196  
- Items 1, 2, 4: 38 + 64 + 92 = 194  
- Items 1, 2, 5: 38 + 64 + 14 = 116  
- Items 1, 3, 4: 38 + 94 + 92 = 224  
- Items 1, 3, 5: 38 + 94 + 14 = 146  
- Items 1, 4, 5: 38 + 92 + 14 = 144  
- Items 2, 3, 4: 64 + 94 + 92 = 250  
- Items 2, 3, 5: 64 + 94 + 14 = 172  
- Items 2, 4, 5: 64 + 92 + 14 = 170  
- Items 3, 4, 5: 94 + 92 + 14 = 200  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Items 0, 1, 2: 36 + 43 + 39 = 118  
- Items 0, 1, 3: 36 + 43 + 78 = 157  
- Items 0, 1, 4: 36 + 43 + 26 = 105  
- Items 0, 1, 5: 36 + 43 + 36 = 115  
- Items 0, 2, 3: 36 + 39 + 78 = 153  
- Items 0, 2, 4: 36 + 39 + 26 = 101  
- Items 0, 2, 5: 36 + 39 + 36 = 111  
- Items 0, 3, 4: 36 + 78 + 26 = 140  
- Items 0, 3, 5: 36 + 78 + 36 = 150  
- Items 0, 4, 5: 36 + 26 + 36 = 98  
- Items 1, 2, 3: 43 + 39 + 78 = 160  
- Items 1, 2, 4: 43 + 39 + 26 = 108  
- Items 1, 2, 5: 43 + 39 + 36 = 118  
- Items 1, 3, 4: 43 + 78 + 26 = 147  
- Items 1, 3, 5: 43 + 78 + 36 = 157  
- Items 1, 4, 5: 43 + 26 + 36 = 105  
- Items 2, 3, 4: 39 + 78 + 26 = 143  
- Items 2, 3, 5: 39 + 78 + 36 = 153  
- Items 2, 4, 5: 39 + 26 + 36 = 101  
- Items 3, 4, 5: 78 + 26 + 36 = 140  

By looking at these, we find that Agent 0 values the bundle {0, 3, 4} the most (value 252), and Agent 1 values the bundle {1, 3, 5} the most (value 157). However, these allocations overlap on item 3, so we need to adjust to avoid conflict.

Let's try allocating:
- Agent 0: Items {0, 2, 4} (value 222 for Agent 0)
- Agent 1: Items {1, 3, 5} (value 157 for Agent 1)

This allocation resolves item 3 conflict and gives each agent a high total value. 

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
