Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  29  95  70  34  59
1  96  44  56  58  22  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [96 44 56 58 22 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1) according to their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 41 + 29 + 95 + 70 + 34 + 59 = 328
- Agent 1: 96 + 44 + 56 + 58 + 22 + 77 = 353

Next, we should consider the values each agent places on individual items to determine a fair allocation. We will aim for both agents to be satisfied with their allocations relative to their valuations.

### Allocation Strategy
We look for a fair division by considering the high-value items for each agent and balancing the total value they receive.

1. **Agent 0's Priorities**:
   - Highest valued items: Item 2 (95), Item 3 (70), Item 5 (59)

2. **Agent 1's Priorities**:
   - Highest valued items: Item 0 (96), Item 5 (77), Item 3 (58)

### Initial Allocation
1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (as it is the second-highest valued item for Agent 1 and third for Agent 0).
4. Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (balancing since Agent 0 had no high-value item after Item 2).
5. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
6. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (as it has relatively low value for both, but slightly higher for Agent 1).

### Resulting Allocation
- Agent 0: Items 2, 5, 1
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 4

Now let's calculate the total value each agent receives:
- **Agent 0**: 95 (Item 2) + 59 (Item 5) + 29 (Item 1) = 183
- **Agent 1**: 96 (Item 0) + 58 (Item 3) + 22 (Item 4) = 176

This allocation provides a reasonable balance given the preferences, ensuring that both agents receive a fair share according to their valuations.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 1],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
