Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  85  90  18  63   0
1  93  35  88  50  20  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 35 88 50 20 88]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to achieve a division where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [66, 85, 90, 18, 63, 0]
- Agent 1: [93, 35, 88, 50, 20, 88]

Let's try to allocate the items such that both agents receive a fair share according to their preferences.

1. **Item 0**: Valued higher by Agent 1 (93 vs. 66).
2. **Item 1**: Valued higher by Agent 0 (85 vs. 35).
3. **Item 2**: Valued higher by Agent 0 (90 vs. 88).
4. **Item 3**: Valued higher by Agent 1 (50 vs. 18).
5. **Item 4**: Valued higher by Agent 0 (63 vs. 20).
6. **Item 5**: Valued higher by Agent 1 (88 vs. 0).

Based on these valuations, we can attempt the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, and 4 (valued at 85, 90, and 63 respectively for a total of 238).
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, and 5 (valued at 93, 50, and 88 respectively for a total of 231).

These allocations provide a relatively balanced distribution of total valuation (238 for Agent 0 and 231 for Agent 1), achieving a fair division.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
