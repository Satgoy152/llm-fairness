Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2  3   4   5
0  15  40  38  7  71  73
1  14  90  58  7  15  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here are the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [15, 40, 38, 7, 71, 73]
- Agent 1: [14, 90, 58, 7, 15, 77]

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:**
   - Agent 0: 15 + 40 + 38 + 7 + 71 + 73 = 244
   - Agent 1: 14 + 90 + 58 + 7 + 15 + 77 = 261

2. **Allocate items to balance the perceived value:**
   - We want the allocation to be as balanced as possible in terms of the total value perceived by each agent.

3. **Create the allocation:**

- Agent 0 could receive items that they value relatively highly compared to Agent 1, trying to balance the total values:
  - Agent 0: Items 4 and 5 (values 71 and 73 for Agent 0, 15 and 77 for Agent 1)
  
- Agent 1 receives the remaining items, which they value more highly than Agent 0:
  - Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2, and 3 (values 14, 90, 58, and 7 for Agent 1, 15, 40, 38, and 7 for Agent 0)

The allocations ensure both agents feel they received a fair share based on their own valuations, reducing envy. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation distributes all items and respects the envy-free condition as closely as possible given the agents' valuations.
