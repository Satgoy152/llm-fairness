Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  19   5  18  60  52
1  91  17  92  21  13  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy, we can utilize the concept of maximizing the Nash welfare, which is the product of the utilities each agent derives from their allocation. Given the valuations, we'll try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences.

Here are the steps to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:**

   - Agent 0's total valuation: 19 + 19 + 5 + 18 + 60 + 52 = 173
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 91 + 17 + 92 + 21 + 13 + 76 = 310

2. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**

   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most (60), followed by item 5 (52).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (92), followed by item 0 (91).

3. **Allocate items based on maximizing utility:**

   - Start with allocating high-value items to each agent based on their preferences:
     - Allocate item 4 and item 5 to Agent 0.
     - Allocate item 2 and item 0 to Agent 1.

4. **Distribute remaining items:**

   - Remaining items are 1 and 3.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 (19) and item 3 (18) equally, and Agent 1 values item 3 (21) slightly more than item 1 (17).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 and item 1 to Agent 0 to balance the allocation.

This allocation balances the high-value items between the agents and considers their preferences for remaining items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
