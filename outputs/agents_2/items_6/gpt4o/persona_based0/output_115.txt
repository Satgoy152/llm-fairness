Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4  5
0  22  50  56  60  30  2
1  59   5  86  39  83  3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the division is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the discrete nature of the problem. Each agent should receive a set of items such that they value their allocation at least as much or more than the other agent's allocation.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [22, 50, 56, 60, 30, 2]
- Agent 1 values: [59, 5, 86, 39, 83, 3]

We'll try to allocate the items so that each agent feels their allocation is fair.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Prefers items with higher valuations for them. Items 3 and 2 are highly valued.
   - Allocating items 3 (value 60) and 2 (value 56) gives a total value of 116.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Prefers items with higher valuations for them. Items 2, 4, and 0 are highly valued.
   - Since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, allocating items 4 (value 83) and 0 (value 59) gives a total value of 142.
   - Additionally, we consider items 1 (value 5) and 5 (value 3) for a total of 150.

Now, let's make sure the allocation is fair and complete:

- Agent 0 has items [3, 2] with a total value of 116.
- Agent 1 has items [0, 4, 1, 5] with a total value of 150.

This allocation ensures that every item is allocated, and both agents have a reasonable share according to their valuations. Agent 0 may have a lower total value, but their highest-valued items are respected, which can be seen as an envy-free consideration.

Here's the allocation in the required format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5]
}
```
