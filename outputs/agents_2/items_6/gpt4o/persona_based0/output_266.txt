Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  75  11  23  53  51
1   7  68  89  90  24  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. Here, we aim to allocate all 6 items to the two agents based on their valuations.

Let's compute the total valuations each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 63 + 75 + 11 + 23 + 53 + 51 = 276
- Agent 1's total valuation: 7 + 68 + 89 + 90 + 24 + 67 = 345

With these valuations in mind, we will attempt to allocate the items to the agents to minimize envy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:**
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 90 and item 2 at 89.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most at 75 and item 0 at 63.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on High Valuations:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

3. **Consider Remaining Items (4 and 5):**
   - Agent 1 has a higher valuation for item 5 (67) than Agent 0 (51).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 has a higher valuation (53) than Agent 1 (24).

Let's now verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0's Allocated Items:** 0, 1, 4
- **Agent 1's Allocated Items:** 2, 3, 5

Agent 0's total valuation for their allocated items: 63 + 75 + 53 = 191

Agent 1's total valuation for their allocated items: 89 + 90 + 67 = 246

These allocations attempt to balance the total valuations while ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocated items significantly.

**Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
