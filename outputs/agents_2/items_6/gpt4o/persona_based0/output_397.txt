Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  78  22  28  89  65
1   4  42  40  65  26  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[52 78 22 28 89 65]
 [ 4 42 40 65 26 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation means each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as they value the bundle of any other agent.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [52, 78, 22, 28, 89, 65]
- Agent 1: [4, 42, 40, 65, 26, 62]

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 89.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 65.

2. **Allocate High-Value Items:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Balance Remaining Items:**
   - We need to ensure each agent is satisfied with their allocation compared to what the other agent receives. 

4. **Fair Allocation:**
   - After allocating the highest valued items, we allocate the remaining items to balance the perceived value for each agent.

Considering the above steps, here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 0, 1, 4
  - Total Valuation: 52 + 78 + 89 = 219

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 2, 3, 5
  - Total Valuation: 40 + 65 + 62 = 167

This allocation ensures that Agent 0, who places very high value on item 4, receives it, and Agent 1, who values item 3 the highest, receives it. The allocation is balanced by distributing the other items to ensure no agent envies the other's allocation.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This solution ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while maintaining an integer allocation of items.
