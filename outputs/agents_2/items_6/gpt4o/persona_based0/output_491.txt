Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85   5  49  84  80  73
1  98  51   1  59  30  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, while also maintaining a balance to minimize envy. Given the valuations matrix, we can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate the Total Value for Each Agent**: Sum up the values for each agent across all items.
   - Agent 0: 85 + 5 + 49 + 84 + 80 + 73 = 376
   - Agent 1: 98 + 51 + 1 + 59 + 30 + 29 = 268

2. **Greedy Allocation Based on Maximum Valuation**:
   - We will iteratively assign the item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 98, higher than Agent 0's 85.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 51, higher than Agent 0's 5.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 49, higher than Agent 1's 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 84, higher than Agent 1's 59.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 80, higher than Agent 1's 30.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 73, higher than Agent 1's 29.

4. **Sum of Items Allocated**:
   - Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 4, 5]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 1]

5. **Check and Adjust for Fairness**:
   - Agent 0 receives items valued at: 49 + 84 + 80 + 73 = 286.
   - Agent 1 receives items valued at: 98 + 51 = 149.
   - This allocation minimizes envy given the constraints of integer item assignments.

Given this allocation, here is the JSON format for the solution:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
