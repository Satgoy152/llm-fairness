Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  57  14  43   5  18
1  47  77  52  34  75  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair, given their own valuations. Note that an exact envy-free allocation might not always be possible, but we can strive for an allocation that minimizes envy.

Here's the valuation table again for reference:

```
Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  
-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----
0          | 76 | 57 | 14 | 43 | 5  | 18 
1          | 47 | 77 | 52 | 34 | 75 | 66 
```

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 76.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 77.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Values:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Consider Remaining Items:**
   - For Agent 0, the remaining high-value items are: item 1 (57), item 3 (43).
   - For Agent 1, the remaining high-value items are: item 4 (75), item 5 (66).

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest value after item 0 for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 4 and item 5 to Agent 1 (high values for Agent 1).

5. **Final Allocation Check:**
   - Agent 0 has items: 0, 3
   - Agent 1 has items: 1, 4, 5
   - Item 2 remains unassigned, back to Agent 0 due to lower aggregate value for Agent 1.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the total perceived value each agent receives while minimizing potential envy.
