Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  37  51  17  70  81
1  73  35  30  62  37  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem with two agents, we need to allocate the items such that both agents feel they have a fair share, ideally achieving an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 58
- Item 1: 37
- Item 2: 51
- Item 3: 17
- Item 4: 70
- Item 5: 81

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 73
- Item 1: 35
- Item 2: 30
- Item 3: 62
- Item 4: 37
- Item 5: 48

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring no agent prefers another's allocation. This can be done using a greedy algorithm or by considering the maximin share guarantee, although with only two agents, an intuitive balance is often achievable.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Allocate high-value items to each agent based on their preferences:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 5 (81) and item 4 (70).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0 (73) and item 3 (62).

2. **Distribute remaining items:**
   - Balance the distribution by ensuring the sum of valuations for each agent is as close as possible.
   - Consider remaining items 1 and 2 for allocation.

Let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 4: Value 70
  - Item 5: Value 81
  - Total value for agent 0: 151

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: Value 73
  - Item 3: Value 62
  - Total value for agent 1: 135

Now allocate the remaining items 1 and 2:

- Agent 0:
  - Add item 2: Value 51
  - New total value for agent 0: 202

- Agent 1:
  - Add item 1: Value 35
  - New total value for agent 1: 170

This allocation ensures both agents receive at least some of their most valued items and the total values are reasonably balanced.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total perceived value each agent receives, considering their individual valuations.
