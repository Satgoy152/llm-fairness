Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  73  13  67   5  97
1  90   0  49  59  40  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly between the two agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items and the allocation is envy-free, we should look for a distribution of items that maximizes each agent's valuation of the items they receive relative to the others.

One method to achieve an envy-free allocation is to ensure that each agent receives the items they value the most, wherever possible, while maintaining a fair distribution of total value. We can start by reviewing the valuations and trying to distribute the items to balance the perceived value between the two agents.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 49
  - Item 1: 73
  - Item 2: 13
  - Item 3: 67
  - Item 4: 5
  - Item 5: 97

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 49
  - Item 3: 59
  - Item 4: 40
  - Item 5: 86

To create a fair allocation, we can proceed as follows:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 because it has the highest value for Agent 0 (97) and also a high value for Agent 1 (86).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 because it has the highest value for Agent 1 (90).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 because it has a significant value for Agent 0 (73) while having no value for Agent 1 (0).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 because it has a reasonably high value for Agent 1 (59) compared to Agent 0 (67).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because it gives Agent 1 a moderately high value (49) and also balances the total number of items.
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because it has a minimal value for both agents, but it helps balance the number of items.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share in terms of perceived value and item count, minimizing envy.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
