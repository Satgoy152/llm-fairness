Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0  1   2   3   4   5
0  16  6  23  77  50  53
1  72  3  39  94  78  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free, or at least as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and then consider strategies to split the items such that each agent's perceived value of their set is maximized under the constraint of integer assignments.

### Agent Valuations:

**Agent 0:**
- Item 0: 16
- Item 1: 6
- Item 2: 23
- Item 3: 77
- Item 4: 50
- Item 5: 53

Total Valuation for Agent 0 = 16 + 6 + 23 + 77 + 50 + 53 = 225

**Agent 1:**
- Item 0: 72
- Item 1: 3
- Item 2: 39
- Item 3: 94
- Item 4: 78
- Item 5: 95

Total Valuation for Agent 1 = 72 + 3 + 39 + 94 + 78 + 95 = 381

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **High-Valuation Items:**
   - Identify items that have much higher valuations for one agent over the other. Items 3 (94 vs. 77) and 5 (95 vs. 53) are more valuable to Agent 1.
   - Allocate items 3 and 5 to Agent 1.

2. **Balance Remaining Items:**
   - After allocating items 3 and 5 to Agent 1, consider the remaining items: 0, 1, 2, 4.
   - Agent 1 has a strong preference for item 0 (72 vs. 16), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate the remaining items (1, 2, and 4) to Agent 0 to maximize their total value.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 2, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 3, 5

This allocation aims to minimize envy by assigning items based on stronger preferences while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
