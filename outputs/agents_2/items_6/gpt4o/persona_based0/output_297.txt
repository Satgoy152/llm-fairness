Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  72  92  21  51  14
1   1  58  37  98  73  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to satisfy the condition of envy-freeness as closely as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel they have received at least as much value as the other agent in terms of their own valuation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0** values:  
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 92
  - Item 3: 21
  - Item 4: 51
  - Item 5: 14

- **Agent 1** values:
  - Item 0: 1
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 37
  - Item 3: 98
  - Item 4: 73
  - Item 5: 92

To achieve a fair allocation, we will look to maximize each agent's total value for the items they receive, while ensuring no envy.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Prioritize high-value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items 2, 0, and 1 the most.
   - Agent 1 values items 3, 5, and 4 the most.

2. **Allocate items to maximize total perceived value for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets 3 items:**

- Assign Agent 0 their top three valued items: items 2, 0, and 1.
- Assign Agent 1 their top three valued items: items 3, 5, and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value the most, reducing potential envy.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 92 + 79 + 72 = 243 and Agent 1 a total value of 98 + 73 + 92 = 263, based on their own valuations. Each agent receives three items, and the allocation is envy-free because each agent receives their top valued items.
