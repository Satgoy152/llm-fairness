Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  99  53  78  85  56
1  79  54  54  36  97  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute them in a way that maximizes their perceived value and minimizes envy. One possible approach is to use the "divide and choose" method or to iteratively adjust allocations to balance valuations. Let's evaluate a possible allocation:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items for Agent 0: Item 1 (99), Item 4 (85), and Item 3 (78).
   - Allocate these items to Agent 0: [1, 4, 3].

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items for Agent 1: Item 4 (97), Item 0 (79), and Item 5 (56).
   - Since Item 4 is already allocated to Agent 0, choose the next highest valued items for Agent 1: Item 0 (79), Item 2 (54), and Item 5 (56).
   - Allocate these items to Agent 1: [0, 2, 5].

### Resulting Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** [1, 4, 3]
- **Agent 1:** [0, 2, 5]

### Verification:

- **Agent 0's Total Valuation:**
  - Item 1: 99
  - Item 4: 85
  - Item 3: 78
  - Total: 262

- **Agent 1's Total Valuation:**
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 2: 54
  - Item 5: 56
  - Total: 189

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. The allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives, aiming for an envy-free result given the constraints.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
