Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  62  51  17  31  58
1  60  50  78  22  26  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly, we'll aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible, ensuring that each agent values their allocated items at least as much as they value the items allocated to the other agent. Given the constraints, we will allocate 3 items to each agent.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [62, 62, 51, 17, 31, 58]
- Agent 1: [60, 50, 78, 22, 26, 90]

We will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their respective allocations while maintaining a fair division.

**Step 1: Identify high-value items for each agent.**

- Agent 0's highest values: 62 (items 0 and 1)
- Agent 1's highest values: 90 (item 5), 78 (item 2)

**Step 2: Allocate high-value items to each agent.**

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

**Step 3: Allocate remaining items to maximize value and maintain fairness.**

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 to keep their high-value item.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 as it's their second-highest value.

**Step 4: Allocate the remaining items to balance the total value.**

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

Now let's check the total value for each agent:

- Agent 0: 62 (item 0) + 62 (item 1) + 31 (item 4) = 155
- Agent 1: 90 (item 5) + 78 (item 2) + 22 (item 3) = 190

Both agents receive a similar number of high-value items, and the allocation is balanced given the constraints.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
