Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  55  11  21  29  82
1  25  42  95   7  72  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation, as much as possible. This is generally approached by attempting to maximize each agent's perceived value of their own allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [0, 55, 11, 21, 29, 82]
- Agent 1's valuations: [25, 42, 95, 7, 72, 34]

We will try to allocate the items such that each agent gets a bundle they value highly.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most (82).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (95).

2. **Allocate the highest valued items:**
   - Give item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Give item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items by considering next highest values:**
   - Agent 0 now has item 5. Next highest values are 1 (55) and 4 (29).
   - Agent 1 now has item 2. Next highest values are 4 (72) and 1 (42).

4. **Allocation for remaining items:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 1 (55) as it is the next highest valued item.
   - Agent 1 gets item 4 (72) as it is the next highest valued item after item 2.

5. **Allocate the remaining items (0 and 3):**
   - Agent 0 has a preference for item 3 (21) over item 0 (0).
   - Agent 1 has a preference for item 3 (7) over item 0 (25).

   To keep balance and minimize envy:
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

The allocation minimizes potential envy and maximizes the perceived values for each agent, given the constraints.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This distribution gives each agent a collection of items they value highly, attempting to keep the allocation fair and nearly envy-free under the given circumstances.
