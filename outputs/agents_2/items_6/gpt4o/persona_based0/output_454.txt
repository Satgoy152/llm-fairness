Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  15  91   5  70  11
1  12  36  83  42  62  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by both agents. Our aim is to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

To achieve this, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, while minimizing any potential envy. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent places on all items**:
   - Agent 0: \( 5 + 15 + 91 + 5 + 70 + 11 = 197 \)
   - Agent 1: \( 12 + 36 + 83 + 42 + 62 + 79 = 314 \)

2. **Evaluate the items based on relative preference**:
   - Compare the relative value each agent places on each item and try to allocate items where the disparity is greatest in favor of the agent receiving the item.

3. **Allocate items to minimize envy**:
   - Agent 0 prefers item 2 (value of 91) and item 4 (value of 70) strongly compared to Agent 1's valuation.
   - Agent 1 prefers item 5 (value of 79) and item 3 (value of 42) strongly compared to Agent 0's valuation.

Using this strategy, we can propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Items: 0 (5), 2 (91), 4 (70)
  - Total value = 166

- **Agent 1**:
  - Items: 1 (36), 3 (42), 5 (79)
  - Total value = 157

This allocation considers the strong preferences of each agent for certain items and attempts to balance the allocation such that each agent receives items they value highly, thereby minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive three items each, and the total number of items allocated remains six.
