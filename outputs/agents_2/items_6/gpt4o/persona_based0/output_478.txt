Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  13  44  89   1  79
1  65  96   4  37  87  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 1 13 44 89  1 79]
 [65 96  4 37 87 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that neither of the agents envies the other's allocation more than their own. This is a simplified version of achieving an envy-free allocation.

First, let's analyze the valuation table:

```
Agent 0: [1, 13, 44, 89, 1, 79]
Agent 1: [65, 96, 4, 37, 87, 35]
```

Our goal is to allocate these items such that the total value for each agent is roughly balanced and neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Prefers item 3 (value 89), item 5 (value 79), and item 2 (value 44).
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Prefers item 1 (value 96), item 4 (value 87), and item 0 (value 65).

Let's assign the items accordingly:

- Assign items 3, 5, and 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 4, and 0 to Agent 1.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 2],
    "1": [1, 4, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives three items, and attempts to balance the total perceived value of the items each agent receives. Both agents end up with items they highly value, reducing the likelihood of envy.
