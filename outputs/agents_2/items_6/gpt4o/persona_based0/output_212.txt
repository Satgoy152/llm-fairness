Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  78  45   4  58  39
1  55  91  85  91  57  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is also envy-free, we should try to allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their individual valuations while ensuring that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation. Given the valuations of the two agents for the six items, we can proceed by analyzing the values and attempting to balance the allocation.

### Valuations Table:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 70
  - Item 1: 78
  - Item 2: 45
  - Item 3: 4
  - Item 4: 58
  - Item 5: 39

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 85
  - Item 3: 91
  - Item 4: 57
  - Item 5: 11

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 highly (78).
   - Agent 1 values both Item 1 (91) and Item 3 (91) highly.

2. **Determine Optimal Allocation:**
   - Give Agent 1 the highly valued items for them: Item 1 and Item 3, as they have the highest valuations for these items.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, as it is also highly valued by them (70) and relatively less valuable to Agent 1 (55).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1, as it is more valuable to them (85) compared to Agent 0 (45).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0, as it is valued by them (58) more than by Agent 1 (57).
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0, as it is more valuable to them (39) than to Agent 1 (11).

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 4, 5
- **Agent 1:** Items 1, 2, 3

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items that maximize their individual valuations while minimizing envy between them.
