Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  44  26  57  35  52
1  40  29   1  25  92  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we want to ensure that neither agent ends up with envy, ideally resulting in an envy-free allocation. Envy-freeness means that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of the other agent given their own valuations.

Let's determine an allocation by considering each agent's valuation for the items.

### Agent Valuations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 44
  - Item 1: 44
  - Item 2: 26
  - Item 3: 57
  - Item 4: 35
  - Item 5: 52

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 29
  - Item 2: 1
  - Item 3: 25
  - Item 4: 92
  - Item 5: 77

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 (57) and item 5 (52) highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 (92) and item 5 (77) highly.

2. **Direct Assignment of High-Value Items:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining Items Consideration:**
   - Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 0, 1, and 5.
   - Agent 1 has the next high valuation for item 5 and a reasonable valuation for item 0.

4. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 due to its higher overall value to Agent 1 compared to Agent 0's alternative high-value items.
   - Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0, as they are reasonably high-value for Agent 0 and not as high for Agent 1.

5. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (lowest value for Agent 1).
   - Assign any remaining item (either already done in previous steps).

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 1, 2, 3]
- **Agent 1:** Items [4, 5]

This allocation aims to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items that are relatively more valuable to them compared to the other agent.
