Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8  58  27  26  76  29
1  46  18  26  18  12  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness in mind, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent values their bundle at least as much as they value any other's bundle. We need to ensure that both agents feel that they are not worse off compared to the other agent.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 8
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 27
  - Item 3: 26
  - Item 4: 76
  - Item 5: 29

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 46
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 26
  - Item 3: 18
  - Item 4: 12
  - Item 5: 52

Let's try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while maintaining envy-freeness.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Highest Valuation Preference**: Allocate items to each agent based on their highest individual valuations while considering the other agent's preferences to ensure envy-freeness.
  
2. **Balancing**: Since there are 6 items, each agent should ideally get 3 items to keep the allocation integer-based and balanced.

#### Step-by-Step Allocation:
- **Agent 0**:
  - Highest value item: Item 4 (76)
  - Second-highest value item: Item 1 (58)
  - Third-highest value item: Item 5 (29)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest value item: Item 0 (46)
  - Second-highest value item: Item 5 (52) (already taken by Agent 0, so next best)
  - Third-highest value item: Item 2 (26)

### Final Allocation:
After reviewing the valuations and ensuring both agents get a fair share, we make the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations and ensure neither agent envies the others' allocation.
