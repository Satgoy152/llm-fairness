Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  43  41  11  24  12
1  29  58  71  53   4  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the two agents, we should consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should prefer their own allocation over the other agent's allocation based on their valuations. We will aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [89, 43, 41, 11, 24, 12]
- Agent 1: [29, 58, 71, 53, 4, 64]

Let's evaluate a possible allocation:

1. **Item 0 (value: 89, 29):** Agent 0 values this item significantly higher than Agent 1. Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1 (value: 43, 58):** Agent 1 values this item higher. Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2 (value: 41, 71):** Agent 1 values this item higher. Assign to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3 (value: 11, 53):** Agent 1 values this item higher. Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4 (value: 24, 4):** Agent 0 values this item higher. Assign to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5 (value: 12, 64):** Agent 1 values this item higher. Assign to Agent 1.

Under this allocation, both agents receive a fair share according to their valuations:

- Agent 0 has items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 has items 1, 2, 3, and 5.

Now, let's check the total values each agent receives:

- Agent 0: 89 (item 0) + 24 (item 4) = 113
- Agent 1: 58 (item 1) + 71 (item 2) + 53 (item 3) + 64 (item 5) = 246

It seems Agent 1 receives a significantly higher total value. To ensure a more balanced approach, we should consider another allocation where both agents feel treated fairly. Let's try redistributing:

1. **Item 0 (value: 89, 29):** Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1 (value: 43, 58):** Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2 (value: 41, 71):** Assign to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3 (value: 11, 53):** Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4 (value: 24, 4):** Assign to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5 (value: 12, 64):** Assign to Agent 0.

Now the allocation is:

- Agent 0: [0, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3]

Total values:
- Agent 0: 89 + 24 + 12 = 125
- Agent 1: 58 + 71 + 53 = 182

This allocation maintains that both agents receive their highest valued items and should feel less envious of each other.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
