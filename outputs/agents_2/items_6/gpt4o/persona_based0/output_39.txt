Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  26   6   3  43  76
1  54  71  18  56  14  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. We aim to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their own valuations.

First, let's look at the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 4 + 26 + 6 + 3 + 43 + 76 = 158
- Agent 1's total value: 54 + 71 + 18 + 56 + 14 + 93 = 306

Agent 1 values the items more highly in total than Agent 0, so we should aim to give Agent 1 items that they value highly, but in a way that balances perceived fairness.

Let's proceed to allocate the items:

1. Start by allocating high-value items to the agent who values them most.
2. Try to balance the perceived value from each agent's perspective.

### Allocation Process:

- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 76, and Agent 1 values it at 93. Give it to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 26, and Agent 1 values it at 71. Give it to Agent 1.
- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 4, and Agent 1 values it at 54. Give it to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 43, and Agent 1 values it at 14. Give it to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 3, and Agent 1 values it at 56. Give it to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 6, and Agent 1 values it at 18. Give it to Agent 1.

### Check and Balance:

- After initial allocation, Agent 0 has items [4].
- Agent 1 has items [5, 1, 0, 3, 2].

To balance the allocations, let's transfer one item:

- Agent 1 has significantly more items; we should transfer one item with the least impact on perceived fairness.
- Transferring item 0 to Agent 0 improves balance, as it has relatively low value for Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

Agent 0 has items [0, 4].  
Agent 1 has items [1, 2, 3, 5].

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value for each agent and provide a fair distribution of items.

{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
