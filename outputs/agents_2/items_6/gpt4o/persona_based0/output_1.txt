Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86   4  36  76  42  92
1  13  82  23  13  54   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we should consider the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if every agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent.

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- **Agent 0's valuations:** 86, 4, 36, 76, 42, 92
  - Total value = 86 + 4 + 36 + 76 + 42 + 92 = 336

- **Agent 1's valuations:** 13, 82, 23, 13, 54, 4
  - Total value = 13 + 82 + 23 + 13 + 54 + 4 = 189

The goal is to allocate the items such that neither agent envies the other's allocation. One approach is to try and balance the total value of the items assigned to each agent relative to their valuation scales.

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Allocate items based on maximum individual valuations:**
   - Assign item 5 (valued at 92 by agent 0) to agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 (valued at 82 by agent 1) to agent 1.

2. **Allocate remaining items to balance the total valuation:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 4
   - Assign item 0 (valued at 86 by agent 0) to agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 (valued at 76 by agent 0) to agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 (valued at 23 by agent 1) to agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 (valued at 54 by agent 1) to agent 1.

**Final allocations:**

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 3, 5
  - Total value for agent 0 = 86 + 76 + 92 = 254

- **Agent 1:** Items 1, 2, 4
  - Total value for agent 1 = 82 + 23 + 54 = 159

This allocation provides a relatively balanced distribution based on the agents' valuations, minimizing envy.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
