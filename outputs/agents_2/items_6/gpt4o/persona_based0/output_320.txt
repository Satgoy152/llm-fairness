Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2  3   4   5
0  66  27  60  9  99  55
1  81  94  61  5  21  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that aims to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels they are receiving a fair share, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as valuable as possible.

Let's evaluate the agents' preferences based on their valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [66, 27, 60, 9, 99, 55]
- Agent 1's valuations: [81, 94, 61, 5, 21, 63]

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can use an approach similar to the "divide and choose" method or try to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest-valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 4 (99) and item 0 (66).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (94) and item 0 (81).

2. **Allocate initial high-value items to each agent:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it is their highest-valued item.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.

3. **Distribute the remaining items to balance total valuations:**
   - After allocating the most valued items, consider the remaining items [0, 2, 3, 5].
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 to balance the high valuation of item 4 for Agent 0.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it holds significant value for them.
   - Assign item 2 and item 3 to balance the remaining valuations.

The allocations are adjusted to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences:

- Agent 0 receives items [4, 5].
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 1, 2, 3].

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```
