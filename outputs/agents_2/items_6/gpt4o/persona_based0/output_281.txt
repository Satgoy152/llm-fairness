Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  50  94  91  53  43
1  97  61  65   7  43  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their given valuations. In this case, we have two agents and six items. We will proceed with the "envy-free" allocation, which ensures that neither agent prefers the allocation of the other to their own.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [97, 50, 94, 91, 53, 43]
- Agent 1: [97, 61, 65, 7, 43, 37]

First, let's analyze the total valuations for each agent if they could choose all the items:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 97 + 50 + 94 + 91 + 53 + 43 = 428
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 97 + 61 + 65 + 7 + 43 + 37 = 310

Next, we will allocate items in a way that each agent gets an approximately equal share of their total valuation, keeping in mind the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items. 

Let's start by allocating the items:

1. **Item 0** has equal value for both agents (97). We can assign it to either agent, but let's give it to Agent 0 due to their generally higher valuations.
2. **Item 1** is more valuable to Agent 1 (61 vs. 50 for Agent 0). Assign it to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2** is more valuable to Agent 0 (94 vs. 65 for Agent 1). Assign it to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3** is more valuable to Agent 0 (91 vs. 7 for Agent 1). Assign it to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4** is slightly more valuable to Agent 0 (53 vs. 43 for Agent 1). Assign it to Agent 1, as Agent 1 has fewer items.
6. **Item 5** is more valuable to Agent 0 (43 vs. 37 for Agent 1). Assign it to Agent 1, balancing the number of items.

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 3]
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 97 + 94 + 91 = 282
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4, 5]
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 61 + 43 + 37 = 141

This allocation seems reasonable under the given valuations, as Agent 0 has a higher overall valuation, and both agents have three items each.

The allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
