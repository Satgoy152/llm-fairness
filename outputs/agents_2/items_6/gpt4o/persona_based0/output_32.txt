Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  29  51  93  17  89
1  47  62  60  88  71  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution as much as possible given the discrete nature of the items. An envy-free allocation occurs when no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to any other agent over their own bundle. While perfect envy-freeness might not be possible due to the discrete and indivisible nature of the items, we will try to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives a fair share.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [63, 29, 51, 93, 17, 89]
- Agent 1 values: [47, 62, 60, 88, 71, 57]

First, let's consider maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation items in descending order: 3 (93), 5 (89), 0 (63).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation items in descending order: 4 (71), 1 (62), 2 (60).

By allocating based on these preferences, we attempt to distribute items in a way that maximizes the valuation for each agent while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Here's how we can allocate the items:

- Assign items 3, 5, and 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 4, 1, and 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and aims to balance their total valuation fairly. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 0],
    "1": [4, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent 3 items and attempts to maximize their total valuation, reducing the potential for envy.
