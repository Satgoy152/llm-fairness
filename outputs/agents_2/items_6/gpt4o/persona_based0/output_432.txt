Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  27  30  50  49  43
1  22  72  15   5  94  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [22 72 15  5 94 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation to be at least as valuable as they perceive the allocation of the other agent, a concept known as envy-freeness.

Here, we have the valuations as follows:

- Agent 0: [75, 27, 30, 50, 49, 43]
- Agent 1: [22, 72, 15, 5, 94, 66]

Using these valuations, we attempt to allocate items to minimize envy. Let's explore an allocation:

1. **Allocate items based on highest individual preference:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 75.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 94.

Initially allocate:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [4]

2. **Allocate remaining items based on next highest preferences:**
   - Agent 0's next highest preference is item 3 at 50.
   - Agent 1's next highest preference is item 1 at 72.

Allocate:
- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [4, 1]

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Remaining items are 2 and 5.
   - Agent 0 perceives item 5 as 43 and item 2 as 30.
   - Agent 1 perceives item 5 as 66 and item 2 as 15.
   - Allocating item 5 to Agent 1 and item 2 to Agent 0 to balance the perceived values.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 3, 2]
- Agent 1: [4, 1, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets three items and attempts to minimize envy based on their highest valued items.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 2],
    "1": [4, 1, 5]
}
```
