Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  93   5  28  83  83
1  49  16  64  61  87  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. We should ensure that each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [3, 93, 5, 28, 83, 83]
- Agent 1's valuations: [49, 16, 64, 61, 87, 56]

To achieve an envy-free (or as envy-free as possible) allocation, we need to consider how each item is valued by both agents and distribute them to minimize the difference in perceived value.

One possible strategy is to allocate items based on a comparison of the relative values:

1. Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 0 and less so by Agent 1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Item 4 is highly valued by both, but slightly more by Agent 1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Item 5 is equally valued by Agent 0 and less by Agent 1. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
4. Item 3 is valued more by Agent 1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
5. Item 2 is valued more by Agent 1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
6. Item 0 is valued more by Agent 1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent perceives they are receiving:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 5, with total value: 93 + 83 = 176
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, 3, and 4, with total value: 49 + 64 + 61 + 87 = 261

While this allocation is not perfectly envy-free, it attempts to balance the high-value items between the two agents. Let's present the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
