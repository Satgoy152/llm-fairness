Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  97  18  11  34  87
1  59  73  62  27  49  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim for a division that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. One common approach is the "Envy-Free" allocation, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of any other agent, based on their own valuation.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(56 + 97 + 18 + 11 + 34 + 87 = 303\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(59 + 73 + 62 + 27 + 49 + 48 = 318\)

Given the available items, we need to ensure each agent has a fair share of the total value.

Let's consider the items individually and allocate them based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction for the items they receive:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 97, and Agent 1 values it at 73. This item should go to Agent 0 as they value it more.
2. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 87, and Agent 1 values it at 48. Allocate it to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 18, and Agent 1 values it at 62. Allocate it to Agent 1.
4. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 56, and Agent 1 values it at 59. Allocate it to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 34, and Agent 1 values it at 49. Allocate it to Agent 1.
6. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 11, and Agent 1 values it at 27. Allocate it to Agent 1.

After the allocation, let's evaluate whether each agent received a fair share:

- **Agent 0's allocation**: Items 1 and 5, total value = \(97 + 87 = 184\)
- **Agent 1's allocation**: Items 0, 2, 3, and 4, total value = \(59 + 62 + 27 + 49 = 197\)

Both agents have received a portion of the total value that is proportional to their overall valuation, considering that there are small discrepancies due to the discrete nature of item allocations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent has at least as good a share as they could expect given the constraints of discrete item allocations.
