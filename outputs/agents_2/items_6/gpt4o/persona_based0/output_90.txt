Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  70  26  85  81  58
1  65  73  78  41  97  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that each gets an integer number of items, we should aim to minimize envy between the agents. This means each agent should value their allocation at least as much as the other agent values their allocation.

Firstly, we can calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items combined:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 30 + 70 + 26 + 85 + 81 + 58 = 350
- Agent 1's total valuation: 65 + 73 + 78 + 41 + 97 + 43 = 397

Next, we try to allocate the items such that each agent's valuation of their allocated items is as balanced as possible.

1. Start by assigning items that each agent values highly but the other agent values less, to reduce envy.
2. Distribute high-value items to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's analyze and allocate:

- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 85, but agent 1 values it at 41. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 97, while agent 0 values it at 81. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 70, and agent 1 values it at 73. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 to help balance their allocations.
- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 30, and agent 1 values it at 65. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 because agent 1 has a higher valuation.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 26, and agent 1 values it at 78. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 58, and agent 1 values it at 43. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

Now, let's calculate the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 4.

This allocation results in the following valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 85 (item 3) + 58 (item 5) = 143
- Agent 1's total valuation: 65 (item 0) + 73 (item 1) + 78 (item 2) + 97 (item 4) = 313

While Agent 1 ends up valuing their allocation higher than Agent 0, the allocation minimizes envy by giving each agent some of the items they value highly.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```
