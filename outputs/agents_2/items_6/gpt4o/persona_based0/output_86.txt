Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  27  46  51  53   0
1  11  27  40  36  76  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1) while ensuring envy-freeness and integer allocations, we consider the valuations provided in the table. Our goal is to distribute the items in such a way that neither agent envies the other's allocation, as much as possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation Process:

1. **Identify Key Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values: [62, 27, 46, 51, 53, 0]
   - Agent 1 values: [11, 27, 40, 36, 76, 46]

2. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: \(62 + 27 + 46 + 51 + 53 + 0 = 239\)
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: \(11 + 27 + 40 + 36 + 76 + 46 = 236\)

3. **Determine Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0 (\(62\)) and 4 (\(53\)).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 4 (\(76\)) and 5 (\(46\)).

4. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation Differences:**
   - Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 0 (62) and less by Agent 1 (11). Thus, allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Item 4 is more highly valued by Agent 1 (76) than by Agent 0 (53). Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Item 5 is valued by Agent 1 (46) and not valued by Agent 0 (0). Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

5. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Items 1, 2, and 3 remain. Allocate based on remaining valuations:
     - Item 1: Both agents value it equally (27), but allocate to Agent 0 to balance the total number of items.
     - Item 2: Allocate to Agent 0 as they value it more (46) versus Agent 1 (40).
     - Item 3: Allocate to Agent 1 as they value it more (36) versus Agent 0 (51).

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 2
   - Agent 1 receives items: 3, 4, 5

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent items they value highly while ensuring each agent receives exactly three items.
