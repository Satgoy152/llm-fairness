Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  49  45  55  13   0
1  75  97   8  29  86  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [75 97  8 29 86 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, meaning each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as the other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to finding an envy-free allocation:

1. **List Valuations:**

   - Agent 0: [77, 49, 45, 55, 13, 0]
   - Agent 1: [75, 97, 8, 29, 86, 48]

2. **Sum of Valuations:**

   - Total value for Agent 0: 77 + 49 + 45 + 55 + 13 + 0 = 239
   - Total value for Agent 1: 75 + 97 + 8 + 29 + 86 + 48 = 343

3. **Initial Analysis:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (77), followed by item 3 (55).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (97), followed by item 4 (86).

4. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Allocate items to maximize perceived value for each agent, ensuring no agent envies the other.

5. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent based on their preferences, ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 6.

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [0, 3, 2]
   - Agent 1: [1, 4, 5]

**Explanation:**

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 3, 2] with valuations [77, 55, 45], totaling 177.
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 4, 5] with valuations [97, 86, 48], totaling 231.

Each agent receives items that maximize their valuations without envying the other allocation. Now, presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 2],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
