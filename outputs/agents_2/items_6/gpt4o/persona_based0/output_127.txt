Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  15  98  16  75   0
1  91  21   2  55  67  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, if possible. Envy-freeness means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation according to their own valuations.

Let's begin by analyzing the valuation matrix for both agents:

- Agent 0's valuations: [15, 15, 98, 16, 75, 0]
- Agent 1's valuations: [91, 21, 2, 55, 67, 94]

We need to allocate all 6 items between these two agents. One way to do this is to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation:

1. **Step 1**: Start by allocating the highest-valued items for each agent, in a way that maximizes their satisfaction and minimizes envy.

2. **Agent 0's highest valued items**:
   - Item 2 (98)
   - Item 4 (75)
   - Item 3 (16)
   - Item 0 (15)

3. **Agent 1's highest valued items**:
   - Item 0 (91)
   - Item 5 (94)
   - Item 3 (55)
   - Item 4 (67)

4. **Step 2**: Assign items to agents prioritizing their highest valuations, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (94 vs. 0)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (98 vs. 2)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (91 vs. 15)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (75 vs. 67)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (55 vs. 16)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (15 vs. 21)

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 4, 1
- Agent 1 receives items: 5, 0, 3

Agent 0's total valuation: 98 + 75 + 15 = 188
Agent 1's total valuation: 94 + 91 + 55 = 240

This allocation is fair because each agent receives the items that maximize their individual valuations, and it ensures that both agents have a collection of high-value items according to their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 1],
    "1": [5, 0, 3]
}
```
