Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  56  10  58  78  85
1  12  68  69  32  41  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should feel satisfied with their allocation given their personal valuations of the items.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [21, 56, 10, 58, 78, 85]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [12, 68, 69, 32, 41, 91]

The goal is to allocate all 6 items in a way that minimizes envy.

### Steps to Allocate

1. **Highest Value Allocation:** Start by assigning the item with the highest value for each agent, ensuring no conflict.
2. **Balance Remaining Items:** Consider the remaining items and allocate them to balance the total value each agent receives.

### Allocation Process

1. **Initial High Value Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Item 5 (Value: 85)
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (Value: 91)
   - Since both agents value item 5 highly, we need to decide who should get it. Let's give it to Agent 1 as it is their highest value. 

2. **Allocate remaining items to balance the total value:**
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (Value: 78) and Item 3 (Value: 58)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (Value: 68), Item 2 (Value: 69), and Item 0 (Value: 12)

### Final Allocation

- Agent 0 receives items [3, 4], receiving a total value of 58 + 78 = 136.
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 1, 2, 5], receiving a total value of 12 + 68 + 69 + 91 = 240.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and although Agent 1 receives more total value, each agent gets their high-valued items or a balanced share.

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation strategy attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they highly value, based on the constraints.
