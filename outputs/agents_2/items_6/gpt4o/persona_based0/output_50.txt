Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22  13  61  83  52  28
1  31  77  13  29  87  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, let's first analyze the valuations of each agent for each item. Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, minimizing envy as much as possible.

Here's the table with valuations again for clarity:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 22     | 13     | 61     | 83     | 52     | 28     |
| 1     | 31     | 77     | 13     | 29     | 87     | 16     |

We aim to allocate items in a way that each agent values their bundle highly. A common approach is to maximize the sum of valuations each agent receives, while ensuring that the allocations are as envy-free as possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**
   - Highest Value: Item 3 (83)
   - Second Highest: Item 2 (61)
   - Third Highest: Item 4 (52)

2. **Agent 1**
   - Highest Value: Item 4 (87)
   - Second Highest: Item 1 (77)
   - Third Highest: Item 0 (31)

### Proposed Allocation:

- Give Agent 0 the items that they value highly: Items 2 and 3.
- Give Agent 1 the items that they value highly: Items 1 and 4.
  
This leaves Items 0 and 5 unallocated. Let's assign these based on minimizing envy:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 2, 3, and 5
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 1, and 4

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their bundle while maintaining a fair division of the items.
