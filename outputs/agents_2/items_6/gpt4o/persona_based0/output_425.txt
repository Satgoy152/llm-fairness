Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  75  51  61  22  22
1  55  18  73   6  51  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that both agents feel as satisfied as possible, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to each item. The goal is to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's begin by examining the valuations:

Agent 0:  
- Item 0: 11  
- Item 1: 75  
- Item 2: 51  
- Item 3: 61  
- Item 4: 22  
- Item 5: 22  

Agent 1:  
- Item 0: 55  
- Item 1: 18  
- Item 2: 73  
- Item 3: 6  
- Item 4: 51  
- Item 5: 17  

The total value each agent assigns can be calculated by summing their respective valuations:

- Total value for Agent 0: 11 + 75 + 51 + 61 + 22 + 22 = 242
- Total value for Agent 1: 55 + 18 + 73 + 6 + 51 + 17 = 220

We aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. One way to achieve this is by ensuring that the sum of the values of items allocated to each agent is as close as possible, while respecting the integer allocation constraint.

Let's attempt an allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values Items 1 (75) and 3 (61).
2. **Agent 1** highly values Items 0 (55) and 2 (73).

Based on these preferences, a potential allocation might be:

- Allocate Items 1 and 3 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Items 0 and 2 to Agent 1.

After this allocation, we have:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 3 (75 + 61 = 136)
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 and 2 (55 + 73 = 128)

The remaining items are Items 4 and 5. Let's allocate based on who values them more:

- **Agent 0** values Item 4 as 22 and Item 5 as 22.
- **Agent 1** values Item 4 as 51 and Item 5 as 17.

To balance values and fairness, allocate:

- Item 4 to Agent 1 (who values it more)
- Item 5 to Agent 0

The final allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 3, 5 (75 + 61 + 22 = 158)
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 2, 4 (55 + 73 + 51 = 179)

This allocation ensures both agents receive a significant share of their valued items, balancing the total valuations as closely as possible.

Here's the JSON representation of the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
