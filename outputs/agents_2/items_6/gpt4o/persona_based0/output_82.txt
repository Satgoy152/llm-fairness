Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  16  50  64  11  19
1  49  98  11  63  93  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim for an allocation that is envy-free or at least as fair as possible given the constraints. Let's consider the valuations of each agent for each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: [59, 16, 50, 64, 11, 19]
- Agent 1's valuations: [49, 98, 11, 63, 93, 29]

Let's start by allocating the items to the agents based on maximizing their individual utility while keeping the allocation fair:

1. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values this item at 98, which is significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation of 16. Therefore, allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values this at 93, which is much higher compared to Agent 0's valuation of 11. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 3:** Both agents value this item highly, but Agent 0 values it slightly higher (64 vs. 63). Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values this item significantly higher (59 vs. 49). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values this item much higher (50 vs. 11). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5:** Neither agent has a particularly strong preference, but Agent 1 has a slightly higher valuation (29 vs. 19). Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 3. Their total valuation is 59 + 50 + 64 = 173.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 4, and 5. Their total valuation is 98 + 93 + 29 = 220.

While this allocation isn't perfectly envy-free, it attempts to maximize each agent's utility given the constraints and ensures that each agent receives three items.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
