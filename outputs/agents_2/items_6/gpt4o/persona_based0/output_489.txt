Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  54  54  31  61   5
1  58  25  95  85  41  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 25 95 85 41 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to achieve envy-freeness, we'll consider the valuations provided. The goal is to ensure that each agent perceives the allocation as fair based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives items with a total value as close as possible to their preferred outcome.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

```
Agent 0: [4, 54, 54, 31, 61, 5]
Agent 1: [58, 25, 95, 85, 41, 73]
```

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values items 1 and 2 highly (54 each), followed by item 4 (61).
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest (95), followed by item 3 (85) and item 5 (73).

A potential fair allocation strategy could be:

- Assign items with high valuations to the agent who values them most, while ensuring the total value for each agent is balanced.

Allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Items: 0, 1, 4
  - Total valuation: 4 + 54 + 61 = 119

- **Agent 1**:
  - Items: 2, 3, 5
  - Total valuation: 95 + 85 + 73 = 253

This allocation ensures both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations, and minimizes envy since each agent receives highly valued items according to their preferences.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
