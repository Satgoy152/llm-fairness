Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  74  99  94  57  87
1  29  58  26  56  68  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29 58 26 56 68 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to carefully evaluate the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate all six items such that neither agent envies the other's allocation, or at least minimize the envy while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

```
Agent 0: 87, 74, 99, 94, 57, 87
Agent 1: 29, 58, 26, 56, 68, 64
```

First, let's sum up the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 87 + 74 + 99 + 94 + 57 + 87 = 498
- Total value for Agent 1: 29 + 58 + 26 + 56 + 68 + 64 = 301

Next, to achieve an envy-free or nearly envy-free allocation, we should aim to balance the perceived value each agent receives from the items allocated to them.

Let's analyze the high-value items for each agent:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0, 2, 3, and 5.
- Agent 1 values items 4 and 5 relatively more compared to other items.

A potential allocation strategy is to give each agent items that maximize their satisfaction without causing significant envy:

1. Allocate items 0, 2, and 3 to Agent 0. These items are highly valued by Agent 0.
2. Allocate items 1, 4, and 5 to Agent 1. While item 5 is also valuable to Agent 0, giving it to Agent 1 helps balance the allocation since Agent 1 values item 4 more than Agent 0 does.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 5

Let's check the total valuation each agent gets from their allocation:

- Total value for Agent 0: 87 (Item 0) + 99 (Item 2) + 94 (Item 3) = 280
- Total value for Agent 1: 58 (Item 1) + 68 (Item 4) + 64 (Item 5) = 190

While Agent 0 still gets a higher total value, this allocation ensures that Agent 1 receives items they value relatively more, reducing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
