Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  48  87  79   2  76
1  26  27  12  96  52  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 27 12 96 52 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own bundle.

Hereâ€™s the valuation matrix for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 49     | 48     | 87     | 79     | 2      | 76     |
| 1     | 26     | 27     | 12     | 96     | 52     | 39     |

We will proceed with the allocation by considering the maximum value each agent assigns to the items, and try to ensure that both agents get a fair share of the total valuation.

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the most with a value of 87.
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 the most with a value of 96.

2. **Allocate the highest valued items to each agent**:
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate the remaining items by considering remaining valuations**:
   - Agent 0's next highest value is for Item 0 (49), then Item 5 (76).
   - Agent 1's next highest value is for Item 4 (52), then Item 1 (27).

4. **Distribute remaining items to balance valuations**:
   - Agent 0 receives Items 0, 2, and 5.
   - Agent 1 receives Items 1, 3, and 4.

This allocation attempts to balance fairness based on the agents' valuations, ensuring that each agent gets items they value relatively highly.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
