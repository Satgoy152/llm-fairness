Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  44  96  82  18  70
1  90  89  28  22  86  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90 89 28 22 86 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the other agent's allocation. We will use the valuations given to ensure the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [61, 44, 96, 82, 18, 70]
- Agent 1: [90, 89, 28, 22, 86, 19]

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 61 + 44 + 96 + 82 + 18 + 70 = 371
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 90 + 89 + 28 + 22 + 86 + 19 = 334

Now, let's try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's perceived value while keeping the allocation as fair as possible. 

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Give items 2, 3, and 5 to Agent 0.
- Give items 0, 1, and 4 to Agent 1.

Let's check the valuation for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 2, 3, and 5: 96 + 82 + 70 = 248
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 4: 90 + 89 + 86 = 265

This allocation gives both agents a similar total perceived value, and neither agent envies the other's allocation significantly, considering the maximum individual item valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
