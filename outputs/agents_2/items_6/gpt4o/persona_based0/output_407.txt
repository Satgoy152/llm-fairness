Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  39  35  19  26  95
1  63  85  15  84  33  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we consider the valuations provided for each item by the agents. The goal is to ensure each agent perceives their allocation as fair or at least as good as the other agent's allocation.

Here are the valuations for each item by both agents:

- Agent 0: [84, 39, 35, 19, 26, 95]
- Agent 1: [63, 85, 15, 84, 33, 67]

To achieve an allocation, we can follow these steps:
1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Try to assign items to maximize each agent's total perceived value while ensuring each agent feels satisfied with their allocation.

### Strategy:
- Start by allocating the item with the highest individual value to the agent who values it the most.
- Continue allocating items, balancing total values between agents to minimize envy.

### Allocation Process:
1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 84.
   - Agent 1 values it at 63.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 39.
   - Agent 1 values it at 85.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 35.
   - Agent 1 values it at 15.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 19.
   - Agent 1 values it at 84.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 26.
   - Agent 1 values it at 33.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 95.
   - Agent 1 values it at 67.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 1 receives items: [1, 3, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that they value highly relative to the other agent's valuation, striving for a fair distribution.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
