Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98   0  77  87   4  18
1  10  56   1  36  37  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents such that envy-freeness is maximized, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives according to their valuations. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Value per Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Values are [98, 0, 77, 87, 4, 18], total = 98 + 0 + 77 + 87 + 4 + 18 = 284
   - Agent 1: Values are [10, 56, 1, 36, 37, 19], total = 10 + 56 + 1 + 36 + 37 + 19 = 159

2. **Item Allocation Strategy:**
   - We aim to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

3. **Proportional Share Calculation:**
   - The proportional share for each agent can be calculated as:
     - Agent 0: 284 / (284 + 159) * 100% = 64.1%
     - Agent 1: 159 / (284 + 159) * 100% = 35.9%

4. **Allocate Items:**
   - To minimize envy, distribute items based on the highest value for each agent where possible.

5. **Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (98), item 2 (77), and item 3 (87). Allocate items 0, 2, and 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (56), item 4 (37), and item 5 (19). Allocate items 1, 4, and 5 to Agent 1.

This allocation tries to balance the total perceived value for each agent according to their preferences. 

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
