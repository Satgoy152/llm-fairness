Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20   3  20  18  48  23
1  62  50  51  56  60   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should be at least as happy with their own allocation as they would be with the other agent's allocation.

Here are the valuation matrices for clarity:

- **Agent 0's Valuation:**
  - Item 0: 20
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 20
  - Item 3: 18
  - Item 4: 48
  - Item 5: 23

- **Agent 1's Valuation:**
  - Item 0: 62
  - Item 1: 50
  - Item 2: 51
  - Item 3: 56
  - Item 4: 60
  - Item 5: 9

To find a fair division, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, while aiming to minimize envy.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items with high valuation: 4 (48), 5 (23), 3 (18)
   - Total value for Agent 0: 48 + 23 + 18 = 89

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items with high valuation: 0 (62), 2 (51), 1 (50)
   - Total value for Agent 1: 62 + 51 + 50 = 163

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a set of items that they highly value, and the sum of the allocations matches the number of items available. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation is fair considering each agent's valuation, and both agents receive items that maximize their individual preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.
