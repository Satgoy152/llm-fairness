Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  51  84  61  36   2
1  24  36  62  40  44  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, ideally minimizing envy between them. One way to do this is by considering each agent's valuation of the items and attempting to balance the total value each agent receives according to their own valuation.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 12 + 51 + 84 + 61 + 36 + 2 = 246
- Agent 1's total value: 24 + 36 + 62 + 40 + 44 + 69 = 275

Next, we'll attempt to allocate the items to balance these values as evenly as possible:

1. **Allocate by maximizing individual item value**: We can start by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent based on their individual preferences.

2. **Balancing overall allocation**: After initial allocation, we can adjust the allocation to ensure the total value each agent receives is as close as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (84), allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most (69), allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

2. **Allocate remaining items to balance total values**:
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 3, 4
   - Agent 0: Current total = 84 (item 2)
   - Agent 1: Current total = 69 (item 5)

3. **Allocate item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 51, Agent 1 values it at 36.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0. New total for Agent 0 = 84 + 51 = 135

4. **Allocate item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 61, Agent 1 values it at 40.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0. New total for Agent 0 = 135 + 61 = 196

5. **Allocate item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 12, Agent 1 values it at 24.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1. New total for Agent 1 = 69 + 24 = 93

6. **Allocate item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 36, Agent 1 values it at 44.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1. New total for Agent 1 = 93 + 44 = 137

Finally, the allocation should be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives based on their individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
