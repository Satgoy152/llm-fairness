Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  35  62  49  43  37
1  74  86  10  96  94  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring envy-freeness, if possible. Envy-freeness implies that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent to their own, given their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [44, 35, 62, 49, 43, 37]
- Agent 1's valuations: [74, 86, 10, 96, 94, 44]

To start, we can try to allocate items in such a way that each agent gets items they value highly, while balancing the total value each agent receives. A heuristic approach is to allow each agent to take turns picking their highest-valued item that hasn't been allocated yet.

1. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (96), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the second highest (86), so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 1 values item 4 next (94), so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (62), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
5. Agent 0 values item 0 next (44), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
6. Agent 0 values item 5 next (37), so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

Now let's review the allocations:

- Agent 0 has items [2, 0, 5], with total valuation = 62 + 44 + 37 = 143
- Agent 1 has items [3, 1, 4], with total valuation = 96 + 86 + 94 = 276

This allocation respects each agent's highest preferences given the constraints and results in each agent getting 3 items.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 5],
    "1": [3, 1, 4]
}
```
