Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  21  88  93  60  63
1  86   7  64  94  94  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent. In this case, we don't have to achieve perfect envy-freeness, but we can try to make each agent as satisfied as possible with the allocation they receive.

Let's first list the total valuations each agent has for each item:

- Agent 0: (75, 21, 88, 93, 60, 63)
- Agent 1: (86, 7, 64, 94, 94, 20)

Now, let's consider allocating the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (93), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the same as item 3 (94), but since item 3 is already allocated, we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Next, for Agent 0, the highest remaining valued item is item 2 (88), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 0 (86), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
5. Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 5 (63), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
6. Finally, the only remaining item is item 1, which we allocate to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value highly while attempting to balance the overall satisfaction between the two agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
