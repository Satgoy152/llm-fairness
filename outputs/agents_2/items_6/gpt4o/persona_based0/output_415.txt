Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  91  22  60  12   9
1  13  39  24  91  94  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy and attempt to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. The agents' valuations for each item are as follows:

- Agent 0: [35, 91, 22, 60, 12, 9]
- Agent 1: [13, 39, 24, 91, 94, 30]

One approach to achieve fairness is to use the "maximum marginal utility" principle, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring both agents receive an approximately equal total value.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 1** (value 91 for agent 0, value 39 for agent 1) should go to agent 0, as they value it more.
2. **Item 4** (value 12 for agent 0, value 94 for agent 1) should go to agent 1, as they value it significantly more.
3. **Item 3** (value 60 for agent 0, value 91 for agent 1) should go to agent 1, as they value it more.
4. **Item 0** (value 35 for agent 0, value 13 for agent 1) should go to agent 0, as they value it more.
5. **Item 2** (value 22 for agent 0, value 24 for agent 1) is slightly more valued by agent 1, so it goes to agent 1.
6. **Item 5** (value 9 for agent 0, value 30 for agent 1) should go to agent 1, as they value it more.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 0].
- Agent 1 receives items [4, 3, 2, 5].

Verifying the total values for each agent:

- Total value for Agent 0: 91 (item 1) + 35 (item 0) = 126
- Total value for Agent 1: 94 (item 4) + 91 (item 3) + 24 (item 2) + 30 (item 5) = 239

While not perfectly balanced in terms of total valuation, this allocation gives each item to the agent who values it most. Given the constraints, this is a fair allocation based on maximizing total utility for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [4, 3, 2, 5]
}
```
