Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  87  35   0  33   6
1  22  76  44  95  24  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. We need to ensure each agent receives items in a way that they perceive as fair. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Valuations Matrix**:
   ```
   Agent 0: [98, 87, 35, 0, 33, 6]
   Agent 1: [22, 76, 44, 95, 24, 66]
   ```

2. **Total Valuation per Agent**:
   - Agent 0: 98 + 87 + 35 + 0 + 33 + 6 = 259
   - Agent 1: 22 + 76 + 44 + 95 + 24 + 66 = 327

3. **Maximize Valuation for Each Agent**:
   - Identify the highest value items for each agent and try to allocate them in a way that is envy-free.

4. **Item Allocation Strategy**:
   - **Agent 0**: Prioritize items where Agent 0 has a much higher valuation compared to Agent 1.
   - **Agent 1**: Prioritize items where Agent 1 has a much higher valuation compared to Agent 0.

5. **Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 much more than Agent 1: Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 significantly more than Agent 0: Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1, compared to Agent 1: Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 more than Agent 0: Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Compare the remaining items and allocate based on remaining values:
     - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0.
     - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it slightly more.

6. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [0, 1]
   - Agent 1: [2, 3, 4, 5]

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
