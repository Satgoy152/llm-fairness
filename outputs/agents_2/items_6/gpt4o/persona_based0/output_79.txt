Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  25  62  82  36  55
1  21  65   5   5  47  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on the given valuations, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints of integer allocation.

The valuations of the items by each agent are as follows:

- Agent 0: [76, 25, 62, 82, 36, 55]
- Agent 1: [21, 65, 5, 5, 47, 38]

An approach to achieve a fair allocation is to assign items to agents based on which agent values them the most, while also ensuring both agents receive a similar total valuation.

Let's evaluate the items one by one:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 76, while Agent 1 values it at 21. Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 25, while Agent 1 values it at 65. Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 62, while Agent 1 values it at 5. Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 82, while Agent 1 values it at 5. Assign to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 36, while Agent 1 values it at 47. Assign to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 55, while Agent 1 values it at 38. Assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's add up the total valuations for each agent to check the fairness:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 76 + 62 + 82 + 55 = 275
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 65 + 47 = 112

This allocation gives Agent 0 significantly more total value. To balance the allocations more fairly, we can attempt to swap some items:

**Revised Allocation:**

1. Assign Items 0 and 3 to Agent 0 (Valuation: 76 + 82 = 158).
2. Assign Items 1, 4, and 5 to Agent 1 (Valuation: 65 + 47 + 38 = 150).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (Valuation: 62).

Final total valuations:
- Agent 0: 76 + 82 + 62 = 220
- Agent 1: 65 + 47 + 38 = 150

Given the constraints, this is a more balanced allocation. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and aims to maintain a degree of fairness based on the agents' valuations.
