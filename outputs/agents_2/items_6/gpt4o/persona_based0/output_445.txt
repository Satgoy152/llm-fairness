Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  35   4   0  26  42
1  32  71  62  97  29  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [32 71 62 97 29 61]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can aim for an allocation that is envy-free and ensures both agents receive items that maximize their personal valuations.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 94 + 35 + 4 + 0 + 26 + 42 = 201
- Agent 1's total valuation: 32 + 71 + 62 + 97 + 29 + 61 = 352

Given the valuations, one approach is to allocate the items so that each agent receives a set of items that they value highly, while trying to maintain balance in their overall perceived value from the allocation.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. Start by assigning the item each agent values the most.
2. Continue assigning items to agents while trying to balance the total value each receives.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

- **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the most (94), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the most (97), so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
  
Next, consider the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Agent 0's valuation for these: 35, 4, 26, 42
- Agent 1's valuation for these: 71, 62, 29, 61

- **Agent 1**: Values item 1 (71) next highest, allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- **Agent 0**: Values item 5 (42) next highest, allocate item 5 to agent 0.
  
The items 2 and 4 remain:

- **Agent 1**: Values item 2 (62) more than item 4 (29), so allocate item 2 to agent 1.
- **Agent 0**: Left with item 4, allocate item 4 to agent 0.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 5, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 3, 1, 2

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value highly, distributing the items in a manner that is likely to be envy-free given the valuations.

{
    "0": [0, 5, 4],
    "1": [3, 1, 2]
}
```
