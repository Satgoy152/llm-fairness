Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  12  78  88  44  73
1  64  78  39  37  94  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize each agent's perceived value of the items they receive. We will consider each agent's valuation and try to balance the allocations to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's go through the items and allocate them based on the highest value each agent places on the items, ensuring that all items are allocated:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 9.
   - Agent 1 values it at 64.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 12.
   - Agent 1 values it at 78.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 78.
   - Agent 1 values it at 39.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 88.
   - Agent 1 values it at 37.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 44.
   - Agent 1 values it at 94.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 73.
   - Agent 1 values it at 97.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

Now let's check the total number of items each agent receives:
- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 4, 5

This allocation ensures that both agents receive some items and that the distribution is based on their highest valuations, aiming for a fair allocation.

The final allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5]
}
```
