Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  59  77  67  72  31
1  17  84  11  58   9  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation and ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for the items and try to allocate in such a way that no agent envies the other's allocation. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation received by the other agent according to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations for the items:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [51, 59, 77, 67, 72, 31]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [17, 84, 11, 58, 9, 37]

One common approach to achieve fairness is to allocate items based on maximizing the minimum envy or maximizing the total utility for each agent where possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (77), followed by item 4 (72), and item 3 (67).

2. **Agent 1's Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (84), followed by item 3 (58).

### Allocation Plan:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
  - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).

- **Agent 1:**
  - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (0, 3, 5) considering the remaining highest valuations and ensuring fairness:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest value of 51).
  - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest value of 31).

- **Agent 1:**
  - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (second highest value of 58).

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a number of items that maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations, reducing the possibility of envy.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 6 items between the two agents fairly based on their valuations.
