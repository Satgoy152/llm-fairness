Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  32   4  64  20  71
1  76  19  58  85  13  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the discrete nature of the problem. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as the allocation of any other agent.

First, let's summarize the information:

- Agent 0's valuations: [12, 32, 4, 64, 20, 71]
- Agent 1's valuations: [76, 19, 58, 85, 13, 26]

We aim to maximize the minimum satisfaction (or valuation sum) for each agent.

### Steps for Allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**

   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 12 + 32 + 4 + 64 + 20 + 71 = 203
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 76 + 19 + 58 + 85 + 13 + 26 = 277

2. **Identify Initial Allocation Strategy:**

   - Begin by allocating the items based on the highest individual valuations from each agent's perspective, without creating envy.

3. **Allocate Items:**

   - Agent 1 values item 3 highly (85), which is their highest single valuation; allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 5 highly (71), which is their highest single valuation; allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it significantly higher (76) than Agent 0 (12).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it significantly higher (32) than Agent 1 (19).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it significantly higher (58) than Agent 0 (4).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as Agent 1 has a low valuation for it (13).

By following the above steps, the allocation should be as follows, ensuring that each agent receives a set of items that they value without feeling envious of the other agent's allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives three items, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the differing valuations.
