Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  45  15  90  12  61
1  11  91  39  96  52  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 91 39 96 52 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for each item. A fair allocation can be achieved by aiming for an envy-free division, where each agent feels that they have received at least as much value as the other agent.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [60, 45, 15, 90, 12, 61]
- Agent 1's valuations: [11, 91, 39, 96, 52, 87]

The goal is to allocate the 6 items such that both agents have roughly equal total value according to their own valuations.

First, calculate the total value each agent would receive if they got all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 60 + 45 + 15 + 90 + 12 + 61 = 283
- Total value for Agent 1: 11 + 91 + 39 + 96 + 52 + 87 = 376

The average value for each agent if items were split perfectly according to total value would be:

- Average value for Agent 0: 283 / 2 = 141.5
- Average value for Agent 1: 376 / 2 = 188

Now, let's determine a fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (value 90), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (value 91) and item 3 (value 96), but item 3 is already allocated. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 1 also values item 5 highly (value 87), so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it has the second-highest value for Agent 0 (value 60).
5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it has a reasonable value for Agent 1 (value 39) and lower value for Agent 0.
6. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it balances the remaining allocations and has a relatively low value for both agents but slightly higher for Agent 1.

Let's verify the allocation for balance:
- Agent 0's allocated items: [3, 0, 4]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 90 + 60 + 12 = 162
- Agent 1's allocated items: [1, 5, 2]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 91 + 87 + 39 = 217

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value between the agents while keeping the allocation envy-free.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5, 2]
}
```
