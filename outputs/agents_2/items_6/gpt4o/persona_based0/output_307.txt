Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  46   5  70  16  88  94
1  67  97  33  52  56  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [67 97 33 52 56 88]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as balanced as possible in terms of each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. One approach is to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, ensuring neither agent feels envious of the other's total allocation.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 46 + 5 + 70 + 16 + 88 + 94 = 319
- Agent 1's total value: 67 + 97 + 33 + 52 + 56 + 88 = 393

Now, let's consider potential allocations:

1. **Allocation Proposal:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 5]
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 4]

**Valuation for this allocation:**
- Agent 0's total valuation: 46 (item 0) + 70 (item 2) + 94 (item 5) = 210
- Agent 1's total valuation: 97 (item 1) + 52 (item 3) + 56 (item 4) = 205

This allocation gives both agents a fairly balanced total valuation, minimizing envy as much as possible considering the integer allocation constraint.

Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
