Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  62   0  95  72  42
1  36  50  23  29  30  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [36 50 23 29 30 21]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as the allocation of the other agent, given their own valuations.

Let's start by analyzing the table:

- Agent 0's valuations: [87, 62, 0, 95, 72, 42]
- Agent 1's valuations: [36, 50, 23, 29, 30, 21]

Our goal is to distribute the items (0 through 5) such that both agents are satisfied with their allocations. A common strategy is to prioritize allocating high-value items for each agent while also ensuring a balance in the overall perceived value.

1. **High-value items for Agent 0**: 
   - Item 3 (95)
   - Item 0 (87)

2. **High-value items for Agent 1**:
   - Item 1 (50)
   - Item 2 (23)

Now, let's allocate the remaining items while ensuring fairness:

3. **Remaining items**:
   - Items left: 4 and 5
   - Agent 0's valuation: [72, 42]
   - Agent 1's valuation: [30, 21]

Given Agent 0's higher valuation for item 4 compared to item 5, let's allocate item 4 to Agent 0 and item 5 to Agent 1 to balance the total perceived value.

Here's the proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 5]

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
