Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  71  73  43  26  22
1  73  48  76  41  46  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents, we need to consider their valuations of the items to ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share. The goal is to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, meaning each agent believes they have received a bundle of items at least as good as the other agent's bundle.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the Valuations:**

   - Agent 0: [42, 71, 73, 43, 26, 22]
   - Agent 1: [73, 48, 76, 41, 46, 55]

2. **Calculate Total Valuations:**

   - Total value for Agent 0: \(42 + 71 + 73 + 43 + 26 + 22 = 277\)
   - Total value for Agent 1: \(73 + 48 + 76 + 41 + 46 + 55 = 339\)

3. **Determine Allocations:**

   We aim to divide the items such that the perceived value is roughly equal for each agent. One method is to allocate items starting from the one with the highest combined valuation, ensuring that the allocation is balanced according to the agents' perceived values.

4. **Allocate Items:**

   Start by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensure a fair distribution:

   - **Agent 0's Top Valued Items:**
     - Item 2 (Value 73)
     - Item 1 (Value 71)
     - Item 3 (Value 43)

   - **Agent 1's Top Valued Items:**
     - Item 2 (Value 76)
     - Item 0 (Value 73)
     - Item 5 (Value 55)

   - To balance the allocation, assign the items as follows:
     - Agent 0 receives items that maximize their value: [0, 1, 3]
     - Agent 1 receives items that maximize their value: [2, 4, 5]

5. **Check the Allocations:**

   - **Agent 0's Total Value:**
     - Items [0, 1, 3]: \(42 + 71 + 43 = 156\)

   - **Agent 1's Total Value:**
     - Items [2, 4, 5]: \(76 + 46 + 55 = 177\)

The allocations provide a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations. Both agents receive items that maximize their perceived value, minimizing potential envy.

6. **Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their individual valuations.
