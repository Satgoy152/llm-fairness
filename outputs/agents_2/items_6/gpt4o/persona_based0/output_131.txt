Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  56  81  18  62  97
1  15  50  14  68  71  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [15 50 14 68 71 30]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution, where each agent values their allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent.

Let's consider the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as [96, 56, 81, 18, 62, 97].
- Agent 1 values the items as [15, 50, 14, 68, 71, 30].

A fair division often involves maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring that no agent envies another. We proceed by examining the highest valued items for each agent and attempting to allocate these items in a way that maximizes each agent's overall valuation.

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (97), Item 0 (96), Item 2 (81)
   
2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (71), Item 3 (68), Item 1 (50)

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- **Agent 0 gets items:** 0, 2, 5  
  (These items give Agent 0 a total value of 96 + 81 + 97 = 274)

- **Agent 1 gets items:** 1, 3, 4  
  (These items give Agent 1 a total value of 50 + 68 + 71 = 189)

This allocation ensures that both agents receive their highest valued items and the total value each agent receives is relatively balanced given their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
