Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2  3   4   5
0  51  99   0  3  48  53
1  39  87  64  1  10  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while prioritizing envy-freeness, we need to consider how each agent values the items and try to distribute them in a way that minimizes envy, ideally making each agent feel they have received a fair share based on their personal valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [51, 99, 0, 3, 48, 53]
- Agent 1's valuations: [39, 87, 64, 1, 10, 50]

The goal is to allocate items such that each agent feels they are getting a fair share based on their valuations. Let's break down the allocation:

1. **Item 1**: Both agents highly value item 1, but agent 0 values it slightly more (99 vs. 87). Allocating item 1 to agent 0 should significantly satisfy their valuation.
   
2. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values item 2 the most (64), and agent 0 values it as 0. To reduce envy, allocate item 2 to agent 1.

3. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values item 5 more than agent 1 (53 vs. 50). Allocating item 5 to agent 0 will satisfy them more.

4. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values item 4 significantly more than agent 1 (48 vs. 10). Allocate item 4 to agent 0.

5. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values item 3 slightly more than agent 0 (1 vs. 3). Given that agent 1 has fewer items at this point, allocate item 3 to agent 1.

6. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 more than agent 1 (51 vs. 39). Allocate item 0 to agent 0. 

Now, let's present the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent has received items that they highly value, and the distribution of items is as balanced as possible given their preferences.
