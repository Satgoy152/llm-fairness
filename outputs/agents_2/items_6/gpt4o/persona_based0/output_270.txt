Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  30  23   7  43  81
1  58  26   3  89  62  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any allocation received by the other agent. Let's evaluate the valuations and create an allocation strategy.

**Agent Valuations:**

- **Agent 0:**  
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 30
  - Item 2: 23
  - Item 3: 7
  - Item 4: 43
  - Item 5: 81

- **Agent 1:**  
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 1: 26
  - Item 2: 3
  - Item 3: 89
  - Item 4: 62
  - Item 5: 62

Let's start by identifying which items are highly valued by each agent and try to distribute them such that both agents feel satisfied with their allocations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 5 (81) and item 4 (43).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (89).

**Proposed Allocation:**

- Allocate item 5, item 0, and item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 3, item 4, and item 2 to Agent 1.

**Reasoning:**

- **Agent 0's Allocation:** Items 5, 0, 1
  - Total valuation: 81 (item 5) + 32 (item 0) + 30 (item 1) = 143

- **Agent 1's Allocation:** Items 3, 4, 2
  - Total valuation: 89 (item 3) + 62 (item 4) + 3 (item 2) = 154

Both agents have a high total valuation for their allocated items, and the difference in total valuation is not significant, reducing the likelihood of envy.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of the total value, considering their individual valuations of each item.
