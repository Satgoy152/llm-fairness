Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  90  83  16  17  58
1  28  71  30  81  63  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[86 90 83 16 17 58]
 [28 71 30 81 63 42]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the other agent's allocation. Given the valuation table:

Agent 0: [86, 90, 83, 16, 17, 58]  
Agent 1: [28, 71, 30, 81, 63, 42]  

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: \(86 + 90 + 83 + 16 + 17 + 58 = 350\)
- Total value for Agent 1: \(28 + 71 + 30 + 81 + 63 + 42 = 315\)

We need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they receive a fair share according to their valuations.

### Allocation Strategy

1. Prioritize allocating each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring no envy if possible.
2. Balance the value of allocations to approach fairness.

#### Steps:

- **Agent 0** values items [1, 0, 2] the most (with values 90, 86, 83).
- **Agent 1** values items [3, 4, 1] the most (with values 81, 63, 71).

To balance the allocation:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

#### Allocation Summary:

- **Agent 0**: Gets items [1, 0, 2] with total valuation of \(90 + 86 + 83 = 259\).
- **Agent 1**: Gets items [3, 4, 5] with total valuation of \(81 + 63 + 42 = 186\).

This allocation isn't envy-free, but it tries to balance the high-value items among the agents.

### Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items, attempting to balance the total value each receives based on their own valuations.
