Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0  1   2   3   4   5
0  91  3  67  42  19  46
1  87  8  76  32  32  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87  8 76 32 32 62]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free division if possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of goods received by the other agent over their own bundle. This can be complex, but we can attempt a heuristic approach to achieve a fair division.

Let's evaluate the valuations first:

- Agent 0's valuations: [91, 3, 67, 42, 19, 46]
- Agent 1's valuations: [87, 8, 76, 32, 32, 62]

We want to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation for their allocated items while trying to ensure fairness. A simple approach can be to allocate each item to the agent who values it more. Let's calculate which agent values each item more:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 at 87. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 3, Agent 1 at 8. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 67, Agent 1 at 76. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 at 32. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 at 32. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 46, Agent 1 at 62. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 4, and 5.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 a total valuation of 91 + 42 = 133
- Agent 1 a total valuation of 8 + 76 + 32 + 62 = 178

Although the total valuations are not equal, each item is allocated to the agent who values it more, which can be considered a fair division in terms of maximizing agents' satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
