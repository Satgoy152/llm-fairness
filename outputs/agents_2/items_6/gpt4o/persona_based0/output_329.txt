Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  67  34  43  63  93
1  55  23   7   7  36  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

First, let's sum up the total valuations of each agent for all items:

- Agent 0: 92 + 67 + 34 + 43 + 63 + 93 = 392
- Agent 1: 55 + 23 + 7 + 7 + 36 + 88 = 216

Next, we consider the allocation such that each agent's share corresponds as closely as possible to their proportion of the total valuation:

1. Total valuation for both agents combined: 392 + 216 = 608

2. Proportional share for each agent:
   - Agent 0's share of total valuation: 392 / 608 ≈ 64.47%
   - Agent 1's share of total valuation: 216 / 608 ≈ 35.53%

Now, we will allocate items to agents such that the value received by each agent is as close as possible to their proportional share.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. Assign high-value items to Agent 0 to match their higher total valuation proportion.
2. Assign remaining items to Agent 1, ensuring they get a fair total value.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 92, highest for Agent 0)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 93, second-highest for Agent 0)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 67, third-highest for Agent 0)

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 36, highest for Agent 1)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 7, second-highest for Agent 1)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 34, third-highest for Agent 0 but low for Agent 1)

**Valuation Check:**

- Total value for Agent 0: 92 + 93 + 67 = 252
- Total value for Agent 1: 36 + 7 + 34 = 77

**Proportional Check:**

- Proportional value for Agent 0: 252 / 392 ≈ 64.29% (close to 64.47%)
- Proportional value for Agent 1: 77 / 216 ≈ 35.65% (close to 35.53%)

This allocation respects the goal of dividing items in a manner close to the proportional valuations, ensuring a fair division.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, both agents receive items in a way that reflects their proportional valuation as closely as possible, which helps in achieving a fair and envy-free division.
