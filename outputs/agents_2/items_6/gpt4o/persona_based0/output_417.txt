Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  11  12  42  72   9
1  59  32  55  91  31  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we should aim to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value the allocation of the other agent. Given the valuations provided, we need to distribute the 6 items in such a way that both agents feel that their allocation is fair.

Let's first examine the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [17, 11, 12, 42, 72, 9]
- Agent 1's valuations: [59, 32, 55, 91, 31, 88]

To create a fair allocation, we can consider a possible way to allocate these items:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 highly (72), so we can consider allocating item 4 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 highly (91), so we can consider allocating item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 1 also values item 5 highly (88), so we can allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
4. Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0, 1, and 2.

We will try to balance the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can take item 2 (valued at 12 by Agent 0).
- Agent 0 can take item 0 (valued at 17 by Agent 0).
- Agent 1 can take item 1 (valued at 32 by Agent 1).

Let's check this allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 2, 4] with valuations [17, 12, 72]. Total valuation for Agent 0 = 101.
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 3, 5] with valuations [32, 91, 88]. Total valuation for Agent 1 = 211.

Although Agent 1 has a higher total valuation, each agent is receiving items they value highly, which should reduce envy.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
