Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  39  37  58  17  59
1  77  61  49  35   6  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the 6 items between the 2 agents such that we achieve a fair allocation, ideally minimizing envy or achieving envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the other agent's allocation.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: \(45 + 39 + 37 + 58 + 17 + 59 = 255\)
- Total value for Agent 1: \(77 + 61 + 49 + 35 + 6 + 46 = 274\)

Given these values, let's attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives an allocation they value highly.

### Allocation Attempt

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Highest valued items: 5 (59), 3 (58), 0 (45)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (77), 1 (61), 2 (49)

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 3, 5, 4
  - Value: \(58 (3) + 59 (5) + 17 (4) = 134\)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 0, 1, 2
  - Value: \(77 (0) + 61 (1) + 49 (2) = 187\)

### Analysis

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Values their own allocation at 134
  - Values Agent 1's allocation at \(45 (0) + 39 (1) + 37 (2) = 121\)
  - No envy as 134 > 121

- **Agent 1**:
  - Values their own allocation at 187
  - Values Agent 0's allocation at \(35 (3) + 46 (5) + 6 (4) = 87\)
  - No envy as 187 > 87

Both agents value their allocations higher than the other agent's allocation, suggesting this is an envy-free allocation.

### Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
