Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  31  86  52  17  87
1  36  92  42  39  45  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by the other agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations of the agents for each item, let's examine their preferences:

- Agent 0's valuations: [97, 31, 86, 52, 17, 87]
- Agent 1's valuations: [36, 92, 42, 39, 45, 30]

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 97 + 31 + 86 + 52 + 17 + 87 = 370
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 36 + 92 + 42 + 39 + 45 + 30 = 284

Next, we will allocate items to each agent by trying to balance the perceived value of each agent's bundle:

1. **Allocate item 0** to Agent 0: This item has the highest value for Agent 0 (97) and relatively low value for Agent 1 (36).
2. **Allocate item 1** to Agent 1: This item has the highest value for Agent 1 (92) and low value for Agent 0 (31).
3. **Allocate item 2** to Agent 0: This item has a high value for Agent 0 (86) and moderate value for Agent 1 (42).
4. **Allocate item 3** to Agent 1: This item has a moderate value for both agents, but slightly higher for Agent 1 (39) compared to Agent 0 (52).
5. **Allocate item 4** to Agent 1: This item has a higher value for Agent 1 (45) compared to Agent 0 (17).
6. **Allocate item 5** to Agent 0: This item has a high value for Agent 0 (87) compared to Agent 1 (30).

With this allocation, let's summarize the bundles:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 1 receives items: [1, 3, 4]

We now present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as envy-free as possible given the valuations and ensures that both agents receive a bundle they value highly according to their preferences.
