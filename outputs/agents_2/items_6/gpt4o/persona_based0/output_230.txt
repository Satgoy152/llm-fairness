Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43   7  63  19  40  30
1  89  88  58  47   1  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their individual valuations, a common approach is to minimize envy, aiming for an envy-free division if possible. Envy-freeness implies that each agent should value their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation, under their own valuation scale.

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(43 + 7 + 63 + 19 + 40 + 30 = 202\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(89 + 88 + 58 + 47 + 1 + 91 = 374\)

Now, to achieve a fair allocation, we can try to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

1. **Agent 1** highly values items 0, 1, and 5. Allocating these items to agent 1 might help balance the overall value they receive.
2. **Agent 0** highly values item 2. Allocating this item to agent 0 would maximize their utility for that item.

Now, let's consider the following allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 3, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 1, 5

Let's check the valuations for these allocations:

- **Agent 0's** valuation: \(63 + 19 + 40 = 122\)
- **Agent 1's** valuation: \(89 + 88 + 91 = 268\)

This allocation gives a fair division based on the valuation provided. Agent 1 receives a higher total valuation, but the allocation is structured to respect their preferences for high-value items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
