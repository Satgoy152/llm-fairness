Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  34  97  43  45  49
1  17  72   2  75  81   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels that they have received the best possible allocation given the circumstances. This involves an understanding of the relative valuations of each agent for each item.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 48
  - Item 1: 34
  - Item 2: 97
  - Item 3: 43
  - Item 4: 45
  - Item 5: 49

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 17
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 2
  - Item 3: 75
  - Item 4: 81
  - Item 5: 8

One effective method to ensure fairness is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's preferences, while ensuring that each agent's total valuation is as close as possible. 

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values Item 2 (97) and Item 5 (49).
   - Agent 1 highly values Item 4 (81) and Item 3 (75).

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 and Item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 and Item 5 to Agent 0.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are Item 0 and Item 1.
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 (48) more than Agent 1 (17), so allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 (72) more than Agent 0 (34), so allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 4]

This allocation is fair as it distributes the items based on each agent's preferences and ensures that each agent receives items they highly value.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
