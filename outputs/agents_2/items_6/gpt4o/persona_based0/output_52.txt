Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  26  63  87  25  94
1  28  70  43  95  47  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [28 70 43 95 47 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, which means each agent believes they have received at least as much value as the other agent has from their allocation.

Here is the valuation matrix for the two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1) and the six items:

```
    Items
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  26  63  87  25  94
1  28  70  43  95  47  44
```

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Determine which items each agent values highly.
2. **Allocate Items:** Assign items to ensure that both agents have a similar value from their allocated items.

Let's analyze the values:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest valued items: 5 (94), 0 (90), 3 (87)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest valued items: 3 (95), 1 (70), 4 (47)

A possible fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 0, 2, 5
  - Total value: 90 + 63 + 94 = 247

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 1, 3, 4
  - Total value: 70 + 95 + 47 = 212

Both agents get 3 items each, and the allocations are balanced in terms of the values they receive.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
