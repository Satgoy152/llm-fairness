Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  14  12  16  75  58
1  91  75  61   6  61  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 75 61  6 61 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim for an envy-free division where each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as the other agent's allocation. Here's how we can approach the problem:

First, let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [81, 14, 12, 16, 75, 58]
- Agent 1's valuations: [91, 75, 61, 6, 61, 87]

To achieve a fair allocation, we should aim to balance the total value each agent perceives from their allocation. We can calculate the total value each agent attributes to all items:

Total valuations:
- Agent 0: 81 + 14 + 12 + 16 + 75 + 58 = 256
- Agent 1: 91 + 75 + 61 + 6 + 61 + 87 = 381

Now, let's try to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

A potential allocation could be:
- Agent 0 receives items that are highly valued by Agent 0 and less valued by Agent 1.
- Agent 1 receives items that are highly valued by Agent 1 and less valued by Agent 0.

After some trial and error, the following allocation seems fair:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 91, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 81).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 75, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 14).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 61, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 12).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 16, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 6).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 75, which is equal to Agent 1's valuation of 61).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 58, which is lower than Agent 1's valuation of 87, but Agent 1 already has a high valuation total).

Now, let's check the total valuation each agent perceives from their allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 3, 4, 5:
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 16 + 75 + 58 = 149
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 6 + 61 + 87 = 154

- Agent 1 gets items 0, 1, 2:
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 91 + 75 + 61 = 227
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 81 + 14 + 12 = 107

This allocation provides a reasonably fair division based on the given valuations. Each agent values their allocation more than the other's allocation, which helps achieve a sense of fairness.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
