Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  84   4  42  39  77
1  48  90  81  15  42  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find a fair allocation of items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for the items. We can try to allocate the items such that each agent's total valuation for the items they receive is as balanced as possible.

Here's the breakdown of the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [15, 84, 4, 42, 39, 77]
- Agent 1's valuations: [48, 90, 81, 15, 42, 79]

First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 15 + 84 + 4 + 42 + 39 + 77 = 261
- Total value for Agent 1: 48 + 90 + 81 + 15 + 42 + 79 = 355

Next, we aim to allocate the items to balance the perceived value for each agent as closely as possible.

One possible allocation strategy is to assign items in a way that balances the total valuation per agent. Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (15 vs. 48)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (84 vs. 90)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (4 vs. 81)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (42 vs. 15)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (39 vs. 42)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (77 vs. 79)

With this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 4
  - Total value for Agent 0: 15 + 42 + 39 = 96
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 5
  - Total value for Agent 1: 90 + 81 + 79 = 250

The allocations are reasonably balanced given the constraints, and each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their perceived value without creating excessive envy. 

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
