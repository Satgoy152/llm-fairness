Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77   2  56  20   7  97
1  76  32  16  72  64   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we should consider principles like envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of the other agent over their own. We can approach the problem by looking at how each agent values each item and then allocating items to maximize each agent's total value, while keeping the allocation balanced.

Looking at the given valuations:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 77      | 76      |
| 1    | 2       | 32      |
| 2    | 56      | 16      |
| 3    | 20      | 72      |
| 4    | 7       | 64      |
| 5    | 97      | 7       |

We aim to allocate the items so that each agent is as satisfied as possible.

1. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values this the most (97 vs. 7), so allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0**: Agent 0 also values this highly (77 vs. 76), but the values are close. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 to balance the allocation.
3. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this much higher (72 vs. 20), so allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this higher (64 vs. 7), so allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this higher (56 vs. 16), so allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
6. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this higher (32 vs. 2), so allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

Given these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value highly while keeping the distribution fair and envy-free to the extent possible. Agent 0 receives items with a total value of 153, and Agent 1 receives items with a total value of 244.
