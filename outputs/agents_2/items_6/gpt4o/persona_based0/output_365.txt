Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2  3   4   5
0  13  42  61  7  58  25
1  85  26   8  6  87  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to evaluate the preferences of each agent for each item based on the values provided. Our goal is to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair, ideally minimizing envy between the agents.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [13, 42, 61, 7, 58, 25]
- Agent 1 values: [85, 26, 8, 6, 87, 24]

Let's analyze how to distribute these items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 85, which is substantially higher than Agent 0's valuation of 13. Thus, it seems reasonable to allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 42, while Agent 1 values it at 26. It's better to allocate this item to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 has a higher valuation of 61 compared to Agent 1's 8, so it makes sense to allocate it to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Both agents value this item low, but Agent 0 has a slightly higher valuation of 7 compared to Agent 1's 6. So, we allocate it to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 has a much higher valuation (87) compared to Agent 0's 58, so it should be allocated to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 25, slightly higher than Agent 1's 24, so it should go to Agent 0.

Based on these allocations, we attempt to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives items that they value relatively higher. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation takes into account the preferences of each agent, attempting to satisfy their valuations as much as possible while maintaining a fair division of items.
