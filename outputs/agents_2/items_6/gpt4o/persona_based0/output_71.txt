Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  82  95  90  10  35
1  39  88  40  16   0  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and a total of 6 items are allocated, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. This means each agent should, in principle, be at least as happy with their own allocation as they would be with the other agent's allocation, given their own valuations.

To proceed, we can calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to determine how valuable items are to each. Then, we can use a heuristic approach to allocate the items in a way that approximates fairness.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 51 + 82 + 95 + 90 + 10 + 35 = 363
- Agent 1's total valuation: 39 + 88 + 40 + 16 + 0 + 20 = 203

Agent 0 values the items significantly higher in total compared to Agent 1, so we should attempt to balance the allocation to prevent envy.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **High Valuation Items**: Start by allocating the items with the highest valuations for each agent.
2. **Balance the Allocation**: Ensure both agents are relatively happy with their allocations.

**Agent 0**: Highest value items for Agent 0 are items 2 (95), 3 (90), and 1 (82).
**Agent 1**: Highest value items for Agent 1 are items 1 (88), 2 (40), and 3 (16).

To ensure both agents are satisfied, we need to consider a balance that allows each agent to receive a portion of their highly valued items. Given the situation, a reasonable allocation might look like this:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 4, and 5.

This allocation gives each agent a mix of high-valued items from their perspective.

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives three items, utilizing all the available items while considering their valuations to maintain fairness as best as possible.
