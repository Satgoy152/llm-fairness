Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  75  34  11  99  40  98  66
1  61  25  57  26  57  57  70  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division as much as possible, given the constraints of integer allocations and the specific valuations.

Let's compute the total value each agent assigns to all items combined:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \( 82 + 75 + 34 + 11 + 99 + 40 + 98 + 66 = 505 \)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \( 61 + 25 + 57 + 26 + 57 + 57 + 70 + 61 = 414 \)

Next, we can use a method that attempts to balance the value each agent receives. In this case, since there are only two agents, we aim for a division where each agent values their allocation similarly, as much as possible. The goal is to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy between the two agents.

To find an approximately fair allocation, we can look for items where the valuation difference is largest and prioritize those for allocation. Here's a breakdown based on valuation differences:

1. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 at 57. Difference = 42
2. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 82, Agent 1 at 61. Difference = 21
3. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 at 70. Difference = 28
4. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 at 25. Difference = 50
5. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 at 61. Difference = 5
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 at 57. Difference = -17
7. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 at 57. Difference = -23
8. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 11, Agent 1 at 26. Difference = -15

Let's proceed to allocate items to minimize envy, considering each agent's highest value and balancing the total value received:

- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0
- Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0

- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1
- Allocate Item 7 to Agent 1

Now, let's check the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1, 4, 6]:
  - Total value for Agent 0: \( 82 + 75 + 99 + 98 = 354 \)

- Agent 1 receives items [2, 3, 5, 7]:
  - Total value for Agent 1: \( 57 + 26 + 57 + 61 = 201 \)

This allocation aims to balance the valuations while considering the differences in item value perception between the agents. Agent 0 receives more value, but this allocation reflects both agents' preferences given the constraint of whole item allocations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
