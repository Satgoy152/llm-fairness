Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  33  11  45  27  28  60  17
1  76  78  63   4  68  30   9   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents using principles of fair division and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method that attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives while trying to minimize any envy. One common approach in such scenarios is the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or simply using a greedy approach to maximize individual happiness while maintaining fairness.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 40 + 33 + 11 + 45 + 27 + 28 + 60 + 17 = 261
- Agent 1's total valuation: 76 + 78 + 63 + 4 + 68 + 30 + 9 + 7 = 335

To ensure a fair distribution, we want to allocate items such that the sum of the values of the allocated items is balanced between the two agents. A simple way to achieve this is to let each agent bid for items and allocate based on the highest bid, ensuring each agent gets a selection of items that maximizes their individual total value without creating excessive envy.

Let's allocate items by iterating through the list and giving each item to the agent who values it more, trying to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (76 vs. 40), assign to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (78 vs. 33), assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (63 vs. 11), assign to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (45 vs. 4), assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (68 vs. 27), assign to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (28 vs. 30), assign to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (60 vs. 9), assign to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (17 vs. 7), assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items: 3, 6, 7 (values: 45, 60, 17)
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 (values: 76, 78, 63, 68, 30)

Total value for Agent 0: 45 + 60 + 17 = 122
Total value for Agent 1: 76 + 78 + 63 + 68 + 30 = 315

Let's balance the allocation further:

Upon reviewing the allocation, it's clear that Agent 1 has significantly more value. We need to adjust this to make it more balanced. Let's swap some items between agents:

- Swap item 5 from Agent 1 to Agent 0.

Now the allocations are:

- Agent 0 gets items: 3, 5, 6, 7 (values: 45, 28, 60, 17)
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 1, 2, 4 (values: 76, 78, 63, 68)

Total value for Agent 0: 45 + 28 + 60 + 17 = 150
Total value for Agent 1: 76 + 78 + 63 + 68 = 285

The allocations are more balanced now, while still respecting individual item preferences.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```
