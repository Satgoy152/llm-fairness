Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  20  54  15  55  15  39  14
1  19  75  71  74  18  71  31  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while trying to achieve envy-freeness, we can employ a strategy that considers each agent's valuation of the items and aims to equalize the total value received by each agent as much as possible.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 19 + 20 + 54 + 15 + 55 + 15 + 39 + 14 = 231
- Agent 1's total valuation: 19 + 75 + 71 + 74 + 18 + 71 + 31 + 25 = 384

The goal is to allocate the items so that the total value received by each agent is as close as possible, considering their individual valuations.

Let's proceed with an allocation that aims to balance the valuations:

1. Assign the items with the highest individual valuations to each agent, alternating between agents to balance the total value.
2. Consider the next highest valued items for each agent to ensure neither is envious of the other's allocation.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 4, 5
  - Total value for Agent 0 = 54 + 55 + 15 = 124
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 6, 7, 0
  - Total value for Agent 1 = 75 + 74 + 31 + 25 + 19 = 224

Now let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 7, 0]
}
```

This allocation tries to distribute the items such that both agents have a fair share based on their valuations, given the constraints and the objective of achieving envy-freeness.
