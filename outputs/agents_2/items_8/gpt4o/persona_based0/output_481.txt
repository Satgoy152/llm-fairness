Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  87  90  38  39  79   7  52
1   4  27  40  19  97  49  16  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method that tries to balance the total valuations each agent receives. This means that each agent should perceive their allocation as at least as valuable as the other's, if possible.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 51 + 87 + 90 + 38 + 39 + 79 + 7 + 52 = 443
- Agent 1's total valuation: 4 + 27 + 40 + 19 + 97 + 49 + 16 + 60 = 312

Now, we aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible, while considering the individual preferences.

### Allocation Strategy

1. Start by giving each agent the item they value the most, if possible, without causing a large imbalance.
2. Then, allocate the remaining items to minimize any envy or imbalance.

#### Step-by-step Allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (90), and Agent 1 values item 4 the most (97). Give item 2 to Agent 0 and item 4 to Agent 1.
- Next, allocate items to balance total valuations:
  - Agent 0's items: [2] with total valuation 90
  - Agent 1's items: [4] with total valuation 97

- Consider the next highest preferences:
  - Agent 0: item 1 (87), item 5 (79)
  - Agent 1: item 7 (60), item 5 (49)
  
- Allocate items to balance valuations:
  - Give item 1 to Agent 0 and item 7 to Agent 1.
  - Agent 0's items: [2, 1] with total valuation 177
  - Agent 1's items: [4, 7] with total valuation 157

- Continue balancing:
  - Give item 5 to Agent 0 and item 3 to Agent 1.
  - Agent 0's items: [2, 1, 5] with total valuation 256
  - Agent 1's items: [4, 7, 3] with total valuation 176

- Distribute remaining items 0 and 6:
  - Give item 0 to Agent 0 and item 6 to Agent 1.
  - Agent 0's items: [2, 1, 5, 0] with total valuation 307
  - Agent 1's items: [4, 7, 3, 6] with total valuation 183

- Finally, allocate item 6 to Agent 1 to further balance:
  - Agent 0's items: [2, 1, 5, 0, 6] with total valuation 314
  - Agent 1's items: [4, 7, 3, 6] with total valuation 199

### Final Allocation

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 5, 0, 6],
    "1": [4, 7, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations for both agents while considering their preferences as much as possible.
