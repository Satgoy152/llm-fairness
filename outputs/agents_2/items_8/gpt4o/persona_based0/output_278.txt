Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  24  37  47  18  59  61  89
1  12  54   3  86  24  73  53  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the perceived fairness by minimizing envy. A common approach is to employ an envy-free allocation strategy, such as the adjusted winner procedure or the method of equalizing the marginal utility per item. However, given the simplicity of the scenario with two agents and eight items, we can try a direct allocation to ensure each agent perceives the allocation as fair based on their valuations.

Let's manually inspect the valuations and aim for an allocation where each agent feels that their bundle is at least as valuable as the other agent's bundle, based on their own valuations.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [25, 24, 37, 47, 18, 59, 61, 89]
- Agent 1: [12, 54, 3, 86, 24, 73, 53, 31]

### Total Value for Each Agent:
- Total value for Agent 0: 360
- Total value for Agent 1: 336

### Initial Allocation Strategy:
1. Allocate the highest valued item for each agent to them if possible.
2. Balance the allocation by trying to keep the total value perceived by each agent as equal as possible.

### Allocation Process:
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0, since it is the highest valued item for them.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, since it is the highest valued item for them.
- Continue assigning the next highest valued items, balancing the total perceived value.

#### Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 5, 6, 7]
  - Total perceived value for Agent 0: 25 + 59 + 61 + 89 = 234
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 4]
  - Total perceived value for Agent 1: 54 + 3 + 86 + 24 = 167

After manually verifying, this allocation tries to balance the perceived values, avoiding significant envy between the agents. Each agent receives four items, and the allocation is complete.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair number of items, with an effort to minimize envy based on their individual valuations.
