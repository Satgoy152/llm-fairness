Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  94  75  12   1  54   0  64
1  13  12  36  82  77  47  79  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as envy-free as possible, given the integer constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by the other agent over their own bundle.

First, let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(1 + 94 + 75 + 12 + 1 + 54 + 0 + 64 = 301\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(13 + 12 + 36 + 82 + 77 + 47 + 79 + 79 = 425\)

Next, we will try to allocate the items in a way that balances the total valuation each agent receives, aiming for each agent to get as close as possible to half of the total valuation.

The total valuation of all items is \(301 + 425 = 726\).
Half of this total valuation is \(363\).

Let's begin by allocating high-value items to achieve a balanced distribution:

1. **Agent 1** values item 3 very highly (82), which is much higher than Agent 0's valuation (12). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 1** values items 4 (77) and 6 (79) highly as well, more than Agent 0 does. Assign items 4 and 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** values item 1 very highly (94), while Agent 1 values it only at 12. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 0** values item 2 highly (75), which is higher than Agent 1's valuation (36). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 1** values item 7 highly (79), more than Agent 0 (64). Assign item 7 to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the remaining items: 0, 5.

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 1, Agent 1 values at 13.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values at 54, Agent 1 values at 47.

The current allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2 (Valuation: 94 + 75 = 169)
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 6, 7 (Valuation: 82 + 77 + 79 + 79 = 317)

Remaining items are 0 and 5. To balance the valuations further:

6. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 for a higher valuation (54 vs. 47).
7. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 since they value it higher (13 vs. 1).

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 4, 6, 7

Valuations:

- Agent 0: 94 + 75 + 54 = 223
- Agent 1: 13 + 82 + 77 + 79 + 79 = 330

The allocation is balanced as possible given the constraints.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
