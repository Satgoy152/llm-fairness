Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0  1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  8  13  54  17  13  70  71
1  81  2  90  10  56  16  63   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to potentially achieving an envy-free allocation:

1. **Analyze Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values items as follows: [93, 8, 13, 54, 17, 13, 70, 71]
   - Agent 1 values items as follows: [81, 2, 90, 10, 56, 16, 63, 3]

2. **Initial High-Value Item Assignment:**
   - Assign high-value items to each agent initially based on their highest valuations to reduce envy. 

3. **Assign Items:**
   - Agent 0: Assign item 0 (value 93) and item 7 (value 71) to agent 0 as they are the highest valued items for agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Assign item 2 (value 90) and item 4 (value 56) to agent 1 as they are the highest valued items for agent 1.

4. **Balance Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items to allocate: [1, 3, 5, 6]
   - Agent 0's next highest values are for items 6 (value 70) and 3 (value 54).
   - Agent 1's next highest values are for items 6 (value 63) and 5 (value 16).

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Assign item 6 to agent 0 since it has a higher relative value for agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 0 as it has a higher relative value than other remaining items.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 1.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 1 to balance the number of items.

By following this approach, we ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while distributing all items.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
