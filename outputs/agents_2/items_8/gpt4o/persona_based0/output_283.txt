Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0  1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  0  18  10   1  83  40  54
1  77  0  89  57  80  43  94  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. We can use the method of maximum total valuation to allocate the items, which often helps in achieving a fair division.

The goal here is to allocate items so that each agent values their bundle of items as fairly as possible. We can start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 49 + 0 + 18 + 10 + 1 + 83 + 40 + 54 = 255
- Agent 1's total valuation: 77 + 0 + 89 + 57 + 80 + 43 + 94 + 75 = 515

Given that Agent 1 has a higher total valuation, we aim to allocate items such that the total value each agent gets is as equal as possible in proportion to their respective total valuations.

### Allocation Strategy

1. Start by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent in proportion to their total valuations.
2. Check if any reallocations can reduce envy or improve fairness.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Agent 0 has higher valuations on items: 0, 5, 7 (49, 83, 54)
- Agent 1 has higher valuations on items: 2, 3, 4, 6 (89, 57, 80, 94)

Assign these high-value items to their respective agents. This leaves us with items that can help balance the total valuation each agent receives.

### Initial Allocation
- Agent 0: [0, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: [2, 3, 4, 6]

### Calculate Remaining Items
The remaining item is 1, which both agents value at 0. To ensure all items are allocated, we can assign it arbitrarily without affecting fairness.

### Final Allocation
Given the preference, we assign item 1 to Agent 0 since they have fewer items.

### Resulting Allocation in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value received by each agent, considering their respective valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
