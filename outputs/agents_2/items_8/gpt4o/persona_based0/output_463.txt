Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  25  91  22   4  92  94  97
1   3  33   0  74  23  47  77  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, a common approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels that they have received a bundle of items that is at least as valuable as the bundle received by the other agent. Given the valuations provided, let's find an allocation that minimizes envy and attempts to balance the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations.

The valuation matrix is as follows:

```
Agent 0: [63, 25, 91, 22, 4, 92, 94, 97]
Agent 1: [3, 33, 0, 74, 23, 47, 77, 68]
```

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 488
- Total value for Agent 1: 325

Given these valuations, we'll try to allocate items to balance these totals and minimize envy. We will focus on giving each agent their higher-valued items while ensuring both agents feel they have a fair share. A balanced allocation can be achieved by the following steps:

1. Allocate items with the highest valuations from each agent's perspective.
2. Ensure each agent has a similar perceived value, balancing their respective totals.

Here is a fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 4, 7

This allocation can be summarized in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Agent 0 receives items that maximize their valuation, while Agent 1 receives items that optimize their perceived value, aiming for an envy-free distribution.
