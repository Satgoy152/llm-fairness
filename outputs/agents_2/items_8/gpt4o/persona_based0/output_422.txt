Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  74  28  68  26  76  27  39
1  51  73  71  34  56  87  71  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim for a distribution where each agent receives a bundle of items such that both agents have equal or as close to equal total valuation for their respective bundles. This will help achieve a fair division, potentially minimizing envy between agents.

Let's calculate the total valuations for different combinations and try to balance them:

### Initial Valuations:
- Agent 0: [61, 74, 28, 68, 26, 76, 27, 39]
- Agent 1: [51, 73, 71, 34, 56, 87, 71, 30]

### Total Valuation for Each Agent:
- Total for Agent 0: 61 + 74 + 28 + 68 + 26 + 76 + 27 + 39 = 399
- Total for Agent 1: 51 + 73 + 71 + 34 + 56 + 87 + 71 + 30 = 473

### Fair Allocation Strategy
1. We want to balance the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items.
2. We should strive for an allocation that minimizes the difference in total valuation between the two agents.

### Allocation Process:
1. Sort items based on the difference in valuations between the agents.
2. Allocate items to the agent who values it more, considering the goal to balance total valuations.

### Sorted Items Based on Valuation Difference:
- Item 5: Agent 1 (87) vs Agent 0 (76) -> Difference: 11
- Item 6: Agent 1 (71) vs Agent 0 (27) -> Difference: 44
- Item 2: Agent 1 (71) vs Agent 0 (28) -> Difference: 43
- Item 3: Agent 0 (68) vs Agent 1 (34) -> Difference: 34
- Item 7: Agent 0 (39) vs Agent 1 (30) -> Difference: 9
- Item 1: Agent 0 (74) vs Agent 1 (73) -> Difference: 1
- Item 4: Agent 1 (56) vs Agent 0 (26) -> Difference: 30
- Item 0: Agent 0 (61) vs Agent 1 (51) -> Difference: 10

### Allocating Items:
- Items 5, 6, and 2 to Agent 1 based on high value difference.
- Items 3, 0, 1 to Agent 0 to balance total valuation.
- Distribute remaining items (Item 7 and 4) considering overall balance.

### Final Allocation:
After testing different allocations, a fair distribution that closely balances total valuations is:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3, 7]
  - Total Valuation for Agent 0: 61 + 74 + 68 + 39 = 242
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4, 5, 6]
  - Total Valuation for Agent 1: 71 + 56 + 87 + 71 = 285

This allocation minimizes envy and fairly distributes the items based on the given valuations.

### Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 6]
}
