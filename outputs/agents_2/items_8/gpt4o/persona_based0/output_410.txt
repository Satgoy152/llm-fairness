Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  66  51  86  49  59  69  78
1  11  50  37  26  18  41  71  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to minimize envy by trying to equalize the perceived value of the allocation for each agent.

Here's the breakdown of steps and considerations for solving this problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: \(76 + 66 + 51 + 86 + 49 + 59 + 69 + 78 = 534\)
   - Agent 1: \(11 + 50 + 37 + 26 + 18 + 41 + 71 + 20 = 274\)

2. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0 values items 3 and 7 the most highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the most highly.

3. **Initial Allocation Strategy**:
   - Allocate items based on the highest relative value for each agent, while ensuring that the total value of items is balanced between the agents to the extent possible.

4. **Allocate Items**:
   - Assign items 3, 0, 1, and 7 to Agent 0 since these items are among the highest valued by Agent 0.
   - Assign items 6, 2, 5, and 4 to Agent 1 as these items have relatively higher values for Agent 1 compared to Agent 0.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Recheck each allocation to ensure that neither agent would prefer the other's allocation over their own.

Given these considerations, the final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the value each agent receives based on their own preferences, thus aiming to achieve an envy-free outcome.
