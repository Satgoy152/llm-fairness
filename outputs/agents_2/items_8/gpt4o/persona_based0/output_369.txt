Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  19  82  75  47  15  22  43
1  65  95  64  97  81  63  40   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. Envy-freeness ensures that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation given to the other agent.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0's total valuation**: 7 + 19 + 82 + 75 + 47 + 15 + 22 + 43 = 310
- **Agent 1's total valuation**: 65 + 95 + 64 + 97 + 81 + 63 + 40 + 2 = 507

The goal is to divide the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share.

To start, let's consider allocating items in a manner that balances the total valuation for each agent as closely as possible:

1. **Allocations for Agent 0**:
   - Items: 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Valuation: 82 + 75 + 47 + 15 = 219

2. **Allocations for Agent 1**:
   - Items: 0, 1, 6, 7
   - Valuation: 65 + 95 + 40 + 2 = 202

Now let's check if this allocation is envy-free:

- Agent 0 values their allocation (219) higher than the valuation they would have for Agent 1's allocation (7 + 19 + 22 + 43 = 91).
- Agent 1 values their allocation (202) higher than the valuation they would have for Agent 0's allocation (64 + 97 + 81 + 63 = 305).

This allocation isn't envy-free for Agent 1, as they would prefer Agent 0's allocation. Let's adjust the allocation to ensure envy-freeness:

1. **Revised Allocations for Agent 0**:
   - Items: 1, 2, 5, 7
   - Valuation: 19 + 82 + 15 + 43 = 159

2. **Revised Allocations for Agent 1**:
   - Items: 0, 3, 4, 6
   - Valuation: 65 + 97 + 81 + 40 = 283

Check for envy:

- Agent 0 values their allocation (159) higher than Agent 1's (7 + 75 + 47 + 22 = 151).
- Agent 1 values their allocation (283) higher than Agent 0's (95 + 64 + 63 + 2 = 224).

With this allocation, each agent is receiving a set of items they value more than what they would value the other's allocation, ensuring envy-freeness.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
