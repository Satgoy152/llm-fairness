Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  39  47  62  96  20  39  59
1  41  40  80  60  17   6  64  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy by considering each agent's valuations of the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair or at least not worse than the other agent's allocation in terms of value.

We will consider the following steps for the allocation:

1. **Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items**:
   - Agent 0: 48 + 39 + 47 + 62 + 96 + 20 + 39 + 59 = 410
   - Agent 1: 41 + 40 + 80 + 60 + 17 + 6 + 64 + 23 = 331

2. **Identify items with the highest valuation for each agent to prioritize their allocation**:
   - Agent 0's highest valued items: 4 (96), 3 (62), 7 (59), 0 (48)
   - Agent 1's highest valued items: 2 (80), 6 (64), 3 (60), 0 (41)

3. **Allocate items to minimize envy and distribute value relatively equally**:
   - Start by allocating items that are distinctly higher in value for one agent over the other.

4. **Proposed Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3, 4]
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 5, 6, 7]

5. **Verify the allocation**:
   - Agent 0's total value: 48 (Item 0) + 39 (Item 1) + 62 (Item 3) + 96 (Item 4) = 245
   - Agent 1's total value: 80 (Item 2) + 6 (Item 5) + 64 (Item 6) + 23 (Item 7) = 173

By this allocation, we attempt to balance the total values each agent receives while considering their preferences for specific items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all 8 items are distributed between the two agents.
