Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  99  59  26   8  98  27  81
1  22  14  90  29  81  37  11  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents while ensuring the allocation is envy-free, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Our goal is to distribute the items such that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's evaluate the agents' valuations and try to distribute the items to achieve envy-freeness:

### Agent 0's Valuations:
- Item 0: 10
- Item 1: 99
- Item 2: 59
- Item 3: 26
- Item 4: 8
- Item 5: 98
- Item 6: 27
- Item 7: 81

### Agent 1's Valuations:
- Item 0: 22
- Item 1: 14
- Item 2: 90
- Item 3: 29
- Item 4: 81
- Item 5: 37
- Item 6: 11
- Item 7: 88

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Start by identifying items that each agent values highly.
   
2. **Divide Items to Maximize Total Valuation for Each Agent:** Allocate items to each agent to ensure they receive the highest possible total value from their allocation.

### Allocation Process:
- **Agent 0** highly values items 1, 5, and 7.
- **Agent 1** highly values items 2, 4, and 7.

To ensure fairness and envy-freeness, let's allocate the items by balancing the total valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 1, 5, 6
  - Total Valuation = 10 + 99 + 98 + 27 = 234

- **Agent 1:** Items 2, 3, 4, 7
  - Total Valuation = 90 + 29 + 81 + 88 = 288

While the total valuations are not exactly equal, this allocation attempts to balance the high-value items between the agents, aiming for fairness by avoiding significant envy. 

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

These allocations ensure that both agents receive a balanced set of items based on their valuations, which should minimize envy and ensure a fair distribution.
