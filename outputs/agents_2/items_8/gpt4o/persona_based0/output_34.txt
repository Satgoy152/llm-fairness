Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  78  87  60   6  94  31  11
1  21  21  12  19  95   2  20  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [21 21 12 19 95  2 20 77]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we aim to allocate items such that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent. We will analyze the valuations to find a suitable allocation.

### Valuations Matrix

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 27      | 21      |
| 1    | 78      | 21      |
| 2    | 87      | 12      |
| 3    | 60      | 19      |
| 4    | 6       | 95      |
| 5    | 94      | 2       |
| 6    | 31      | 20      |
| 7    | 11      | 77      |

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify High Valuation Items**: 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items: 1, 2, 5.
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items: 4, 7.

2. **Allocate High Valuation Items**:
   - Assign items 1, 2, 5 to Agent 0, as they have significantly higher valuations for these items.
   - Assign items 4, 7 to Agent 1, as they have significantly higher valuations for these items.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Remaining items: 0, 3, 6.
   - Distribute items to balance total valuation:
     - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (27 vs. 21).
     - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (60 vs. 19).
     - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (20 vs. 31).

### Final Allocation

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 5
- Agent 1: Items 4, 6, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also attempting to balance the total value of allocations to each agent.

### JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [4, 6, 7]
}
