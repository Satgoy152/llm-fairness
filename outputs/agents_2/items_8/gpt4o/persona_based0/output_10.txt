Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  32  98  90  53  13  70   5
1  37  63   7   0  40  25  14  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy between agents, ideally achieving envy-freeness if possible. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [30, 32, 98, 90, 53, 13, 70, 5]
- Agent 1: [37, 63, 7, 0, 40, 25, 14, 99]

To approach this, one common method is to attempt to equalize the total valuation each agent has for their allocated items, considering agents' preferences.

Let's calculate an initial fair division of these items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Prefers items with higher valuations: Items 2 (98), 3 (90), 6 (70)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Prefers items with higher valuations: Items 7 (99), 1 (63)

Considering the valuations and respecting each agent's highest preferences, we can allocate as follows to minimize envy:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 6] (valuations: 98, 90, 70) → Total valuation = 258
- Agent 1: Items [7, 1, 0, 4, 5] (valuations: 99, 63, 37, 40, 25) → Total valuation = 264

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives as closely as possible. The items are distributed such that each agent receives items they highly value.

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [7, 1, 0, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed, with each agent getting an integer number of items.
