Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  24   4  90  96  79  94  41
1  36  19  17   2   2  10  77  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring a fair division, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to achieve an allocation where each agent perceives their bundle to be at least as valuable as the other agent's bundle, if possible, or to minimize envy as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 25  
- Item 1: 24  
- Item 2: 4  
- Item 3: 90  
- Item 4: 96  
- Item 5: 79  
- Item 6: 94  
- Item 7: 41  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 36  
- Item 1: 19  
- Item 2: 17  
- Item 3: 2  
- Item 4: 2  
- Item 5: 10  
- Item 6: 77  
- Item 7: 56  

To achieve a fair division, we aim to allocate items based on the relative preferences of the agents. We'll consider the highest valued items for each agent and try to balance the total value perceived by each agent.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 3, 4, 6.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 0, 6, 7.

2. **Possible Allocation:**
   - Assign items that are distinctly higher valued by one agent compared to the other where possible.

3. **Balancing the allocation:**
   - Allocate items to ensure that the total value perceived by each agent is as close as possible while ensuring that all items are distributed.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Assign items 3, 4, 5. (Total valuation = 90 + 96 + 79 = 265)
- **Agent 1:** Assign items 0, 1, 2, 6, 7. (Total valuation = 36 + 19 + 17 + 77 + 56 = 205)

This allocation considers the high-value items for each agent and tries to minimize envy by balancing the total perceived value.

### Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
