Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  78  15  20  89  40  11  13
1  43  29   5  50   4   5  46  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy by taking into account each agent's valuations of the items. One possible approach is to use the notion of "envy-freeness," which ensures that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent.

Let's assess the total value each agent perceives for all items:

- Agent 0's total value for all items: 34 + 78 + 15 + 20 + 89 + 40 + 11 + 13 = 300
- Agent 1's total value for all items: 43 + 29 + 5 + 50 + 4 + 5 + 46 + 48 = 230

To create a fair allocation, we can aim to divide the items such that each agent receives a similar portion of their total perceived value.

Given that we have two agents and eight items, each agent should ideally receive 4 items. Let's allocate items based on maximizing the perceived value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with higher valuations for Agent 0. Based on the table, items with the highest value for Agent 0 are items 4, 1, 0, and 5.

2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with higher valuations for Agent 1 from the remaining items. Based on the table, items with the highest value for Agent 1 are items 3, 7, 6, and 2.

Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 1, 0, 5] with values [89, 78, 34, 40] = 241
- Agent 1: Items [3, 7, 6, 2] with values [50, 48, 46, 5] = 149

This allocation maximizes each agent's perceived value from their allocation while ensuring that each agent receives exactly 4 items. The allocation also minimizes potential envy, as each agent receives items they highly value.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 0, 5],
    "1": [3, 7, 6, 2]
}
```
