Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  70  64  32  93  47  34  50
1  14   7  86  80  29  13  85  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair allocation of the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. One common approach to approximate envy-freeness is to use the adjusted winner procedure or other similar methods. However, given the simplicity of this problem (only two agents), we can manually calculate a fair division.

Letâ€™s first summarize the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 94 + 70 + 64 + 32 + 93 + 47 + 34 + 50 = 484
- Agent 1: 14 + 7 + 86 + 80 + 29 + 13 + 85 + 99 = 413

The goal is to allocate the items such that both agents feel they have received a fair share based on their valuations. A practical way to do this is to allocate items by maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that neither agent envies the other. 

### Allocation Process:

1. **Initial Allocation by Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, when possible.

2. **Adjust to Ensure Fairness:**
   - Balance the allocation such that each agent has roughly equal total value from their perspective.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 94, Agent 1 at 14. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 at 7. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 at 86. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 at 80. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 at 29. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 at 13. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 6:** Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 at 85. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 at 99. Allocate to Agent 1.

### Resulting Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 1, 4, 5]
- **Agent 1:** Items [2, 3, 6, 7]

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 a total valuation of: 94 + 70 + 93 + 47 = 304
- Agent 1 a total valuation of: 86 + 80 + 85 + 99 = 350

Both agents receive a substantial value from their perspective, and the allocation attempts to minimize envy by balancing value fairly across the agents.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items based on their valuations.
