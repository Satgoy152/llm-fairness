Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  42  12  24  77  66  33  79
1  95  71  93  50  60  29  81  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent perceives for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 50 + 42 + 12 + 24 + 77 + 66 + 33 + 79 = 383
- Agent 1's total valuation: 95 + 71 + 93 + 50 + 60 + 29 + 81 + 44 = 523

The goal is to allocate items such that each agent receives approximately half of the total value they perceive, which would be:

- Agent 0's target value: 383 / 2 = 191.5
- Agent 1's target value: 523 / 2 = 261.5

We'll distribute the items while trying to meet these target values as closely as possible:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 7: 79 (current total: 79/191.5)
   - Item 4: 77 (current total: 156/191.5)
   - Item 5: 66 (current total: 222/191.5)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0: 95 (current total: 95/261.5)
   - Item 2: 93 (current total: 188/261.5)
   - Item 6: 81 (current total: 269/261.5)

At this point, Agent 0 has received 3 items worth a total of 222, and Agent 1 has received 3 items worth a total of 269. We have 2 items left (1 and 3) to allocate:

3. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 1: 42 (current total: 264/191.5)

4. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3: 50 (current total: 319/261.5)

Now both agents have received 4 items each.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the valuations each agent receives, minimizing potential envy between them.
