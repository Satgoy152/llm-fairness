Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  50  42  28  26  13  93  81
1  84  22  40  51  21  65  98  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents and aim for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items and then aim to balance this distribution:

**Agent 0's Valuations:**
- Item 0: 36
- Item 1: 50
- Item 2: 42
- Item 3: 28
- Item 4: 26
- Item 5: 13
- Item 6: 93
- Item 7: 81
- **Total Value for Agent 0:** 369

**Agent 1's Valuations:**
- Item 0: 84
- Item 1: 22
- Item 2: 40
- Item 3: 51
- Item 4: 21
- Item 5: 65
- Item 6: 98
- Item 7: 31
- **Total Value for Agent 1:** 412

Next, let's try to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. We aim to make sure that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is as close as possible to half of their total valuation.

**Allocation Strategy:**
1. Assign items with the highest valuation differences first, as these are often critical to achieving envy-freeness.
2. Consider each agent's highest valued items and try to balance the perceived values.

**Proposed Allocation:**
- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 6, 7, 0, 4
  
- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 1, 2, 3, 5

**Verification of Allocations:**
- **Agent 0's Allocated Value:** 93 (Item 6) + 81 (Item 7) + 36 (Item 0) + 26 (Item 4) = 236
- **Agent 1's Allocated Value:** 22 (Item 1) + 40 (Item 2) + 51 (Item 3) + 65 (Item 5) = 178

The allocations are rounded to ensure that each agent gets four items, as there are eight items in total. The aim was to distribute the items such that the perceived value of each allocation is as balanced as possible.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format:**
```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations and keeps the allocation as envy-free as possible given the constraint of integer item allocations.
