Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  78  67  52  56  19  83   3
1  31  11  15  82  12  91  56  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the two agents, we can use a method that considers both the total value each agent assigns to the items and strives to maintain envy-freeness. One common method for fair division is the maximum Nash welfare method, which aims to maximize the product of the utilities of the agents. However, since this is a simple two-agent scenario, we can aim for a division that ensures no agent envies the other's allocation.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Value
First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0**: \(10 + 78 + 67 + 52 + 56 + 19 + 83 + 3 = 368\)
- **Agent 1**: \(31 + 11 + 15 + 82 + 12 + 91 + 56 + 22 = 320\)

### Step 2: Allocate Items
To ensure each agent gets items they value highly, we start by assigning items based on their highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0's highest values**: Item 6 (83), Item 1 (78), Item 2 (67)
2. **Agent 1's highest values**: Item 5 (91), Item 3 (82), Item 6 (56)

Now, distribute the items such that each agent's total value is as equal as possible, and they do not envy each other:

- **Allocate to Agent 0**: Items 1, 2, 6
  - Total value for Agent 0: \(78 + 67 + 83 = 228\)

- **Allocate to Agent 1**: Items 5, 3
  - Total value for Agent 1: \(91 + 82 = 173\)

Continue to allocate the remaining items to balance the values:

- **Remaining Items**: 0, 4, 7

### Step 3: Complete Allocation
Allocate the remaining items by considering minimizing envy:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 1

This results in:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 2, 6, 4]
  - Total value: \(78 + 67 + 83 + 56 = 284\)

- **Agent 1**: Items [5, 3, 0, 7]
  - Total value: \(91 + 82 + 31 + 22 = 226\)

### Final Allocation
The allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives and minimize envy.

{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
