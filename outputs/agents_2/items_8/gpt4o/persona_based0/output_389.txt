Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  19  56  35  77  14  68  33
1  14   8  55  74   7  24  65   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [14  8 55 74  7 24 65  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve a division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

First, we calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(66 + 19 + 56 + 35 + 77 + 14 + 68 + 33 = 368\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(14 + 8 + 55 + 74 + 7 + 24 + 65 + 8 = 255\)

Next, we attempt to allocate items in a way that balances these valuations. A naive approach is to allocate items that are of higher value to a particular agent than to the other, aiming to equalize the total perceived value each agent receives.

Let's analyze each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (66 vs. 14).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (19 vs. 8).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it slightly more (56 vs. 55).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (74 vs. 35).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (77 vs. 7).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (24 vs. 14).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (68 vs. 65).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (33 vs. 8).

Based on these observations, a fair allocation can be:

- Assign items 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 3 and 5 to Agent 1.

Now, let's verify the perceived value for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0's allocated items: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7. Total perceived value: \(66 + 19 + 56 + 77 + 68 + 33 = 319\).
- Agent 1's allocated items: 3, 5. Total perceived value: \(74 + 24 = 98\).

This allocation isn't perfectly balanced, but it respects the preferences where possible and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 5]
}
```
