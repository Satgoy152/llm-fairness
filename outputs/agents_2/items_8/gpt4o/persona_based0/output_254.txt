Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  73  93  86  34   0  22  27
1  14  38  73  85  53  60  63  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. Our goal is to allocate the items such that the agents feel they have received a fair share based on their valuation, ideally minimizing envy between the agents.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 65 + 73 + 93 + 86 + 34 + 0 + 22 + 27 = 400
- Agent 1's total valuation: 14 + 38 + 73 + 85 + 53 + 60 + 63 + 76 = 462

We aim to split these items in a way that is fair or close to proportional based on their valuations. A simple way to start is by checking the highest valuations and seeing if we can allocate items to balance the value each agent gets.

Given these valuations, let's allocate items as follows:

1. Sort items by the difference in agents' valuations (Agent 0's valuation - Agent 1's valuation):
   - Item 0: 65 - 14 = 51
   - Item 1: 73 - 38 = 35
   - Item 2: 93 - 73 = 20
   - Item 3: 86 - 85 = 1
   - Item 4: 34 - 53 = -19
   - Item 5: 0 - 60 = -60
   - Item 6: 22 - 63 = -41
   - Item 7: 27 - 76 = -49

2. Allocate items to agents based on who values them more:
   - Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, 2, 3
   - Agent 1 gets items 4, 5, 6, 7

Let's check the total value each agent receives with this allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2, 3
  - Total value: 65 + 73 + 93 + 86 = 317
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5, 6, 7
  - Total value: 53 + 60 + 63 + 76 = 252

Although the total values are not identical, the allocation respects each agent's preferences by giving them items they value more than the other agent, thus minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
