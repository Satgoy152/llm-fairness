Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  85  19  13   4  88  27  67
1  99  37  81  13  30  59  88  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 37 81 13 30 59 88 25]]
Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly while aiming for envy-freeness, we first need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate items in a way that neither agent envies the other.

Here are the valuations:

Agent 0: [21, 85, 19, 13, 4, 88, 27, 67]  
Agent 1: [99, 37, 81, 13, 30, 59, 88, 25]

One common approach to ensure that allocations are envy-free is to use a method that allows each agent to get items they highly value. We will try to ensure that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Highest values are for items 5 (88), 1 (85), and 7 (67).
   - Agent 1: Highest values are for items 0 (99), 2 (81), and 6 (88).

2. **Allocate High-Value Items:**
   - Give Agent 0 items 5, 1, and 7.
   - Give Agent 1 items 0, 2, and 6.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are 3 and 4.
   - Agent 0 values item 3 slightly higher than Agent 1 does. Therefore, assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign the last remaining item, item 4, to Agent 1.

### Calculated Allocations:
- **Agent 0:** Items 5, 1, 7, 3. Total value: 85 + 88 + 67 + 13 = 253.
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 2, 6, 4. Total value: 99 + 81 + 88 + 30 = 298.

These allocations are designed to minimize potential envy by ensuring each agent gets a significant portion of their highest-valued items and a balanced total valuation.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 7, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 6, 4]
}
```
