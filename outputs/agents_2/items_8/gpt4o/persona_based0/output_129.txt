Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  29  29  28  91  86  89  17
1  73  52   7  11  79  51  62  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to minimize envy by ensuring each agent feels they received at least as much value as the other agent based on their own valuations.

Let's take a step-by-step approach to allocate these items:

1. **List the items and their valuations for each agent:**

   - Agent 0: [81, 29, 29, 28, 91, 86, 89, 17]
   - Agent 1: [73, 52, 7, 11, 79, 51, 62, 97]

2. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**

   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 (81), 4 (91), 5 (86), and 6 (89).
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 7 (97), 0 (73), 4 (79), and 6 (62).

3. **Allocate the highest priority items to each agent based on their valuations:**

   - Start by allocating the highest value item for each agent:
     - Agent 0: Item 4 (value 91)
     - Agent 1: Item 7 (value 97)

4. **Continue allocation by alternating between agents to achieve fairness:**

   - Agent 0: Next highest items 6 (value 89), 5 (value 86)
   - Agent 1: Next highest items 0 (value 73), 4 (value 79)

5. **Re-evaluate remaining items based on minimizing envy:**

   - Remaining items are 1, 2, 3.
   - Agent 0 prefers item 1 (value 29) and item 2 (value 29).
   - Agent 1 prefers item 1 (value 52) and item 3 (value 11).

6. **Final allocation:**

   - Agent 0: Items [4, 6, 5, 3]
   - Agent 1: Items [7, 0, 1, 2]

By this allocation, we ensure that both agents receive items they highly value and minimize the potential for envy.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 5, 3],
    "1": [7, 0, 1, 2]
}
```
