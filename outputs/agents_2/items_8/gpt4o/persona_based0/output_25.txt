Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  42  81  92  71  42  39  42
1  29  14   2  81  62  86  35  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. One approach to achieve this is to use the Envy-Free (EF) criterion, ensuring that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent derives from all items:

- Agent 0: 67 + 42 + 81 + 92 + 71 + 42 + 39 + 42 = 476
- Agent 1: 29 + 14 + 2 + 81 + 62 + 86 + 35 + 24 = 333

To create a fair allocation, we aim to divide these items such that each agent receives a similar proportion of their total valuation. Here are the steps to achieve an envy-free allocation:

1. Calculate the proportional share for each agent:
   - Proportional share for Agent 0: 476 / 2 = 238
   - Proportional share for Agent 1: 333 / 2 = 166.5

2. Allocate items to each agent to get as close as possible to their proportional share.

Let's assign the items:

- Start by assigning items with the highest valuation for each agent until their proportional share is met or exceeded.

For Agent 0:
- Choose items with the highest value for Agent 0 until reaching about 238.
  - Item 3: 92
  - Item 2: 81
  - Item 4: 71

  Sum: 92 + 81 + 71 = 244 (closest to 238)

For Agent 1:
- Choose items with the highest value for Agent 1 until reaching about 166.5.
  - Item 5: 86
  - Item 3: 81

  Sum: 86 + 81 = 167 (closest to 166.5)

At this point, items 0, 1, 6, and 7 are unallocated. Since Agent 0 has already slightly exceeded their proportional share, these remaining items should be allocated to Agent 1 to potentially balance out envy.

Allocate the remaining items to Agent 1:
- Item 0: 29
- Item 1: 14
- Item 6: 35
- Item 7: 24

Now, let's verify the total valuation each agent receives:

- Agent 0: 92 (item 3) + 81 (item 2) + 71 (item 4) = 244
- Agent 1: 86 (item 5) + 81 (item 3) + 29 (item 0) + 14 (item 1) + 35 (item 6) + 24 (item 7) = 233

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that sum up to as close as possible to their proportional share, minimizing envy.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
