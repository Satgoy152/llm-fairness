Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  92  44  20  66  22   6  89
1  23  12  82  81  93   5  59  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly. We start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items and then try to balance these totals across agents in the allocation.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: \(43 + 92 + 44 + 20 + 66 + 22 + 6 + 89 = 382\)
   - Agent 1: \(23 + 12 + 82 + 81 + 93 + 5 + 59 + 73 = 428\)

2. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's high-value items: Item 1 (92), Item 7 (89)
   - Agent 1's high-value items: Item 4 (93), Item 3 (81), Item 2 (82)

3. **Allocate High-Value Items:**
   - Assign high-value items to each agent to ensure they get items they value the most.

4. **Balance Remaining Items:**
   - Distribute the remaining items to ensure total perceived value is balanced.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0:**
  - Assign items 1, 7, and 0 (total value: \(92 + 89 + 43 = 224\))
  
- **Agent 1:**
  - Assign items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (total value: \(82 + 81 + 93 + 5 + 59 = 320\))

The allocation minimizes envy by ensuring each agent gets items they particularly value and tries to balance the total perceived value.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 three items and Agent 1 five items, balancing the total valuation perceived by each agent as fairly as possible.
