Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  12  69  87  51  74  16  26
1  99  53  53  43  23  50  53  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations of each item and aim for an envy-free division, where no agent prefers the bundle of the other agent over their own. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly.

### Valuations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 45
  - Item 1: 12
  - Item 2: 69
  - Item 3: 87
  - Item 4: 51
  - Item 5: 74
  - Item 6: 16
  - Item 7: 26

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 53
  - Item 2: 53
  - Item 3: 43
  - Item 4: 23
  - Item 5: 50
  - Item 6: 53
  - Item 7: 37

### Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Allocate high-value items for each agent to maximize their satisfaction. 
2. **Ensure Envy-Freeness:** Try to allocate items such that each agent values their own set at least as much as the otherâ€™s.
3. **Balance Item Numbers:** Each agent should receive an equal or nearly equal number of items.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 1** values Item 0 the most out of all items (99), so let's allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values Item 3 the most (87), so let's allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 0** also values Item 5 (74) and Item 2 (69) highly, so let's allocate these to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** values Items 1 (53), 2 (53), and 6 (53) equally, so let's allocate Items 1 and 6 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 0** receives Item 4 due to a high valuation (51), which balances the number of items.
6. Lastly, allocate Item 7 to Agent 1 as it balances the total number of items.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 5, 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 6, 7

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent has a bundle they value without envying the other's bundle.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 6, 7]
}
```
