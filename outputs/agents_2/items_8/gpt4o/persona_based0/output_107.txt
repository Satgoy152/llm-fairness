Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  19  80   3   5  39  59  71
1  51  29  51  54  46  98  43   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items between the two agents, we should aim for envy-freeness, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent. This might not be entirely achievable with integer allocations, but we can try to minimize envy.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- **Agent 0's total valuation:** 13 + 19 + 80 + 3 + 5 + 39 + 59 + 71 = 289
- **Agent 1's total valuation:** 51 + 29 + 51 + 54 + 46 + 98 + 43 + 7 = 379

The goal is to allocate the items such that both agents feel they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

### Initial Allocation Strategy

1. **Highest Value Items:** Allocate the highest value items to agents who value them the most. This tends to reduce envy.

2. **Balancing the Remaining Valuations:** After allocating high-value items, balance the remaining items to equalize the total valuation each agent receives.

### Steps

1. **Allocate item 5 (value 98 for Agent 1):** Assign to Agent 1.
2. **Allocate item 2 (value 80 for Agent 0):** Assign to Agent 0.

3. **Remaining items to allocate:** 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7

4. **Allocate item 6 (value 59 for Agent 0):** Assign to Agent 0. This item is valued highly by Agent 0.

5. **Allocate item 3 (value 54 for Agent 1):** Assign to Agent 1. This item is valued highly by Agent 1.

6. **Remaining items to allocate:** 0, 1, 4, 7

7. **Allocate item 7 (value 71 for Agent 0):** Assign to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it significantly and it balances the allocations.

8. **Allocate item 0 (value 51 for Agent 1):** Assign to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it highly.

9. **Remaining items to allocate:** 1, 4

10. **Allocate item 1 (value 29 for Agent 1):** Assign to Agent 1, balancing their allocation further.

11. **Allocate item 4 (value 5 for Agent 0):** Assign to Agent 0, as it's the last remaining item and balances out the allocation.

### Final Allocations

Based on these assignments, we have:

- **Agent 0:** Items 2, 6, 7, 4
- **Agent 1:** Items 5, 3, 0, 1

Each agent receives four items, and we've attempted to minimize potential envy by maximizing each agent's valuation of their own items.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 7, 4],
    "1": [5, 3, 0, 1]
}
```
