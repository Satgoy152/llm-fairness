Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  93  63  23  59  62  81  86
1  78  25  88  61  95  94  80  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-freeness, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations. We can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or minimizing envy to achieve a balanced allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [94, 93, 63, 23, 59, 62, 81, 86]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [78, 25, 88, 61, 95, 94, 80, 39]

We want to allocate the items to ensure that neither agent envies the other, meaning they would not prefer the other's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

One potential approach to achieving this is to allocate items by giving each agent the items they value more highly, ensuring the total valuation is balanced as much as possible.

Let's consider a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent based on this allocation:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 94 (item 0) + 93 (item 1) + 86 (item 7) = 273
- Agent 1's total valuation: 88 (item 2) + 61 (item 3) + 95 (item 4) + 94 (item 5) + 80 (item 6) = 418

This allocation is not envy-free because agent 0 would envy agent 1's allocation due to the higher total valuation. Therefore, we need to adjust the allocation to balance out the valuations.

One possible balanced allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 7, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 4, 5

Recalculate the total valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 94 (item 0) + 93 (item 1) + 81 (item 6) + 86 (item 7) = 354
- Agent 1's total valuation: 88 (item 2) + 61 (item 3) + 95 (item 4) + 94 (item 5) = 338

This allocation is more balanced, and neither agent envies the other's allocation significantly based on the total valuation. 

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
