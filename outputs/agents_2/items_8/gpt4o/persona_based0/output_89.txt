Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1  2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  40  3  12  40  20  26  54
1   0  82  8  75  77  24   8  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem while considering envy-freeness, we need to allocate the 8 items between the two agents based on their valuations. The goal is to maximize fairness and minimize envy between the agents.

Let's first summarize the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 93 + 40 + 3 + 12 + 40 + 20 + 26 + 54 = 288
- Agent 1: 0 + 82 + 8 + 75 + 77 + 24 + 8 + 92 = 366

Agent 0 values item 0 the highest, while Agent 1 values item 7 the highest. To achieve fairness, we should try to allocate high-value items according to each agent's preferences while balancing the overall value each agent receives.

Let's consider allocating items by alternating the highest valued items for each agent:

1. Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 93), Agent 1 gets item 7 (value 92).
2. Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 77), Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 40).
3. Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 75), Agent 0 gets item 7 (value 54).
4. Agent 0 gets item 5 (value 20), Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 8).
5. Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 26).

Now, let's tally the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 5, 6 (values: 93, 40, 20, 26) = 179
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 4, 7 (values: 8, 75, 77, 92) = 252

This allocation provides a reasonable distribution of items and values, minimizing envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
