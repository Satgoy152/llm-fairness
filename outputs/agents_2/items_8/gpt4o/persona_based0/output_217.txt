Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  22  48  66  83  62  74  86
1   1  52  96  36  84  81  69  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and seek an allocation that minimizes envy. We'll use an approach that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items.

Here are the steps to determine a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Agent 0 values the items with a total sum of: 55 + 22 + 48 + 66 + 83 + 62 + 74 + 86 = 496
   - Agent 1 values the items with a total sum of: 1 + 52 + 96 + 36 + 84 + 81 + 69 + 96 = 515

2. **Goal**: Distribute the 8 items so that the perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible, aiming for each agent to feel they received a fair share according to their own valuations.

3. **Greedy Allocation**:
   - Start by allocating the items to the agent who values them most, ensuring that the distribution remains balanced in terms of total valuation.

4. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign items based on descending order of valuation difference between the agents, prioritizing items that have the largest preference disparity.

5. **Execution**:
   - Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
   - Allocate items in a way that maximizes the total utility for both agents but minimizes the envy.

Let's apply this strategy to the given data:

- Item 0 Difference: 55 - 1 = 54 (preferably to Agent 0)
- Item 1 Difference: 52 - 22 = 30 (preferably to Agent 1)
- Item 2 Difference: 96 - 48 = 48 (preferably to Agent 1)
- Item 3 Difference: 66 - 36 = 30 (preferably to Agent 0)
- Item 4 Difference: 84 - 83 = 1 (either agent)
- Item 5 Difference: 81 - 62 = 19 (preferably to Agent 1)
- Item 6 Difference: 74 - 69 = 5 (preferably to Agent 0)
- Item 7 Difference: 96 - 86 = 10 (preferably to Agent 1)

Based on these differences, a fair allocation could look like:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 5, 7

This allocation ensures that both agents receive four items each, and it balances the total perceived value as closely as possible while taking into account the largest valuation differences.

Let's express this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 7]
}
```
