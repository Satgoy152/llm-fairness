Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  87  95  47  14  40  18  18
1  74  10  76  25  97  59   6  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [74 10 76 25 97 59  6 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1), we must ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible given the valuations. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the allocation of the other agent over their own, based on their valuations. 

Letâ€™s start by analyzing the valuations:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 29      | 74      |
| 1    | 87      | 10      |
| 2    | 95      | 76      |
| 3    | 47      | 25      |
| 4    | 14      | 97      |
| 5    | 40      | 59      |
| 6    | 18      | 6       |
| 7    | 18      | 74      |

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (95), followed by item 1 (87).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (97), followed by item 0 (74).

2. **Allocate high-value items to each agent:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - After assigning the high-value items, we try to distribute the remaining items such that total value is balanced between the two agents.

4. **Balance the remaining allocations:**
   - Agent 0 already has item 2, which is valued at 95.
   - Agent 1 already has item 4, valued at 97.

Now, let's proceed with allocating the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations for each agent:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 87).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 74).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 47).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 74).

Now balance the remaining items (5 and 6):

- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 59), as Agent 1 has more value from item 5 compared to Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 18).

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4, 5, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items, and all items are distributed. The allocations attempt to maximize value for each agent while maintaining fairness.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
