Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  15  53  60  34   3  73  59
1  54  28  31  60  13  83  70  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items between the two agents while aiming for an envy-free allocation, we can employ various strategies. One common approach is the adjusted winner procedure or finding allocations that maximize the minimum utility for each agent.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \( 89 + 15 + 53 + 60 + 34 + 3 + 73 + 59 = 386 \)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \( 54 + 28 + 31 + 60 + 13 + 83 + 70 + 71 = 410 \)

Next, let's attempt to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the value each agent receives, while trying to maintain envy-freeness. We can start by allocating items based on the highest relative value each agent assigns to them.

Here's one potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 and item 6.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 5 and item 7.

Let's allocate these items first:

- Assign item 0 and item 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 and item 7 to Agent 1.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 1 is valued higher by Agent 1, so assign it to Agent 1.
- Item 2 is valued higher by Agent 0, so assign it to Agent 0.
- Item 3 is valued equally by both agents, so assign it to Agent 0 for balance.
- Item 4 is valued higher by Agent 0, but to balance the total number of items, assign it to Agent 1.

The resulting allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives: [0, 2, 3, 6]
- Agent 1 receives: [1, 4, 5, 7]

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations, and the total number of items is distributed evenly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
