Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  84  94  69  39  81  28  20
1  81  67  71  88   5  94  23  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that is envy-free and considers their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation of their allocated items while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

First, let's review the valuation matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 63     | 84     | 94     | 69     | 39     | 81     | 28     | 20     |
| 1     | 81     | 67     | 71     | 88     | 5      | 94     | 23     | 23     |

To allocate the items, let's try to maximize the total value each agent receives. We'll use a method similar to a greedy algorithm to allocate:

1. Sort all items based on the absolute difference in valuations between the two agents.
2. Start by allocating each item to the agent who values it more.
3. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

### Allocation Steps:

- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it higher (94 vs 71) → Assign to Agent 0
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it higher (94 vs 81) → Assign to Agent 1
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it higher (88 vs 69) → Assign to Agent 1
- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it higher (81 vs 63) → Assign to Agent 1
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it higher (84 vs 67) → Assign to Agent 0
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it higher (28 vs 23) → Assign to Agent 0
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it higher (39 vs 5) → Assign to Agent 0
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it higher (20 vs 23) → Assign to Agent 1

Now we have:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 1, 6, 4
- Agent 1: Items 5, 3, 0, 7

This allocation gives us a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations, maximizing the sum of each agent's valuations for the items they receive.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 6, 4],
    "1": [5, 3, 0, 7]
}
```
