Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  23  29  28  18  24  60  38
1  25  94  92  82  40  21  30  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free if possible. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation given to the other agent.

Here's how we can approach the allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate items such that each agent perceives they have at least half of the total value they assign to all items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 31 + 23 + 29 + 28 + 18 + 24 + 60 + 38 = 251
- Agent 1's total valuation: 25 + 94 + 92 + 82 + 40 + 21 + 30 + 94 = 478

Now, let's try to allocate items to ensure a fair division. One simple approach is to prioritize items where the difference in valuation between the two agents is greatest, as this can help achieve envy-freeness.

By prioritizing the allocation based on the differences in valuations and ensuring each agent feels they have received a fair share, we can approach an envy-free allocation:

1. Start by allocating items that have significantly higher valuations by one agent compared to the other to the agent who values them more.
2. Balance the remaining items to ensure each agent perceives their allocation as valuable.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Give item 1 to Agent 1 because they value it significantly higher (94 vs. 23).
- Give item 2 to Agent 1 because they value it significantly higher (92 vs. 29).
- Give item 3 to Agent 1 because they value it significantly higher (82 vs. 28).
- Give item 7 to Agent 1 because they value it significantly higher (94 vs. 38).
- Give item 6 to Agent 0 because they value it significantly higher (60 vs. 30).
- Distribute the remaining items to balance the perceived values.

Using this strategy, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 4, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 7]

Let's verify this allocation:

- Agent 0 values their allocation at 31 + 18 + 24 + 60 = 133.
- Agent 1 values their allocation at 94 + 92 + 82 + 94 = 362.

Both agents should feel they have received a fair share based on their valuations. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7]
}
```
