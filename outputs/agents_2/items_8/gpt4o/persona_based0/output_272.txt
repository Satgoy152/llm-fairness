Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  48  78  61  30  26  13  58
1  76  45  97  68  85   6   5  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [76 45 97 68 85  6  5 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent.

Here are the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(9 + 48 + 78 + 61 + 30 + 26 + 13 + 58 = 323\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(76 + 45 + 97 + 68 + 85 + 6 + 5 + 54 = 436\)

We will attempt to allocate items such that each agent's share of their own perceived value is maximized. One useful approach is the "Divide and Choose" method, but since we have complete information, we can optimize the allocation directly.

Let's allocate items to maximize fairness:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item for the two agents.
2. Allocate items to the agent who values it more, while ensuring that the total number of items for each agent remains balanced (i.e., 4 items each).

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 3, 6, 7
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: \(48 + 61 + 13 + 58 = 180\)
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 2, 4, 5
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: \(76 + 97 + 85 + 6 = 264\)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 4 items, and each agent's total perceived value is maximized given their own valuation function.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
