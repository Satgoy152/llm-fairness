Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  36  60  91  76  10   0  61
1  40  32  77  13  12  31  99  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An allocation is envy-free if each agent feels they received at least as much value as the other agent from their own perspective.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 52 + 36 + 60 + 91 + 76 + 10 + 0 + 61 = 386
- Agent 1's total valuation: 40 + 32 + 77 + 13 + 12 + 31 + 99 + 82 = 386

Interestingly, both agents value the collection of items equally, which simplifies our task. We will try to allocate items such that both agents feel they have received approximately half of the total value from their perspective.

To ensure the allocation is fair, let's consider the following strategy:

1. Sort items by their value for each agent and try to balance the total value received by each agent.
2. Attempt to avoid scenarios where one agent has a significantly higher value than the other.

Here's one possible allocation:

**Allocation:**

- Agent 0:
  - Items: 3, 4, 0, 1
  - Total value: 91 + 76 + 52 + 36 = 255

- Agent 1:
  - Items: 2, 5, 6, 7
  - Total value: 77 + 31 + 99 + 82 = 289

Both agents have received items they value highly, and the distribution is as balanced as possible with the given valuations.

**Final Allocation in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that both agents are satisfied with their received value relative to the total value they assign to the items.
