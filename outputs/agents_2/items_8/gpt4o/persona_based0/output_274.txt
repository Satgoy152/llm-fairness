Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  53  24  19  68  76  10  49
1  83  92   0  78  29  73  57  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 92  0 78 29 73 57 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent receives a bundle of items such that they do not prefer the bundle received by the other agent more than their own.

Given the valuations:

Agent 0: [37, 53, 24, 19, 68, 76, 10, 49]  
Agent 1: [83, 92, 0, 78, 29, 73, 57, 26]

One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items based on the highest valuations, while ensuring that neither agent feels envious of the other.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Sort items by each agent's valuation** and allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while keeping track of the total number of items each agent receives to ensure each gets an integer number of items.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it more (83 vs 37), allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it more (92 vs 53), allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it more (24 vs 0), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it more (78 vs 19), allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it more (68 vs 29), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it more (76 vs 73), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it more (57 vs 10), allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it more (49 vs 26), allocate to Agent 0.

Check allocation balance:
- Agent 0 has 4 items: [2, 4, 5, 7]
- Agent 1 has 4 items: [0, 1, 3, 6]

This allocation ensures that both agents have an integer number of items (4 each), and attempts to minimize envy by allocating items based on their highest valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 6]
}
```
