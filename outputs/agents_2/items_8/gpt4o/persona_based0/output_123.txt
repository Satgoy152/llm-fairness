Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  26  73   6  78  77  44  78
1  10  79  46  29  65  58  71   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 79 46 29 65 58 71  8]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to balance the total value each agent receives. Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0:
Items:  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
Values: 86  26  73   6  78  77  44  78

Agent 1:
Items:  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
Values: 10  79  46  29  65  58  71   8
```

First, calculate the total value of all items for each agent:
- Agent 0: 86 + 26 + 73 + 6 + 78 + 77 + 44 + 78 = 468
- Agent 1: 10 + 79 + 46 + 29 + 65 + 58 + 71 + 8 = 366

The goal is to allocate items such that the perceived total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **High Value Difference**: Items with a high valuation difference between agents should go to the agent with higher valuation.  
2. **Balancing Total Value**: Aim for an equal or close-perceived total value for each agent.

Now, let's make the allocations:

- **Agent 0** highly values items 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7.
- **Agent 1** highly values items 1, 6, and 3.

Let's allocate:

1. **Agent 0** should get items: 0, 2, 4, 5
   - Value: 86 + 73 + 78 + 77 = 314

2. **Agent 1** should get items: 1, 3, 6, 7
   - Value: 79 + 29 + 71 + 8 = 187

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
