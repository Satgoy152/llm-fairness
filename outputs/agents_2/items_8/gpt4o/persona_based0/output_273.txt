Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  80  19  25  53   7  62  49
1   1  62  91  64  45  27  45  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to aim for an allocation where each agent values their bundle at least as much as the other agent's bundle, based on their own valuation. This is often challenging, but we can strive to minimize envy as much as possible.

Let's examine the total valuation for each agent over all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 46 + 80 + 19 + 25 + 53 + 7 + 62 + 49 = 341
- Agent 1's total valuation: 1 + 62 + 91 + 64 + 45 + 27 + 45 + 35 = 370

Given these valuations, we aim to allocate items to balance these totals as closely as possible, while keeping the number of items allocated to each agent equal.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Identify high-value items:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 highly (80), while agent 1 values item 2 highly (91).
   
2. **Allocate items strategically:**
   - Aim to give agent 0 a combination of items that balances their perceived value with what agent 1 receives.
   - Similarly, balance agent 1's perceived value with what agent 0 receives.

### Proposed Allocation:
- Allocate items based on maximizing each agent's perceived total value while keeping envy minimized.

- **Agent 0:** Assign items [0, 1, 4, 7]
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 46 (item 0) + 80 (item 1) + 53 (item 4) + 49 (item 7) = 228

- **Agent 1:** Assign items [2, 3, 5, 6]
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 91 (item 2) + 64 (item 3) + 27 (item 5) + 45 (item 6) = 227

Both agents receive four items each, and the allocation attempts to balance their perceived total valuations as closely as possible.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy between the agents by ensuring each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, given the constraints of the problem.
