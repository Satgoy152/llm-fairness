Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  76  52  55  73  16  21  22
1  46  15  75  56  74  73  59  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim for an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should feel that they received a fair share according to their own valuations. We will attempt to balance the perceived value of the allocations between the two agents.

First, let's summarize each agent's total valuation of all items:

- **Agent 0**: 7 + 76 + 52 + 55 + 73 + 16 + 21 + 22 = 322
- **Agent 1**: 46 + 15 + 75 + 56 + 74 + 73 + 59 + 79 = 477

Next, we will try to allocate the items such that the total value each agent perceives is as balanced as possible. We can start by assigning items that are highly valued by each agent.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 (76) and item 4 (73).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 7 (79) and item 5 (73).

### Tentative Allocations:
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

#### Remaining Items:
Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 6.

#### Further Allocation:
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (75 vs 52).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it slightly more (56 vs 55).
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (46 vs 7).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (59 vs 21).

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 4]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]

### Verification:
Let's calculate the total perceived value for each agent based on this allocation:

- **Agent 0's perceived value**: 76 (item 1) + 73 (item 4) = 149
- **Agent 1's perceived value**: 46 (item 0) + 75 (item 2) + 56 (item 3) + 73 (item 5) + 59 (item 6) + 79 (item 7) = 388

This allocation is heavily skewed towards Agent 1, so let's attempt a more balanced allocation:

### Revised Allocation:
Let's provide a more balanced allocation by redistributing some items:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 4, 6, 3]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 2, 5, 7]

### Verification of Revised Allocation:
- **Agent 0's perceived value**: 76 (item 1) + 73 (item 4) + 21 (item 6) + 55 (item 3) = 225
- **Agent 1's perceived value**: 46 (item 0) + 75 (item 2) + 73 (item 5) + 79 (item 7) = 273

This allocation is more balanced. 

### Final JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 7]
}
```
