Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89   8  42  64  61  44  77  20
1  55  62  42  86  14  72  19  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to minimize envy between them. The goal is to allocate items such that each agent values their own bundle at least as much as they value the bundle of the other agent.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [89, 8, 42, 64, 61, 44, 77, 20]  
- Agent 1's valuations: [55, 62, 42, 86, 14, 72, 19, 74]

Let's follow a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 (89) very highly, so it makes sense for Agent 0 to get this.
   - Agent 1 values items 3 (86) and 5 (72) highly, so these should go to Agent 1.

2. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - After assigning the high-value items, we allocate the remaining items considering the next highest valuations for each agent while trying to balance the total value received by each.

3. **Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 4, and 6
     - Item 0: 89
     - Item 4: 61
     - Item 6: 77
     - Total value for Agent 0: 89 + 61 + 77 = 227
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
     - Item 1: 62
     - Item 2: 42
     - Item 3: 86
     - Item 5: 72
     - Item 7: 74
     - Total value for Agent 1: 62 + 42 + 86 + 72 + 74 = 336

This allocation aims to reduce envy since each agent gets items they value highly. Let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and considers the valuations to minimize envy.
