Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  35  48  94  28  21  78  62
1   5  51   2  39   7  64  29  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to ensure that each agent's allocation maximizes their overall value, while also aiming for envy-freeness (where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own).

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(48 + 35 + 48 + 94 + 28 + 21 + 78 + 62 = 414\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(5 + 51 + 2 + 39 + 7 + 64 + 29 + 68 = 265\)

Next, let's evaluate which items are more valuable to each agent and attempt to allocate them in a way that balances the total valuations each receives:

1. **Agent 0's Highest Valuations:**
   - Item 3: 94
   - Item 6: 78
   - Item 0: 48
   - Item 2: 48
   - Item 7: 62

2. **Agent 1's Highest Valuations:**
   - Item 5: 64
   - Item 7: 68
   - Item 1: 51
   - Item 3: 39

Now, let's allocate these items to ensure both agents receive a fair share:

- Assign Agent 0 items 3, 6, 0, and 2. This gives them a total valuation of \(94 + 78 + 48 + 48 = 268\).
- Assign Agent 1 items 5, 7, 1, and 4. This gives them a total valuation of \(64 + 68 + 51 + 7 = 190\).

Checking the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items {0, 2, 3, 6} with a total valuation of 268.
- Agent 1: Items {1, 4, 5, 7} with a total valuation of 190.

This allocation ensures both agents receive items they highly value, while keeping the total valuations relatively balanced.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims for fairness by giving each agent a set of items that maximizes their total value according to their preferences, while maintaining envy-freeness to the best extent possible with integer allocations.
