Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  58  12  25  14  82  42  69
1   2  87  31   0  33  23  31  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 2 87 31  0 33 23 31 77]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we need to allocate items such that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation. Given the valuations of the items by the agents, we can attempt to balance the allocations based on maximizing each agent's perceived value.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0 valuations: 19, 58, 12, 25, 14, 82, 42, 69
Agent 1 valuations:  2, 87, 31,  0, 33, 23, 31, 77
```

To find a fair allocation, we will try to assign items in a way that maximizes the total perceived value for each agent while keeping the allocations as balanced as possible. We'll start by examining the items with the highest value for each agent and try to distribute them fairly.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items: Item 5 (82), Item 7 (69), Item 1 (58)
   - We assign Item 5 and 7 to Agent 0 as they have high value for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items: Item 1 (87), Item 7 (77), Item 2 (31)
   - Assign Item 1 and 3 to Agent 1 since Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 1, and Item 3 is not valued by Agent 0.

3. **Balanced Allocation:**
   - Now, assign remaining items to balance the perceived value.
   - Assign Item 0 (19), Item 4 (14), and Item 6 (42) to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 2 (31) to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

Each agent should have an allocation where they do not envy the other's allocation. Let's ensure that both agents have items that maximize their perceived value without making them envious of each other's allocation.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

- **Agent 0 receives items:** 0, 5, 6, 7
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 19 + 82 + 42 + 69 = 212

- **Agent 1 receives items:** 1, 2, 3, 4
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 87 + 31 + 0 + 33 = 151

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived values, ensuring each agent feels satisfied with their allocation based on their own valuation of the items.
