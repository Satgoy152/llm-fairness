Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  49  18  32  64  68   8  54
1  23  97  92  14  34  32  58  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for their assigned items. We'll calculate the total valuation for several possible allocations and choose the one that is closest to equal or provides a fair distribution based on the agents' preferences.

Let's consider the following steps:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Compute the sum of valuations for each possible item allocation to determine which allocations maximize individual satisfaction.

2. **Evaluate Multiple Allocation Scenarios**: Try different allocations to find one that minimizes envy and maximizes fairness.

3. **Select the Best Allocation**: Choose the allocation where the difference in total valuations between the agents is minimized, ensuring envy-freeness.

Let's evaluate some allocations:

- **Allocation 1**:
  - Agent 0: [0, 4, 5, 7]
    - Total Valuation: 61 + 64 + 68 + 54 = 247
  - Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 6]
    - Total Valuation: 97 + 92 + 14 + 58 = 261

- **Allocation 2**:
  - Agent 0: [0, 1, 5, 7]
    - Total Valuation: 61 + 49 + 68 + 54 = 232
  - Agent 1: [2, 3, 4, 6]
    - Total Valuation: 92 + 14 + 34 + 58 = 198

- **Allocation 3**:
  - Agent 0: [0, 2, 4, 6]
    - Total Valuation: 61 + 18 + 64 + 8 = 151
  - Agent 1: [1, 3, 5, 7]
    - Total Valuation: 97 + 14 + 32 + 22 = 165

After evaluating the allocations, Allocation 1 provides the closest total valuation and minimizes envy, as both agents have a relatively balanced valuation for their allocations (247 vs. 261).

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
