Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  21  52  86  95  34  57  55
1  60  69  15  27  87  95  75  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation where neither agent envies the other's allocation. This concept is known as envy-freeness. One way to achieve this is by maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while considering the fairness of the allocation.

Let's examine the total valuations each agent assigns to the items:

Agent 0's valuations: [79, 21, 52, 86, 95, 34, 57, 55]  
Agent 1's valuations: [60, 69, 15, 27, 87, 95, 75, 81]

To achieve a fair allocation, let's consider the following process:

1. Start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most, while keeping an eye on the balance of the total valuation between the two agents.

2. Check for potential envy and adjust allocations to minimize or eliminate envy.

3. Ensure all items are allocated, and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 at 60. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 at 69. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 52, Agent 1 at 15. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 at 27. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 at 87. Allocate to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 at 95. Allocate to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 at 75. Allocate to Agent 1.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 at 81. Allocate to Agent 1.

Let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 3, 4
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 79 + 52 + 86 + 95 = 312

- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 5, 6, 7
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 69 + 95 + 75 + 81 = 320

This allocation provides a balanced distribution of total valuations, minimizing potential envy between the agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
