Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  79  44  50  56   4  30  36
1  11  30  22  39  64  91  10  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim for an allocation that is envy-free and tries to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation for all items: \(43 + 79 + 44 + 50 + 56 + 4 + 30 + 36 = 342\)
   - Agent 1's total valuation for all items: \(11 + 30 + 22 + 39 + 64 + 91 + 10 + 68 = 335\)

2. **Determine Each Agent's Valuation for Each Item:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (79), followed by item 4 (56).
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most (91), followed by item 7 (68).

3. **Allocate Items to Minimize Envy:**
   - Assign items that each agent highly values to that agent, ensuring both have an equal opportunity to have a high total valuation.

4. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Agent 0:** Aim to allocate items that maximize Agent 0's valuation while balancing the total number of items.
   - **Agent 1:** Aim to allocate items that maximize Agent 1's valuation while balancing the total number of items.

5. **Implement the Allocation:**
   - Assign items to agents based on their individual valuations, keeping in mind the total number of items should be 8, and each agent should get an integer number of items.

After analyzing the above criteria, here's a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Assign items [0, 1, 4, 6] to Agent 0. This gives Agent 0 a total valuation of \(43 + 79 + 56 + 30 = 208\).
- **Agent 1:** Assign items [2, 3, 5, 7] to Agent 1. This gives Agent 1 a total valuation of \(22 + 39 + 91 + 68 = 220\).

The allocation is close in terms of total valuation for each agent and each agent receives 4 items.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
