Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  91  36  67  19  72  12  68
1  46  63  54  44  74  21  45  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item and try to balance the total value allocated to each agent. We want to minimize the difference in total value perceived by each agent for the items they receive.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 42 + 91 + 36 + 67 + 19 + 72 + 12 + 68 = 407
- Agent 1's total valuation: 46 + 63 + 54 + 44 + 74 + 21 + 45 + 89 = 436

To achieve a fair division, we'll attempt to distribute the items such that the total valuation each agent receives is as balanced as possible, considering their individual valuations.

Let's try the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign the items that have the largest valuation difference between the agents to the agent who values them more, to quickly balance out the perceived value.

2. Adjust by reallocating items if necessary to ensure both agents receive an integer number of items.

After considering the above, an allocation that balances the total value perceived by each agent could be:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 1, 3, 6]
- Agent 1 receives items: [2, 4, 5, 7]

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent receives:

- Agent 0's received valuation: 42 (item 0) + 91 (item 1) + 67 (item 3) + 12 (item 6) = 212
- Agent 1's received valuation: 54 (item 2) + 74 (item 4) + 21 (item 5) + 89 (item 7) = 238

This allocation gives a reasonably fair distribution with the perceived value difference minimized. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
