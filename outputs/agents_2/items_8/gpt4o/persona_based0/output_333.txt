Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  91  87  57  83  70  75  90
1  82  34  19  91   4  58  56  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming to minimize envy, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. We will try to distribute the items in such a way that the perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [7, 91, 87, 57, 83, 70, 75, 90]
- Agent 1's valuations: [82, 34, 19, 91, 4, 58, 56, 37]

First, we'll calculate the total valuation each agent would have if they received all the items:

- Agent 0 total value: 7 + 91 + 87 + 57 + 83 + 70 + 75 + 90 = 560
- Agent 1 total value: 82 + 34 + 19 + 91 + 4 + 58 + 56 + 37 = 381

To allocate fairly, we want each agent to receive approximately half of the total value of their maximum possible allocation.

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. Allocate items to Agent 0 that they value highly, while keeping an eye on maintaining balance:
   - Agent 0 values items 1, 2, 4, and 7 highly.

2. Allocate items to Agent 1 that they value highly:
   - Agent 1 values items 0, 3, 5, and 6 highly.

Let's finalize this allocation while ensuring that each agent gets exactly 4 items, as there are 8 items in total.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 2, 4, 7]
  - Their total valuation: 91 + 87 + 83 + 90 = 351

- Agent 1: [0, 3, 5, 6]
  - Their total valuation: 82 + 91 + 58 + 56 = 287

The allocations are balanced in terms of the value each agent perceives.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
