Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  51  50   7  28  53  35  65
1  90  65  68  46  63  47  57  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a process that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation from the items they receive. We will ensure that each agent gets at least a somewhat equitable share based on their valuations.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 66 + 51 + 50 + 7 + 28 + 53 + 35 + 65 = 355
- Agent 1: 90 + 65 + 68 + 46 + 63 + 47 + 57 + 23 = 459

Next, we'll aim to allocate items such that the total valuation each agent receives from their assigned items is as balanced as possible relative to their total possible valuation.

A common approach is using a greedy algorithm:

1. Sort the items by the difference in valuation between the two agents, i.e., |value_agent_0 - value_agent_1|.
2. Allocate the item to the agent who values it more.
3. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Let's apply this method:

1. Calculate the valuation difference for each item:
   - Item 0: |66 - 90| = 24
   - Item 1: |51 - 65| = 14
   - Item 2: |50 - 68| = 18
   - Item 3: |7 - 46| = 39
   - Item 4: |28 - 63| = 35
   - Item 5: |53 - 47| = 6
   - Item 6: |35 - 57| = 22
   - Item 7: |65 - 23| = 42

2. Sort items by the valuation difference:
   - Item 7: 42
   - Item 3: 39
   - Item 4: 35
   - Item 0: 24
   - Item 6: 22
   - Item 2: 18
   - Item 1: 14
   - Item 5: 6

3. Allocate items:
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (65 vs 23)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (7 vs 46)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (28 vs 63)
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (66 vs 90)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (35 vs 57)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (50 vs 68)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (51 vs 65)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (53 vs 47)

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [7, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1]

Total valuation for Agent 0: 65 + 53 = 118
Total valuation for Agent 1: 46 + 63 + 90 + 57 + 68 + 65 = 389

While the distribution is not perfectly equal in terms of numerical value, it respects the higher individual valuations each agent places on the items. Therefore, this allocation aims to reflect envy-freeness by giving agents items they value more relative to the other agent.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1]
}
```
