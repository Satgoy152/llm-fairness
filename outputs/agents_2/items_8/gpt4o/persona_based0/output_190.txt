Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  19  27  55  92  63  31   0
1  18   8  14  34  64  89  81  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the allocation of the other agent. This is a challenging task, especially when agents have significantly different valuations for items.

Let's start by examining the valuations table and assigning items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while trying to maintain envy-freeness:

```
Valuations Table:

Agent 0:
Item 0: 90
Item 1: 19
Item 2: 27
Item 3: 55
Item 4: 92
Item 5: 63
Item 6: 31
Item 7: 0

Agent 1:
Item 0: 18
Item 1: 8
Item 2: 14
Item 3: 34
Item 4: 64
Item 5: 89
Item 6: 81
Item 7: 49
```

A reasonable approach is to start by allocating items based on each agent's highest valuations to ensure that each agent receives items they highly value:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 4 (92), 0 (90), and 5 (63).
2. Agent 1 highly values items 5 (89), 6 (81), and 7 (49).

Now, let's assign the items:

- Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 0, as they are the highest-valued items for Agent 0.
- Assign items 5 and 6 to Agent 1, as they are the highest-valued items for Agent 1.

Next, we need to allocate the remaining items 1, 2, 3, and 7:

- Agent 0 values item 3 (55) more than Agent 1 does (34), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 7 (49) more than Agent 0 does (0), so allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
  
Finally, we have items 1 and 2 to allocate:

- Agent 0 values item 2 (27) more than Agent 1 (14), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 (8) slightly more than Agent 0 (19), but due to balance, allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 five items but maximizes their total valuation, while Agent 1 receives three items that are highly valued. This division aims to minimize envy between the two agents given the constraints.
