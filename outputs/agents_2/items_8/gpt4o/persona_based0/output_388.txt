Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  87  41  59  78  63  26   7
1  35  85  67  76  28  13  99  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 85 67 76 28 13 99 65]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents so that the allocation is envy-free, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and aim to maximize the perceived fairness of the allocation. Envy-freeness implies that each agent perceives their allocated items to be at least as valuable as the items allocated to the other agent.

Here are the valuations for reference:

- Agent 0: [42, 87, 41, 59, 78, 63, 26, 7]
- Agent 1: [35, 85, 67, 76, 28, 13, 99, 65]

We will perform the allocation aiming for the max-min fairness, considering the highest preference for each agent while ensuring that the other agent does not envy the allocation.

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 because it has the highest value for them (87).
2. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 because it has the highest value for them (99).
3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 because it is their next highest value (78) and is not highly valued by Agent 1.
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 because it is their next highest value (76).
5. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 because it is their next highest value (63) and is not highly valued by Agent 1.
6. Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 because it is their next highest value (65).
7. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 because it is their next highest value (42) and is of low value to Agent 1.
8. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because it is their next highest value (67).

The final allocation based on these choices is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items perceived as valuable, and neither agent envies the allocation of the other agent.
