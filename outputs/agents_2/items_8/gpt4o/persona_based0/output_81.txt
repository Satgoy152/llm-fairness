Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  47  49  41  80  64  27  58
1  15  56  56  40  20  75  36  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [15 56 56 40 20 75 36 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and aim to distribute the total perceived value as equally as possible.

Let's sum the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 70 + 47 + 49 + 41 + 80 + 64 + 27 + 58 = 436
- Agent 1's total valuation: 15 + 56 + 56 + 40 + 20 + 75 + 36 + 68 = 366

Now, we aim to allocate the items such that the total value each agent perceives from their allocated items is as close as possible while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

To achieve this, we can start by assigning items with significant differences in valuation to the agent who values them more and then adjust as needed to balance the total perceived value.

1. Assign items to Agent 0 based on higher valuation:
   - Item 0: 70 > 15
   - Item 4: 80 > 20

2. Assign items to Agent 1 based on higher valuation:
   - Item 5: 75 > 64
   - Item 7: 68 > 58

At this stage, we have:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 7]

Now, distribute the remaining items to balance the perceived total values:

3. Allocate remaining items:
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (56 vs 47), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (56 vs 49), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (41 vs 40), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 has a higher relative value (27 vs 36), assign to Agent 1.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 4] with total valuation 70 + 41 + 80 = 191
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 5, 6, 7] with total valuation 56 + 56 + 75 + 36 + 68 = 291

Although the valuations are not perfectly equal, this allocation respects the constraints and attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
