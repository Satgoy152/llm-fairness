Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  84  39  72  21  72  79  81
1  88  29  94  93  21  27  79  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while trying to maintain envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items. Envy-freeness means each agent should value their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent.

Let's evaluate the situation:

**Agent 0's valuations:**
- Item 0: 33
- Item 1: 84
- Item 2: 39
- Item 3: 72
- Item 4: 21
- Item 5: 72
- Item 6: 79
- Item 7: 81

**Agent 1's valuations:**
- Item 0: 88
- Item 1: 29
- Item 2: 94
- Item 3: 93
- Item 4: 21
- Item 5: 27
- Item 6: 79
- Item 7: 10

Let's allocate the items in a way that tries to balance the total valuation received by each agent. We'll start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent, considering their preferences.

1. **Allocate high value items to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 1 (84) and 7 (81).
   - Agent 1 highly values items 2 (94) and 3 (93).

2. **Allocate remaining items considering balance:**
   - Agent 0 can also receive item 6 (79).
   - Agent 1 can also receive item 0 (88).

3. **Distribute remaining lower value items:**
   - Agent 0 can take items 5 (72).
   - Agent 1 can take items 4 (21).

4. **Final item allocation based on remaining preferences:**
   - Agent 0 can take item 3 (72).
   - Agent 1 can take item 2 (94).

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives exactly 4 items and that their allocations are close to envy-free based on their valuations. We can adjust the allocation slightly for balance.

Here's the final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 5, and 6.
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 4, and 7.

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 7]
}
```
