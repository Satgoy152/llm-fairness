Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  24  88   9  97  50  16  89
1  83  42  59  54  51  29  62  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, ideally reaching an envy-free state if possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Let's calculate the total value for each agent if they were to receive all the items:

- Agent 0 total value: 51 + 24 + 88 + 9 + 97 + 50 + 16 + 89 = 424
- Agent 1 total value: 83 + 42 + 59 + 54 + 51 + 29 + 62 + 79 = 459

The goal is to split the items such that the perceived value for each agent is as equal as possible. One straightforward approach is to try splitting the items in a way that the total value perceived by each agent is balanced.

A possible allocation strategy could involve checking combinations that balance the total perceived values. After examining the valuations, a reasonable allocation is:

- Allocate items to Agent 0: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Allocate items to Agent 1: 1, 3, 5, 7

Let's calculate the perceived values for this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, 4, 6:
  - Total value for Agent 0 = 51 (item 0) + 88 (item 2) + 97 (item 4) + 16 (item 6) = 252

- Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, 5, 7:
  - Total value for Agent 1 = 42 (item 1) + 54 (item 3) + 29 (item 5) + 79 (item 7) = 204

Despite the total perceived values not being perfectly balanced, this allocation is close and respects the integer allocation constraint. Each agent gets four items, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
