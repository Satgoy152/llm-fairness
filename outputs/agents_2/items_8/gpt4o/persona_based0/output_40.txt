Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79   7   7  94  43   3  66  78
1  93  56  32  54  19  48  79  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We will use a method that tries to balance the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations, and attempt to make the division as envy-free as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations:**
   - Items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
   - Values: [79, 7, 7, 94, 43, 3, 66, 78]

2. **Agent 1 Valuations:**
   - Items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
   - Values: [93, 56, 32, 54, 19, 48, 79, 46]

**Total Valuations:**
- Agent 0 Total Valuation: 377
- Agent 1 Total Valuation: 427

To simplify the task, let's allocate the items starting with the highest value each agent assigns to an item, then distribute to balance out the perceived total value:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest value item: 3 (value 94)
  - Second highest: 0 (value 79)
  - Third highest: 7 (value 78)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest value item: 0 (value 93)
  - Second highest: 6 (value 79)
  - Third highest: 1 (value 56)

Now, let's proceed to allocate:

1. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0** (value 94 for Agent 0, 54 for Agent 1)
2. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1** (value 93 for Agent 1, 79 for Agent 0)
3. **Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1** (value 79 for Agent 1, 66 for Agent 0)
4. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1** (value 56 for Agent 1, 7 for Agent 0)
5. **Allocate Item 7 to Agent 0** (value 78 for Agent 0, 46 for Agent 1)
6. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0** (value 43 for Agent 0, 19 for Agent 1)
7. **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1** (value 48 for Agent 1, 3 for Agent 0)
8. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0** (value 7 for Agent 0, 32 for Agent 1)

**Final Allocation:**

- **Agent 0**: Items [3, 7, 4, 2]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 94 + 78 + 43 + 7 = 222

- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 6, 1, 5]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 93 + 79 + 56 + 48 = 276

By this allocation, both agents receive a significant portion of items based on their preference, and the perceived value is reasonably balanced given their valuations.

**Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 4, 2],
    "1": [0, 6, 1, 5]
}
```
