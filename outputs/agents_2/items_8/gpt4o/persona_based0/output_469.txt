Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  14  69   6  95  72  39  55
1  36   9  29  65  91  97   1  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items such that their perceived value of the allocation is maximized while maintaining a sense of fairness. One approach to achieve this is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of items received by the other agent over their own.

Let's consider the valuations given:

- Agent 0:  
  - Items: [99, 14, 69, 6, 95, 72, 39, 55]

- Agent 1:
  - Items: [36, 9, 29, 65, 91, 97, 1, 29]

To ensure a fair division, we need to consider the total value each agent assigns to a potential allocation, ensuring that both agents feel they are receiving an equitable share.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Assign High-Value Items:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 and item 4 (99 and 95). Assign these to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 5 (97) and item 3 (65). Assign these to Agent 1.

2. **Balance Remaining Items:**
   - After assigning the highest valued items, we need to balance the allocation based on the remaining items.
   - For Agent 0: Items 2, 5, and 6 have significant values left. We already assigned item 5 to Agent 1, so consider assigning item 2 (69) and item 6 (39) to Agent 0.
   - For Agent 1: Items 4 and 7 have significant values left. We already assigned item 4 to Agent 0, so consider assigning item 7 (29) to Agent 1.

3. **Final Allocation:**
   - Ensure all items are allocated without exceeding 8 items total.

The allocations aim to balance the total perceived value each agent receives:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 4, 6]
  - Values: [99, 69, 95, 39] = 302

- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 5, 7]
  - Values: [9, 65, 97, 29] = 200

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives their fair share based on their valuations, and no agent envies the other's allocation.
