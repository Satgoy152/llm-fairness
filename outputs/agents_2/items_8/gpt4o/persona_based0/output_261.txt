Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  94  21  26  56  85  22  82
1   8  68  60  68  82  84  75  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent feels that they have received at least as much value as the other agent does from their own allocation.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(93 + 94 + 21 + 26 + 56 + 85 + 22 + 82 = 479\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(8 + 68 + 60 + 68 + 82 + 84 + 75 + 34 = 479\)

Both agents have the same total valuation for all the items combined, which makes it easier to find a fair division.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify Items with Highest Individual Valuation for Each Agent:** Agents should receive items they value the most to increase their satisfaction.

2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets 4 Items:** Since there are 8 items and 2 agents, each should receive 4 items.

### Steps for Allocation

- **Agent 0's Valuation Priority:** Item 1 (94), Item 0 (93), Item 5 (85), Item 7 (82)
- **Agent 1's Valuation Priority:** Item 5 (84), Item 4 (82), Item 1 (68), Item 3 (68)

**Proposed Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 1, 5, 7
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: \(93 + 94 + 85 + 82 = 354\)

- **Agent 1:** Items 2, 3, 4, 6
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: \(60 + 68 + 82 + 75 = 285\)

### Checking Envy-Freeness

- **Agent 0's view of Agent 1's allocation:** \(21 + 26 + 56 + 22 = 125\) (Agent 0 values Agent 1's items at 125, which is less than their own valuation of 354)
- **Agent 1's view of Agent 0's allocation:** \(8 + 68 + 84 + 34 = 194\) (Agent 1 values Agent 0's items at 194, which is less than their own valuation of 285)

Both agents value their own allocation higher than the other's, thus the allocation is envy-free.

Here is the allocation in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
