Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  97  73  75  84  12  91  18
1  70  69  34  62  55  85   2  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can employ the concept of envy-freeness where each agent should not envy the allocation received by the other, based on their valuations.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 
  36 + 97 + 73 + 75 + 84 + 12 + 91 + 18 = 486

- Agent 1's total valuation:
  70 + 69 + 34 + 62 + 55 + 85 + 2 + 43 = 420

Given that there are 8 items, a simple goal is to try to allocate items such that each agent receives roughly half of the total valuation according to their own preferences.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 1 (value 97)
   - Item 4 (value 84)
   - Item 6 (value 91)
   - Item 2 (value 73)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0 (value 70)
   - Item 3 (value 62)
   - Item 5 (value 85)
   - Item 7 (value 43)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 4 items. Now let's check the total value each agent assigns to their allocated items:

- **Agent 0's allocation**: 
  - Total value = 97 + 84 + 91 + 73 = 345

- **Agent 1's allocation**: 
  - Total value = 70 + 62 + 85 + 43 = 260

Both agents receive a fair share of the total value according to their valuations, respecting the concept of envy-freeness as much as possible given the discrete nature of the problem.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
