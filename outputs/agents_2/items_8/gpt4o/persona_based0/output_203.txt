Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75   1  75  45  42  82  26  90
1  60  70  49  42  92  49   9  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [60 70 49 42 92 49  9 38]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division and minimize envy among agents based on their valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 75 + 1 + 75 + 45 + 42 + 82 + 26 + 90 = 436
- Agent 1's total valuation: 60 + 70 + 49 + 42 + 92 + 49 + 9 + 38 = 409

Next, we will attempt to allocate items by maximizing the perceived value for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items:**
   - Item 7: 90
   - Item 5: 82
   - Item 0: 75
   - Item 2: 75

2. **Agent 1's highest valued items:**
   - Item 4: 92
   - Item 1: 70
   - Item 2: 49
   - Item 5: 49

### Allocation Strategy:

- Start by allocating items with the highest valuation for each agent but avoid conflicts by considering the next best options.

#### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Allocate items 7, 5, 0, 2
  - Values: 90, 82, 75, 75

- **Agent 1:**
  - Allocate items 4, 1, 3, 6
  - Values: 92, 70, 42, 9

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items based on their highest valuations, while each agent receives four items, satisfying the integer allocation requirement.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5, 0, 2],
    "1": [4, 1, 3, 6]
}
```
