Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  35  65  11  42  93  30  50
1  12  30  89  33  57  32  68  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuation each agent places on each item. The goal is to allocate the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here are the total valuations for each agent across all items:

- **Agent 0's valuations:** 20 + 35 + 65 + 11 + 42 + 93 + 30 + 50 = 346
- **Agent 1's valuations:** 12 + 30 + 89 + 33 + 57 + 32 + 68 + 95 = 416

The aim is to allocate items to each agent such that their perceived value of the allocation is as equal as possible, and no agent envies the other based on the allocation they receive.

To do this, we can use the following approach:

1. **Sort items by the difference in valuations between the two agents:** This helps identify items that are more valuable to one agent compared to the other.
2. **Allocate items to balance total valuation:** Aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's sort the items by the absolute difference in valuations between the two agents:

- Item 5: |93 - 32| = 61 (Agent 0 values it much more)
- Item 2: |65 - 89| = 24 (Agent 1 values it more)
- Item 7: |50 - 95| = 45 (Agent 1 values it much more)
- Item 6: |30 - 68| = 38 (Agent 1 values it more)
- Item 4: |42 - 57| = 15 (Agent 1 values it more)
- Item 1: |35 - 30| = 5 (Agent 0 values it slightly more)
- Item 3: |11 - 33| = 22 (Agent 1 values it more)
- Item 0: |20 - 12| = 8 (Agent 0 values it more)

Now, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0:** Item 5 is significantly more valuable to Agent 0.
2. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:** Item 2 is significantly more valuable to Agent 1.
3. **Allocate Item 7 to Agent 1:** Item 7 is significantly more valuable to Agent 1.
4. **Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1:** Item 6 is more valuable to Agent 1.
5. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1:** Item 4 is more valuable to Agent 1.
6. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:** Item 1 is slightly more valuable to Agent 0.
7. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1:** Item 3 is more valuable to Agent 1.
8. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0:** Item 0 is slightly more valuable to Agent 0.

This allocation gives:

- **Agent 0:** Items 5, 1, 0
- **Agent 1:** Items 2, 7, 6, 4, 3

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 0],
    "1": [2, 7, 6, 4, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent and minimizes envy.
