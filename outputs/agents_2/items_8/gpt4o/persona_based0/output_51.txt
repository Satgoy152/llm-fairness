Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  16  47  36  96  28  90  98
1  71  55  53  62   9   3  86  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive. We'll aim to allocate the items such that neither agent would prefer the other's allocation over their own, given their respective valuations.

Letâ€™s start by evaluating possible allocations:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 4 (96) and 7 (98).
   - Agent 1 has a high valuation for items 0 (71) and 6 (86).

2. **Fair Division Strategy:**
   - Assign items to maximize the total valuation for each agent.
   - Check if the allocation is envy-free or adjust accordingly.

3. **Allocation:**
   - Assign item 4 and item 7, which are highly valued by Agent 0.
   - Assign item 0 and item 6, which are highly valued by Agent 1.
   - Distribute remaining items to balance the valuations.

Let's go through the allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 4, 7
  - Total value: 96 + 98 = 194

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 0, 6
  - Total value: 71 + 86 = 157

Now, allocate the remaining items (1, 2, 3, 5):

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 and item 1 to Agent 1:
  - Agent 0: 4, 7, 2
    - Total value: 194 + 47 = 241
  - Agent 1: 0, 6, 1
    - Total value: 157 + 55 = 212

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 and item 5 to Agent 1:
  - Agent 0: 4, 7, 2, 3
    - Total value: 241 + 36 = 277
  - Agent 1: 0, 6, 1, 5
    - Total value: 212 + 3 = 215

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations and distributes the total value fairly, given the constraints.

**Final Allocation in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 6, 1, 5]
}
```
