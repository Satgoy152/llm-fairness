Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  67  97  83  29  96  22  52
1  56   3  22  32   1  85   5  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. Let's evaluate the situation:

### Step 1: Analyze the Valuations
Agent 0's valuations: [97, 67, 97, 83, 29, 96, 22, 52]  
Agent 1's valuations: [56, 3, 22, 32, 1, 85, 5, 74]

### Step 2: Sort Items by Each Agent's Valuation
To make an allocation that is fair and envy-free, we should consider giving each agent the items they value most. Let's first list items in descending order of their valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0's Sorted Valuation:**
  1. Item 0: 97
  2. Item 2: 97
  3. Item 5: 96
  4. Item 3: 83
  5. Item 1: 67
  6. Item 7: 52
  7. Item 4: 29
  8. Item 6: 22

- **Agent 1's Sorted Valuation:**
  1. Item 5: 85
  2. Item 7: 74
  3. Item 0: 56
  4. Item 3: 32
  5. Item 2: 22
  6. Item 6: 5
  7. Item 1: 3
  8. Item 4: 1

### Step 3: Initial Allocation Proposal
Let's allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while keeping the number of items equal.

1. **Agent 0**: Higher value items [0, 2, 5, 3]
2. **Agent 1**: Higher value items [7, 6, 4, 1]

### Step 4: Check for Envy-Freeness and Adjust if Needed
- Agent 0's total value from these items: 97 (Item 0) + 97 (Item 2) + 96 (Item 5) + 83 (Item 3) = 373
- Agent 1's total value from these items: 74 (Item 7) + 5 (Item 6) + 1 (Item 4) + 3 (Item 1) = 83

Clearly, we need to balance this allocation better to ensure envy-freeness. Let's swap some items to reduce the gap in total valuations.

### Step 5: Adjusted Allocation
Reallocate items to balance the total valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: [0, 2, 5]
   - Total value: 97 + 97 + 96 = 290
2. **Agent 1**: [3, 1, 7, 6, 4]
   - Total value: 32 + 3 + 74 + 5 + 1 = 115

### Final Allocation
Even though balance is tricky, given the constraints and the need to allocate all items, this tries to minimize total envy considering integer allocations. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed while attempting to maximize each agent's valuation based on their preferences.
