Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  63  92  67  79   7  57  37
1  26  87  89  31  13  60  29   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that attempts to minimize envy and considers the valuations provided by each agent, we can use the concept of envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's first summarize the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [0, 63, 92, 67, 79, 7, 57, 37]
Agent 1: [26, 87, 89, 31, 13, 60, 29, 3]
```

To find an envy-free allocation, we can use the strategy of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent's allocated items:

1. **Assign Item 2 (highest value for Agent 0):**  
   Agent 0 values item 2 at 92, while Agent 1 values it at 89.  
   Assign to Agent 0: Item 2.

2. **Assign Item 1 (second highest value for Agent 1):**  
   Agent 1 values item 1 at 87, while Agent 0 values it at 63.  
   Assign to Agent 1: Item 1.

3. **Assign Item 4 (next highest value for Agent 0):**  
   Agent 0 values item 4 at 79, while Agent 1 values it at 13.  
   Assign to Agent 0: Item 4.

4. **Assign Item 0 (next highest value for Agent 1):**  
   Agent 1 values item 0 at 26, while Agent 0 values it at 0.  
   Assign to Agent 1: Item 0.

5. **Assign Item 3 (next highest value for Agent 0):**  
   Agent 0 values item 3 at 67, while Agent 1 values it at 31.  
   Assign to Agent 0: Item 3.

6. **Assign Item 5 (next highest value for Agent 1):**  
   Agent 1 values item 5 at 60, while Agent 0 values it at 7.  
   Assign to Agent 1: Item 5.

7. **Assign Item 6 (next highest value for Agent 0):**  
   Agent 0 values item 6 at 57, while Agent 1 values it at 29.  
   Assign to Agent 0: Item 6.

8. **Assign Item 7 (remaining item):**  
   Assign to Agent 1: Item 7.

The allocations for each agent are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 0, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their respective valuations, while ensuring that all items are assigned.
