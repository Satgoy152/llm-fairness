Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  64   6  68  65  62  67  60
1  99  23  74   1  46  41  98  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute them such that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their own valuations.

The total valuations for each agent are:

- Agent 0 values: 28, 64, 6, 68, 65, 62, 67, 60
  - Total value: 28 + 64 + 6 + 68 + 65 + 62 + 67 + 60 = 420

- Agent 1 values: 99, 23, 74, 1, 46, 41, 98, 81
  - Total value: 99 + 23 + 74 + 1 + 46 + 41 + 98 + 81 = 463

The goal is to allocate the items so that each agent receives approximately half of their total valuation, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

To achieve this, we can use a method where each agent receives items that maximize their valuation while keeping the total values they receive balanced. We can begin by considering the highest valued items for each agent and allocate accordingly.

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0's Highest Valuations:**
   - Items: 3 (68), 6 (67), 4 (65), 1 (64)

2. **Agent 1's Highest Valuations:**
   - Items: 0 (99), 6 (98), 7 (81), 2 (74)

Since both agents highly value item 6, it becomes a point of contention. To balance the allocation and ensure envy-freeness, we need to adjust by considering the next highest valued items for each agent after initial allocation attempts.

**Optimal Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:**
  - Allocated items: 1 (64), 3 (68), 4 (65), 5 (62)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Allocated items: 0 (99), 2 (74), 6 (98), 7 (81)

This allocation gives:

- **Agent 0 Total Value:**
  - 64 + 68 + 65 + 62 = 259

- **Agent 1 Total Value:**
  - 99 + 74 + 98 + 81 = 352

Both agents receive an allocation that reflects a fair share relative to their valuations, balancing the high-value items between them.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 6, 7]
}
```
