Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  44  73  10  37  94  69  60
1  16  46  50  28  95  96  46  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [16 46 50 28 95 96 46 42]]
Output:
To ensure a fair allocation between the two agents while minimizing envy, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. We need to assign the items so that both agents feel that they are receiving a fair share of the total value.

Let's calculate the total value of all items for each agent:
- Agent 0: 29 + 44 + 73 + 10 + 37 + 94 + 69 + 60 = 416
- Agent 1: 16 + 46 + 50 + 28 + 95 + 96 + 46 + 42 = 419

Now, let's try to allocate items to maximize fairness:

1. **Step 1**: Start by identifying the items with the highest valuations for each agent. This helps in potentially reducing envy.
   - Highest values for Agent 0: Item 5 (94), Item 2 (73), Item 6 (69)
   - Highest values for Agent 1: Item 5 (96), Item 4 (95), Item 2 (50)

2. **Step 2**: Allocate items to balance the total valuation for each agent, while considering their preferences.
    - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it more at 96 compared to Agent 0's 94).
    - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it more at 73 compared to Agent 1's 50).
    - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it at 95).

3. **Step 3**: Continue allocation by considering remaining values and striving for balance.
    - Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 69).
    - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 29).
    - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 46).
    - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 28).
    - Assign Item 7 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 60).

Let's check the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 6, 0, 7] = 73 + 69 + 29 + 60 = 231
- Agent 1: Items [5, 4, 1, 3] = 96 + 95 + 46 + 28 = 265

The allocations are fairly balanced given the initial total valuations, ensuring both agents receive a significant portion of their total value.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 0, 7],
    "1": [5, 4, 1, 3]
}
```
