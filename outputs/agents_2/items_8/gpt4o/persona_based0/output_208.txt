Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  41  78  26  90  81  46  38
1  29  54  91  28  18  67  90  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we want to consider concepts such as envy-freeness, where no agent would prefer the items allocated to the other agent over their own allocation. We will aim to balance the total valuations each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 68 + 41 + 78 + 26 + 90 + 81 + 46 + 38 = 468
- Agent 1's total valuation: 29 + 54 + 91 + 28 + 18 + 67 + 90 + 89 = 466

Both agents have similar total valuations, so a fair division should aim to distribute the items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is roughly equal.

Using a simple approach, we will attempt to allocate items by maximizing the valuations each agent receives for the items they are allocated while keeping the total perceived values balanced:

1. **Allocate items to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 4 (90) and item 5 (81). 
   - Let's also consider item 2 (78) and item 0 (68) to balance the valuation.

2. **Allocate items to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (91) and item 6 (90).
   - Let's also consider item 7 (89) and item 5 (67) to balance the valuation.

Let's summarize this allocation:

- **Agent 0's Allocation:**
  - Items: 0 (68), 2 (78), 4 (90), 5 (81)
  - Total valuation: 68 + 78 + 90 + 81 = 317

- **Agent 1's Allocation:**
  - Items: 1 (54), 3 (28), 6 (90), 7 (89)
  - Total valuation: 54 + 28 + 90 + 89 = 261

Both agents receive 4 items each, and the total allocations sum to 8 items, as required.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
