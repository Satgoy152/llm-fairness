Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  90  98  73  83  41  61   9
1  14  57  51  28  42  38  47  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [14 57 51 28 42 38 47 89]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free division, where each agent feels they received the best allocation based on their valuations. We have two agents (0 and 1) and eight items (0 through 7).

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 58 + 90 + 98 + 73 + 83 + 41 + 61 + 9 = 513
   - Agent 1: 14 + 57 + 51 + 28 + 42 + 38 + 47 + 89 = 366

2. **Divide Items Based on Valuation:**
   - The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring no envy between them.

3. **Sort Items by Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's sorted items by value: [2, 1, 4, 3, 0, 6, 5, 7]
   - Agent 1's sorted items by value: [7, 1, 2, 6, 4, 3, 5, 0]

4. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent, ensuring no duplication, and considering the total number of items.

5. **Allocate Items to Maximize Value:**
   - Agent 0 receives items: 2, 1, 4
   - Agent 1 receives items: 7, 6, 3, 5, and 0

### Final Allocation:

After ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and attempting to balance the total value each agent perceives, we arrive at the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 4],
    "1": [7, 6, 3, 5, 0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with the maximum value possible from their perspective, minimizing envy and maximizing fairness.
