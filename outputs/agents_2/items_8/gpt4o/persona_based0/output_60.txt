Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  75  72   6  77  43  30  20
1  90  30  65  63  79  57  20  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[75 75 72  6 77 43 30 20]
 [90 30 65 63 79 57 20 82]]
Output:
To ensure a fair and envy-free allocation of items among the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to balance the total value each agent receives. Envy-freeness implies that no agent should prefer the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent and aim for an allocation that minimizes envy:

Agent 0's valuations: [75, 75, 72, 6, 77, 43, 30, 20]
Agent 1's valuations: [90, 30, 65, 63, 79, 57, 20, 82]

First, calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent:
- Total valuation for Agent 0: 75 + 75 + 72 + 6 + 77 + 43 + 30 + 20 = 398
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 90 + 30 + 65 + 63 + 79 + 57 + 20 + 82 = 486

The goal is to divide these items so that the perceived total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. Assign high-value items to each agent while balancing their total perceived value:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 75) and item 4 to Agent 1 (value 79).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 75) and item 3 to Agent 1 (value 63).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 72) and item 5 to Agent 1 (value 57).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 30) and item 7 to Agent 1 (value 82).

2. Check the total perceived value for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 75 + 75 + 72 + 30 = 252
   - Agent 1: 79 + 63 + 57 + 82 = 281

3. The allocations are reasonably balanced given the constraints and should minimize envy.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
