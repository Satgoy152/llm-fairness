Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  48  46   4   6  53   9  78
1  96  50  61  63  56  36  62  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [96 50 61 63 56 36 62 49]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we will aim to make the allocation envy-free, ensuring that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the other's allocation based on their respective valuations.

Let's first note the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \(25 + 48 + 46 + 4 + 6 + 53 + 9 + 78 = 269\)
- Agent 1: \(96 + 50 + 61 + 63 + 56 + 36 + 62 + 49 = 473\)

Next, we'll attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0's highest valued items: 7 (78), 5 (53), 1 (48)
   - Agent 1's highest valued items: 0 (96), 3 (63), 2 (61)

2. **Allocate highest valued items to each agent:**
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Continue allocation by balancing remaining high-value preferences:**
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest preference).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest preference).

4. **Allocate remaining items to balance total valuations:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

5. **Distribute the remaining lower-valued items:**
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:

By this distribution, we aim to balance the agents' total valuations as closely as possible and ensure an envy-free allocation.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a distribution of items that respects their preferences as much as possible, given the constraints of the problem. Agent 0 receives items with a total valuation of \(48 + 6 + 53 + 78 = 185\), and Agent 1 receives items with a total valuation of \(96 + 61 + 63 + 62 = 282\).
