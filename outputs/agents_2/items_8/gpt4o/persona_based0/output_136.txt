Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  45  24  65  81  47  92  79
1  11   2   0  86  61  36  21  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation of their allocated items, while ensuring no agent envies the other's allocation. A simple approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share in terms of total value.

Let's compute the total valuation for different allocations:

1. **Item Valuations:**

   - Agent 0's valuations: [3, 45, 24, 65, 81, 47, 92, 79]
   - Agent 1's valuations: [11, 2, 0, 86, 61, 36, 21, 26]

2. **Allocating items to the agent with the highest valuation for each item:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 3, Agent 1 values it at 11 → Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 values it at 2 → Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 values it at 0 → Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 values it at 86 → Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 values it at 61 → Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 values it at 36 → Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 21 → Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 values it at 26 → Assign to Agent 0

3. **Resulting Allocation:**

   - Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 3]

4. **Total Valuations for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0's total valuation = 45 + 24 + 81 + 47 + 92 + 79 = 368
   - Agent 1's total valuation = 11 + 86 = 97

This allocation maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their individual valuations and ensures that all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
