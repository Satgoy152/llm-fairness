Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  90   1  74   5  28  15  29
1  36  45  40  35  99  38  55  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among two agents based on their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as the bundle allocated to the other agent according to their own valuation.

Let's examine each agent's total valuation for all items and attempt to balance the allocations:

**Agent 0's total valuation:**
- \(65 + 90 + 1 + 74 + 5 + 28 + 15 + 29 = 307\)

**Agent 1's total valuation:**
- \(36 + 45 + 40 + 35 + 99 + 38 + 55 + 91 = 439\)

An envy-free allocation aims to give each agent at least half of their total valuation. Let's attempt an allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items with highest value for Agent 0: 1, 0, 3, 7
   - Allocate items: 0, 1, 3, 7
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: \(65 + 90 + 74 + 29 = 258\)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Remaining items for Agent 1: 2, 4, 5, 6
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: \(40 + 99 + 38 + 55 = 232\)

This allocation is not envy-free since Agent 1 values their bundle less than half of their total valuation. Letâ€™s try a different allocation focusing on making the distribution more balanced:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Allocate items: 0, 1, 3
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: \(65 + 90 + 74 = 229\)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Allocate items: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: \(40 + 99 + 38 + 55 + 91 = 323\)

This allocation is better but still not envy-free. Another approach could be to balance the values:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Allocate items: 0, 3, 5, 7
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: \(65 + 74 + 28 + 29 = 196\)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Allocate items: 1, 2, 4, 6
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: \(45 + 40 + 99 + 55 = 239\)

This allocation seems more balanced in terms of total valuations:

- Agent 0: 196
- Agent 1: 239

Let's finalize this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
