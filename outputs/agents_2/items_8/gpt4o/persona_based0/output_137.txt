Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  87  74  44  40  93  93  13
1  77  83  95  93  87  84  31  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. One method to achieve this is by using the "Envy-Free" allocation principle, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as what they would get if they swapped with the other agent.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [20, 87, 74, 44, 40, 93, 93, 13]
- Agent 1: [77, 83, 95, 93, 87, 84, 31, 53]

Let's follow a strategy that focuses on maximizing each agent's individual value, while considering the overall fairness:

1. Sort item valuations for each agent.
2. Allocate items in a way that tries to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 5 (93), which Agent 1 values at 84.
2. The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 2 (95), which Agent 0 values at 74.

Now, let's allocate some key high-value items to balance the total value:

- Assign item 5 (93) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 (95) to Agent 1.

Continue with this strategy:

- Assign item 1 (87) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 (93) to Agent 1.

Now check remaining high-value items:

- Assign item 6 (93) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 (87) to Agent 1.

Now we have:

- Agent 0 has items: [5, 1, 6]
- Agent 1 has items: [2, 3, 4]

Allocate remaining items:

- Assign item 0 (20) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 7 (53) to Agent 1.

Now, both agents have 4 items each. Let's verify allocations by value:

- Agent 0's total value: 93 (item 5) + 87 (item 1) + 93 (item 6) + 20 (item 0) = 293
- Agent 1's total value: 95 (item 2) + 93 (item 3) + 87 (item 4) + 53 (item 7) = 328

The allocations ensure each agent gets items, and the total valuation is reasonably balanced. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 6, 0],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
