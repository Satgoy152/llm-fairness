Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  44  80  44  34  70   6  87
1  47  19  88  65  49  54  14  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the value each agent has for each item and attempt to balance the distribution so that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation. We will aim to make the total valuation for each agent as equal as possible given the constraints.

Let's consider the total valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(14 + 44 + 80 + 44 + 34 + 70 + 6 + 87 = 379\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(47 + 19 + 88 + 65 + 49 + 54 + 14 + 19 = 355\)

The goal is to divide the items such that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: Start with items that Agent 0 values highly, while considering Agent 1's valuations to prevent significant imbalance.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items to Agent 1 that maintain or restore balance, focusing on items that Agent 1 values significantly more than Agent 0.

### Step-by-step Allocation

- **Item 2**: Give to Agent 1 (88 vs. 80) – higher value for Agent 1.
- **Item 7**: Give to Agent 0 (87 vs. 19) – higher value for Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Give to Agent 1 (65 vs. 44) – higher value for Agent 1.
- **Item 5**: Give to Agent 0 (70 vs. 54) – higher value for Agent 0.
- **Item 0**: Give to Agent 1 (47 vs. 14) – higher value for Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Give to Agent 0 (44 vs. 19) – higher value for Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Give to Agent 1 (49 vs. 34) – higher value for Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Give to Agent 0 (6 vs. 14) – lower value for Agent 0, but balances total valuation.

### Final Allocation

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 5, 7, 6]
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 2, 3, 4]

### Valuation Check

- **Agent 0's final valuation**: \(44 + 70 + 87 + 6 = 207\)
- **Agent 1's final valuation**: \(47 + 88 + 65 + 49 = 249\)

The allocation attempts to balance the cumulative valuations while respecting individual preferences as much as possible.

{
    "0": [1, 5, 7, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
