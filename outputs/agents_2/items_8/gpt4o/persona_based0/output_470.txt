Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2  3   4   5   6   7
0   6  87  45  7  20  80  51  95
1  56  75  39  0  20  47  53   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve a distribution that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should feel that they receive a bundle of items that is at least as valuable as the bundle received by the other agent, according to their own valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 6 + 87 + 45 + 7 + 20 + 80 + 51 + 95 = 391
- Agent 1's total valuation: 56 + 75 + 39 + 0 + 20 + 47 + 53 + 7 = 297

Now, let's try to allocate the items in a way that attempts to balance the perceived total value for each agent.

### Allocating Items
1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items: 7 (95), 1 (87), 5 (80)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (56), 1 (75), 6 (53)

### Allocation Strategy
- Start by giving each agent their highest-valued items to ensure satisfaction.
- Adjust the allocation to maintain balance and fairness, considering the remaining items.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 1 (87), 5 (80), 7 (95)
  - Total Value: 87 + 80 + 95 = 262

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 0 (56), 2 (39), 3 (0), 4 (20), 6 (53)
  - Total Value: 56 + 39 + 0 + 20 + 53 = 168

### Review and Final Adjustment
After initial allocation, we see that Agent 0 has been allocated highly valued items. However, Agent 1's total valuation seems lower.

Reassign to balance the perceived fairness:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 1 (87), 5 (80), 2 (45)
  - Total Value: 87 + 80 + 45 = 212

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 0 (56), 3 (0), 4 (20), 6 (53), 7 (95)
  - Total Value: 56 + 0 + 20 + 53 + 95 = 224

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value by each agent and ensures all items are distributed.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation provides a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations, aiming to minimize envy while ensuring all items are allocated.
