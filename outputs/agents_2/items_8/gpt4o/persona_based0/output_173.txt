Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  43  71  12  84  92  37  92
1  86  55  64  55  23  37  95  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering the valuations they have for each item, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. This means each agent should feel that they received at least as much value as the other agent from their perspective.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 6 + 43 + 71 + 12 + 84 + 92 + 37 + 92 = 437
- Agent 1: 86 + 55 + 64 + 55 + 23 + 37 + 95 + 72 = 487

Next, we can aim to split the items in such a way that both agents get a similar total value according to their own valuations. We can approach this by iteratively allocating items to agents based on the relative values they assign to them.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 5** is valued highest by Agent 0 (92), so we assign it to Agent 0.
2. **Item 6** is valued highest by Agent 1 (95), so we assign it to Agent 1.
3. **Item 7** is valued equally by both agents (92 for Agent 0 and 72 for Agent 1), but Agent 0 values it more, so we assign it to Agent 0.
4. **Item 0** is valued highest by Agent 1 (86), so we assign it to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4** is valued highest by Agent 0 (84), so we assign it to Agent 0.
6. **Item 2** is valued more by Agent 0 (71), so we assign it to Agent 0.
7. **Item 3** is valued equally by both agents (12 for Agent 0 and 55 for Agent 1), but Agent 1 values it more, so we assign it to Agent 1.
8. **Item 1** is valued more by Agent 1 (55), so we assign it to Agent 1.

Now we check the total valuation for each agent based on our allocation:

- Agent 0: 92 (Item 5) + 92 (Item 7) + 84 (Item 4) + 71 (Item 2) = 339
- Agent 1: 95 (Item 6) + 86 (Item 0) + 55 (Item 3) + 55 (Item 1) = 291

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free since there's some imbalance, but it does reflect an attempt to balance high-value items across agents.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 6]
}
```
