Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17   7  37  90  28  95  99  97
1  37  39  51  20  31  56  98  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that envy-freeness is considered, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. We also want to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, meaning each agent should feel that they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's start by examining the total valuations that each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 17 + 7 + 37 + 90 + 28 + 95 + 99 + 97 = 470
- Agent 1's total valuation: 37 + 39 + 51 + 20 + 31 + 56 + 98 + 41 = 373

Now, let's attempt to allocate items to each agent such that they are as satisfied as possible:

1. Sort the items based on the difference in valuation between the two agents.
2. Allocate items that have a higher valuation difference favoring one agent to that agent first.
3. Continue this process while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation process:

- Item 5: Agent 0 (95) vs. Agent 1 (56) - Allocate to Agent 0
- Item 7: Agent 0 (97) vs. Agent 1 (41) - Allocate to Agent 0
- Item 3: Agent 0 (90) vs. Agent 1 (20) - Allocate to Agent 0
- Item 6: Agent 0 (99) vs. Agent 1 (98) - Allocate to Agent 0 (difference is minimal)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (37) vs. Agent 1 (51) - Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 0: Agent 0 (17) vs. Agent 1 (37) - Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 1: Agent 0 (7) vs. Agent 1 (39) - Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 4: Agent 0 (28) vs. Agent 1 (31) - Allocate to Agent 1

Now, let's ensure each agent has received items:

- Agent 0 receives items: 5, 7, 3, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 0, 1, 4

Finally, here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items, and the allocation attempts to minimize envy by allocating items based on the differences in their valuations.
