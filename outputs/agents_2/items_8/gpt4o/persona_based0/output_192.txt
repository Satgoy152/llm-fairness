Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  40  11  87  47  21  29  97
1  91  82  22  73   0  54  47  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [41, 40, 11, 87, 47, 21, 29, 97]
- Agent 1's valuations: [91, 82, 22, 73, 0, 54, 47, 94]

Total valuations for each agent:
- Total value for Agent 0: 41 + 40 + 11 + 87 + 47 + 21 + 29 + 97 = 373
- Total value for Agent 1: 91 + 82 + 22 + 73 + 0 + 54 + 47 + 94 = 463

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we want to balance the perceived value each agent receives. Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Assign the highest-valued item to Agent 0.
2. Then, assign the highest-valued item from the remaining items to Agent 1.
3. Continue this process alternately until all items are allocated.

Following this strategy:

- Agent 0 gets item 7 (value 97), Agent 1 gets item 0 (value 91)
- Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 87), Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 82)
- Agent 0 gets item 4 (value 47), Agent 1 gets item 5 (value 54)
- Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 29), Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 22)

Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0's allocated items: [7, 3, 4, 6]
- Agent 1's allocated items: [0, 1, 5, 2]

Now, we will present the allocations in the required JSON format.

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 2]
}
```
