Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  64  66  36  68  95  78  11
1  61   1  39  88  28   6  53   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation based on their valuations.

Let's first look at the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 26 + 64 + 66 + 36 + 68 + 95 + 78 + 11 = 444
- Agent 1's total valuation: 61 + 1 + 39 + 88 + 28 + 6 + 53 + 1 = 277

Ideally, we would like to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.

We can use the following strategy to allocate items:

1. Identify the item with the highest valuation for each agent.
2. Allocate this item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Repeat the process for the remaining items until all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 5 has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (95). Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. Item 3 has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (88). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Item 6 has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (78). Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
4. Item 4 has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (68). Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
5. Item 2 has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (66). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
6. Item 1 has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (64). Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
7. Item 0 has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (61). Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
8. Item 7 has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (11). Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible.
