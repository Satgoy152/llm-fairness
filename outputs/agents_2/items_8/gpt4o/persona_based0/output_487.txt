Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  93  71  86  30  52  91  78
1  15  47  16  95  80  81   4  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly and ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their preferences.

Here is the given valuation table for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   90   |   93   |   71   |   86   |   30   |   52   |   91   |   78   |
|   1   |   15   |   47   |   16   |   95   |   80   |   81   |   4    |   96   |

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0's Highest Valuations:**
   - Item 1: 93
   - Item 0: 90
   - Item 6: 91
   - Item 3: 86

2. **Agent 1's Highest Valuations:**
   - Item 7: 96
   - Item 3: 95
   - Item 5: 81
   - Item 4: 80

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Since agent 0 highly values item 1, item 0, item 6, and item 3, we can start by giving them these items.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 7, item 3, item 5, and item 4. However, item 3 is also highly valued by agent 0. To maintain fairness, we will give agent 1 the items they value most that aren't already allocated to agent 0.

**Allocations:**

- Assign item 1, item 0, and item 6 to agent 0. This satisfies their highest valuations.
- Assign item 7 to agent 1, as it is their highest value item.
- Assign item 3 to agent 0, as they also value it highly, and agent 1 has already received a high-value item (item 7).
- Assign item 5 and item 4 to agent 1, as they are the next highest valuation items for agent 1.
- Finally, assign items 2 to agent 0 to balance the number of items.

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5, 7]
}
```

Both agents have received items, and all 8 items are allocated.
