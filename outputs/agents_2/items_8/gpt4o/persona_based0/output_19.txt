Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  49  47  15  88   9  25  86
1  18  16  77  60  26  35  87  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim for an envy-free or proportional allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another over their own. A proportional allocation guarantees that each agent receives at least their fair share of the total value.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 89 + 49 + 47 + 15 + 88 + 9 + 25 + 86 = 408
- Agent 1's total valuation: 18 + 16 + 77 + 60 + 26 + 35 + 87 + 58 = 377

Next, determine each agent's fair share of the total value:

- Each agent's fair share is half of their total valuation since there are two agents:
  - Agent 0's fair share: 408 / 2 = 204
  - Agent 1's fair share: 377 / 2 = 188.5

Now, we need to assign items such that each agent gets at least their fair share in terms of value, while ensuring that there is no envy if possible.

Let's start by considering each agent's highest-valued items and allocating items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0's highest-valued items**: 0 (89), 4 (88), 7 (86)
2. **Agent 1's highest-valued items**: 6 (87), 2 (77), 3 (60)

Allocate high-value items to each agent to reach or exceed their fair share:

- Assign items 0, 4, and 7 to Agent 0:
  - Total value for Agent 0: 89 + 88 + 86 = 263 (exceeds 204)

- Assign items 6, 2, and 3 to Agent 1:
  - Total value for Agent 1: 87 + 77 + 60 = 224 (exceeds 188.5)

Now we have allocated 6 out of 8 items. We need to allocate the remaining items (1 and 5) while maintaining fairness:

- Item 1 has values: Agent 0 (49), Agent 1 (16)
- Item 5 has values: Agent 0 (9), Agent 1 (35)

To balance the allocation in terms of fairness and minimize envy:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0:
  - New total value for Agent 0: 263 + 49 = 312

- Assign item 5 to Agent 1:
  - New total value for Agent 1: 224 + 35 = 259

This allocation should minimize envy as Agent 0 receives more total valuation, but Agent 1 is not far behind and has received high-priority items.

Finally, here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7, 1],
    "1": [6, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
This allocation ensures that both agents receive an integer number of items, with each agent receiving at least their fair share and minimizing envy between them.
