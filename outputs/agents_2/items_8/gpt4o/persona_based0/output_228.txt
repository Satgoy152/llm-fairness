Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  52  91  91  30  80  38  57
1  78  53  95  79  58  37   9  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 53 95 79 58 37  9 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 63 + 52 + 91 + 91 + 30 + 80 + 38 + 57 = 502
- Agent 1: 78 + 53 + 95 + 79 + 58 + 37 + 9 + 89 = 498

Since the total values are similar, we can attempt to split the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while keeping the total value of allocations approximately equal.

We'll proceed by finding allocations:

1. Sort items based on the difference in valuation between the two agents.
2. Allocate items where the difference is largest to the agent who values them more.

Sorted items by the difference in valuation (Agent 0 - Agent 1):

- Item 6: 38 - 9 = 29 (Agent 0 prefers)
- Item 2: 91 - 95 = -4 (Agent 1 prefers)
- Item 0: 63 - 78 = -15 (Agent 1 prefers)
- Item 5: 80 - 37 = 43 (Agent 0 prefers)
- Item 7: 57 - 89 = -32 (Agent 1 prefers)
- Item 3: 91 - 79 = 12 (Agent 0 prefers)
- Item 1: 52 - 53 = -1 (Agent 1 prefers)
- Item 4: 30 - 58 = -28 (Agent 1 prefers)

Allocate items based on preferences:

- Agent 0 gets items: 6, 5, 3
- Agent 1 gets items: 2, 0, 7, 1, 4

Total valuation for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0: 38 (item 6) + 80 (item 5) + 91 (item 3) = 209
- Agent 1: 95 (item 2) + 78 (item 0) + 89 (item 7) + 53 (item 1) + 58 (item 4) = 289

Both agents receive items they value highly, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 3],
    "1": [2, 0, 7, 1, 4]
}
```
