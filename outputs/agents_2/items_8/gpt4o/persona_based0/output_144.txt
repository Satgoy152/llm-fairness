Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  95  10  17  72  71  50  95
1  96  76  79  17  79  56   2  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness generally means that no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to the other agent over their own bundle.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to achieve a fair distribution:

Agent 0's valuations: [46, 95, 10, 17, 72, 71, 50, 95]  
Agent 1's valuations: [96, 76, 79, 17, 79, 56, 2, 54]

First, let's calculate the total value each agent attributes to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 46 + 95 + 10 + 17 + 72 + 71 + 50 + 95 = 456
- Total value for Agent 1: 96 + 76 + 79 + 17 + 79 + 56 + 2 + 54 = 459

The values are close, so we aim to allocate items such that the perceived total value for each agent is approximately equal.

Let's start allocating items based on the highest valuation for each agent:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it higher (96 vs. 46). Allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it higher (95 vs. 76). Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it higher (79 vs. 10). Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Both value equally (17 vs. 17). Allocate to any. Let's allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it higher (72 vs. 79). Allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it higher (71 vs. 56). Allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it higher (50 vs. 2). Allocate to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it higher (95 vs. 54). Allocate to Agent 0.

Let's review the allocation:

- Agent 0 has items [1, 3, 5, 6, 7]
- Agent 1 has items [0, 2, 4]

Now let's sum the total value perceived by each agent:

- Total for Agent 0: 95 + 17 + 71 + 50 + 95 = 328
- Total for Agent 1: 96 + 79 + 79 = 254

The allocation slightly favors Agent 0. Let's adjust by reallocating Item 7, which is valued equally (or close) by both agents, to Agent 1 to balance better:

- Agent 0 has items [1, 3, 5, 6]
- Agent 1 has items [0, 2, 4, 7]

Recalculate the totals:

- Total for Agent 0: 95 + 17 + 71 + 50 = 233
- Total for Agent 1: 96 + 79 + 79 + 54 = 308

This allocation is better balanced, considering agent preferences.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 7]
}
```
