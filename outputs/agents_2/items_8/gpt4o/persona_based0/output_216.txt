Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  58  90  68  23  43  14  47
1  79  12  79  11  32  79  84  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that they have received at least as much value from their allocated items as they would from the other agent's allocation.

Let's evaluate the total valuations and see how we can allocate the items:

Agent 0's valuations: [91, 58, 90, 68, 23, 43, 14, 47]  
Agent 1's valuations: [79, 12, 79, 11, 32, 79, 84, 77]

One way to approach a fair allocation is to consider giving each agent items that maximize their individual valuations while also balancing the total values fairly evenly.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**  
   - Agent 0 values items 0, 2, and 3 highly.
   - Agent 1 values items 2, 5, 6, and 7 highly.

2. **Allocate High-Value Items:**
   - Give item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Give item 2 to Agent 0 because it has a slightly higher value for Agent 0 than Agent 1.
   - Give item 6 to Agent 1 (high value for Agent 1).
   - Give item 5 to Agent 1 (high value for Agent 1).

3. **Allocate Remaining Items to Balance Value:**
   - Give item 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1).
   - Give item 7 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0).
   - Give item 3 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1).
   - Give item 4 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0).

### Final Allocation:

By considering the above allocations, we ensure that each agent gets items they value highly, while trying to balance the overall perceived value each one receives.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation provides a balanced division of the items based on each agent's preferences, aiming for an envy-free or as close to envy-free division as possible given the constraints.
