Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  7  73  89  15   7  18  83  76
1  9  71  12  97  45  15  41  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

The valuations given are:

```
Agent 0: [7, 73, 89, 15, 7, 18, 83, 76]
Agent 1: [9, 71, 12, 97, 45, 15, 41, 44]
```

We can use the following strategy to allocate items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Start by identifying items with high values for each agent and allocate these items to the respective agents.

2. **Balance Remaining Value**: After allocating high-value items, distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness**: Ensure that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is not less than the valuation they would assign to the other's allocation.

**Allocation Steps:**

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 (89), 6 (83), and 7 (76).
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 3 (97).

After assigning these high-value items, we need to distribute the remaining items to ensure a fair and envy-free allocation.

**Allocation:**

- Give items 2, 6, and 7 to Agent 0 since they value them highly.
- Give item 3 to Agent 1 as it is highly valued by them.
- Distribute the remaining items (0, 1, 4, 5) to balance the total valuations.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 gets items: 2, 6, 7, 4
- Agent 1 gets items: 3, 0, 1, 5

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 a total valuation of: 89 (item 2) + 83 (item 6) + 76 (item 7) + 7 (item 4) = 255
- Agent 1 a total valuation of: 97 (item 3) + 9 (item 0) + 71 (item 1) + 15 (item 5) = 192

Both agents receive a fair share based on their item valuations, and the allocation is envy-free.

**Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 7, 4],
    "1": [3, 0, 1, 5]
}
```
