Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  37  67  96  34  52   6  51
1  13  23  74  41  26   1  25  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. An envy-free allocation means that each agent feels they have received a bundle of items that is at least as valuable as the bundle received by the other agent, based on their own valuations. While achieving perfect envy-freeness might not always be possible, we can strive to minimize envy.

Let's list the items and their valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 37
  - Item 2: 67
  - Item 3: 96
  - Item 4: 34
  - Item 5: 52
  - Item 6: 6
  - Item 7: 51

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 13
  - Item 1: 23
  - Item 2: 74
  - Item 3: 41
  - Item 4: 26
  - Item 5: 1
  - Item 6: 25
  - Item 7: 41

We can approach this allocation by trying to maximize the total value for each agent while keeping the distribution as fair as possible. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Allocate items with the highest differential in favor of one agent to that agent.
2. Balance the remaining items to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

### Allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2, 0, and 6.

Let's allocate based on these preferences:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 96 for Agent 0, 41 for Agent 1).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 74 for Agent 1, 67 for Agent 0).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 52 for Agent 0, 1 for Agent 1).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 13 for Agent 1, 7 for Agent 0).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value 51 for Agent 0, 41 for Agent 1).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 25 for Agent 1, 6 for Agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 37 for Agent 0, 23 for Agent 1).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 26 for Agent 1, 34 for Agent 0).

This allocation attempts to balance the overall value each agent receives while considering their strongest preferences. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 7, 1],
    "1": [2, 0, 6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives four items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.
