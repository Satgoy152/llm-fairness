Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  57  89  75  87  98  88  73
1  91  58  37  36  84  34  99  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes fairness.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Agent 0's valuations for items: [49, 57, 89, 75, 87, 98, 88, 73]
- Agent 1's valuations for items: [91, 58, 37, 36, 84, 34, 99, 50]

To achieve a fair division, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of utilities while trying to ensure envy-freeness. A simple heuristic approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while keeping the total value as balanced as possible.

Here is one potential allocation:

1. Compare each item's value for both agents and assign it to the agent who values it more.
2. Adjust the allocation if necessary to keep the distribution balanced, ensuring both agents get a similar total value.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (91 vs 49).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (57 vs 58).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (89 vs 37).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (75 vs 36).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (87 vs 84).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (98 vs 34).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (99 vs 88).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (73 vs 50).

After the first allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 6

Now, let's check the total value each agent receives:

- Total value for Agent 0 = 57 + 89 + 75 + 87 + 98 + 73 = 479
- Total value for Agent 1 = 91 + 99 = 190

This allocation is heavily skewed towards Agent 0. Let's redistribute some items to balance the values more evenly. We can give item 4 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values item 4 almost as much as Agent 0 does, and similarly, we can give item 7 to Agent 1.

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's check the values again:

- Total value for Agent 0 = 57 + 89 + 75 + 98 = 319
- Total value for Agent 1 = 91 + 84 + 99 + 50 = 324

This distribution is much more balanced.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
