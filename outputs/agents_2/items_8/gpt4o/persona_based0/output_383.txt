Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  97  40  64   6  65  37  78
1  24  90  48  91  48  74  61   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the allocation of the other agent over their own. In this context, each agent will receive an integer number of items and the sum of their valuations should be as balanced as possible to minimize envy.

Let's first calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent:

- For Agent 0: 
  - Total valuation = 52 + 97 + 40 + 64 + 6 + 65 + 37 + 78 = 439

- For Agent 1:
  - Total valuation = 24 + 90 + 48 + 91 + 48 + 74 + 61 + 9 = 445

Since both agents have similar total valuations, we'll aim to distribute items such that both agents end up with a similar total valuation for their allocated items.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Agent 0 is allocated items: 0, 1, 5, 7
  - Valuation for Agent 0 = 52 + 97 + 65 + 78 = 292

- Agent 1 is allocated items: 2, 3, 4, 6
  - Valuation for Agent 1 = 48 + 91 + 48 + 61 = 248

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 292 and Agent 1 a total valuation of 248. Although not perfectly balanced, it is relatively close given the constraints and aims to minimize envy as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
