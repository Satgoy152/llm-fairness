Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48   9  86  88  52  24  65  43
1  45  83  96  13  10  81  40  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while considering their respective valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we will attempt to balance the total value each agent receives. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that they are getting at least as much value as the other agent, based on their own valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0's total value: 48 + 9 + 86 + 88 + 52 + 24 + 65 + 43 = 415
- Agent 1's total value: 45 + 83 + 96 + 13 + 10 + 81 + 40 + 43 = 411

Now, let's aim to allocate the items such that the perceived value for both agents is as balanced as possible. We'll make preliminary allocations and adjust them as needed:

1. **Initial allocation based on high-value items:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 5.

2. **Trial allocation:**
   - Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign items 1 and 5 to Agent 1.

Let's see how this affects the remaining items and values:

**Agent 0:**
- Items: 2 (86), 3 (88)
- Total value: 86 + 88 = 174

**Agent 1:**
- Items: 1 (83), 5 (81)
- Total value: 83 + 81 = 164

Remaining items: 0, 4, 6, 7

3. **Allocate remaining items to balance:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 and 6 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 1.

**Final Allocation:**

**Agent 0:**
- Items: 2 (86), 3 (88), 4 (52), 6 (65)
- Total value: 86 + 88 + 52 + 65 = 291

**Agent 1:**
- Items: 0 (45), 1 (83), 5 (81), 7 (43)
- Total value: 45 + 83 + 81 + 43 = 252

The final allocation ensures that both agents perceive their allocation as valuable based on their individual valuations, achieving a balance in terms of total perceived value and maintaining envy-freeness. 

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 7]
}
```
