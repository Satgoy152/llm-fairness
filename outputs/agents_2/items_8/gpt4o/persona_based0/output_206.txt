Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  68  29  26  70  26  25  55
1  53  31  88  48  48  25  97  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that envy-freeness is achieved as much as possible, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's perceived value of the items they receive. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's bundle of items over their own.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [87, 68, 29, 26, 70, 26, 25, 55]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [53, 31, 88, 48, 48, 25, 97, 33]

To achieve a fair allocation, we should try to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive, while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation.

One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items based on the highest value for each agent. Here's how it could work:

1. Start with the item that has the highest valuation for any agent.
2. Allocate this item to the agent who values it most.
3. Remove this item from consideration and repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Let's apply this process:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 values it at 53. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 29, Agent 1 values it at 88. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 values it at 97. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 values it at 31. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 values it at 48. Allocate to Agent 0.
6. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 values it at 33. Allocate to Agent 0.
7. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 values it at 48. Allocate to Agent 1.
8. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 values it at 25. Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation should result in each agent receiving a bundle that minimizes envy:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 1, 4, 5, 7]
- Agent 1 receives items: [2, 3, 6]

Now, in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
