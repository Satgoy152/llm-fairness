Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  14  26  49  17  41  70  61
1  69  30  93  78  56  79  71  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents, we'll use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. This means we'll aim to allocate the items in a way that each agent gets what they value most while keeping their total valuations as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate and allocate the items step by step:

1. **Initial Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [1, 14, 26, 49, 17, 41, 70, 61]
   - Agent 1: [69, 30, 93, 78, 56, 79, 71, 86]

2. **Comparing Valuations for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 1, Agent 1 values it at 69. -> Agent 1 should receive it.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 values it at 30. -> Agent 1 should receive it.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 values it at 93. -> Agent 1 should receive it.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 values it at 78. -> Agent 1 should receive it.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 17, Agent 1 values it at 56. -> Agent 1 should receive it.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 values it at 79. -> Agent 1 should receive it.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 values it at 71. -> Agent 1 should receive it.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 86. -> Agent 1 should receive it.

3. **Adjusting for Fairness:**
   - We notice that Agent 1 values all items higher than Agent 0, except for item 6, where their valuations are very close. To ensure fairness, we reallocate some items to Agent 0.
   - We can give items 3, 5, and 6 to Agent 0, as these items have relatively high value for Agent 0.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [3, 5, 6]
   - Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 4, 7]

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations while minimizing envy.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8, and it takes into account the relative valuations of both agents to achieve fair division.
