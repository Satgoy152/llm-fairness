Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  91  10  32  80  59  76  79
1  52  63   1  52   3  47  41  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which aims to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as the allocation received by the other agent. Given the valuations, let's work through the allocation process step-by-step.

First, let's sum up the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(22 + 91 + 10 + 32 + 80 + 59 + 76 + 79 = 449\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(52 + 63 + 1 + 52 + 3 + 47 + 41 + 71 = 330\)

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels that they have received a fair share relative to their total valuation.

To achieve this, let's try to allocate items by comparing the relative valuations of each item between the two agents. We will allocate an item to the agent who values it more, provided that it leads to a balanced overall distribution of items.

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (52 vs. 22), so allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (91 vs. 63), so allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (10 vs. 1), so allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Both agents value it equally (32 vs. 52, but Agent 1 has more items), so allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (80 vs. 3), so allocate to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (59 vs. 47), so allocate to Agent 0.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (76 vs. 41), so allocate to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (71 vs. 79, but Agent 0 already has many items), so allocate to Agent 1.

This allocation results in an imbalance in the number of items. Let's adjust it:

Let's reallocate item 6 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it significantly more compared to other remaining items, and it helps balance the items.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 6, 7

This allocation gives Agent 0 five items and Agent 1 three items, but this is a result of balancing valuations rather than number of items. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 6, 7]
}
```
