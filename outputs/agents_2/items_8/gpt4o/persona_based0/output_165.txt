Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  76  23  66  26  85  24  15
1   2  80  91  49  91  75   8   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as the other agent.

### Valuations:

- **Agent 0's Valuations**: [85, 76, 23, 66, 26, 85, 24, 15]
- **Agent 1's Valuations**: [2, 80, 91, 49, 91, 75, 8, 4]

### Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Each agent should ideally receive the items they value the most.
2. **Balancing Total Value**: We should ensure that the total allocated value is as balanced as possible between the agents.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 0 (85), 5 (85), 1 (76)
   - Let's allocate items 0 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (91), 4 (91), 1 (80)
   - Let's allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items left are: 1, 3, 6, 7

4. **Balancing Remaining Items**:
   - **Agent 0**: Allocates items 1 (76) and 3 (66) to Agent 0.
   - **Agent 1**: Allocates items 6 (8) and 7 (4) to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 1, 3, 5]
- **Agent 1**: [2, 4, 6, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly and the total valuation is reasonably balanced.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
