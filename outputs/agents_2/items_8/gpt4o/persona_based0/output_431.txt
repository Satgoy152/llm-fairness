Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  57   2  78   8  51  17  35
1  40  95  77  26  38  57  30  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided and try to distribute the items such that neither agent feels that another agent's allocation is strictly better than theirs, based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [11, 57, 2, 78, 8, 51, 17, 35]
Agent 1: [40, 95, 77, 26, 38, 57, 30, 98]
```

The total value for each agent if they were to receive all the items would be:

- Agent 0: 11 + 57 + 2 + 78 + 8 + 51 + 17 + 35 = 259
- Agent 1: 40 + 95 + 77 + 26 + 38 + 57 + 30 + 98 = 461

The goal is to allocate all 8 items in a way that balances these valuations as fairly as possible.

One common approach is to aim for each agent to get half of the total value of the items, which is (259 + 461) / 2 = 360. However, as we only have 8 items, achieving a perfect balance might not be possible, but we'll aim to get as close as possible.

Let's consider the items starting with the highest value for each agent and try to balance the distribution:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (95) and item 7 (98), so let's allocate these to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (78) and item 5 (51), so let's allocate these to Agent 0.
3. Next, Agent 1 highly values item 2 (77), so let's allocate it to Agent 1.
4. Agent 0 values item 1 (57), but it's already taken, so next is item 5 (51), allocated to Agent 0.
5. Agent 1 values item 5 (57), but it's already taken, so next is item 0 (40), allocated to Agent 1.
6. Agent 0 values item 7 (35), but it's already taken, so next is item 1 (57), allocated to Agent 0.
7. Agent 1 values item 4 (38), allocated to Agent 1.
8. Finally, Agent 0 gets item 0 (11).

Now, let's see the allocations:

- Agent 0: [3, 5, 1, 0]
- Agent 1: [1, 7, 2, 4]

Let's re-evaluate to ensure all items are allocated and no duplicates:

- Agent 0: 78 (3), 51 (5), 57 (1), 11 (0) = 197
- Agent 1: 95 (1), 98 (7), 77 (2), 38 (4) = 308

It seems I've made a mistake in my allocation as items were double-allocated. Let’s correct it:

1. **Agent 1**: [1, 7, 2, 4]
   - Total value: 95 (1) + 98 (7) + 77 (2) + 38 (4) = 308

2. **Agent 0**: [0, 3, 5, 6]
   - Total value: 11 (0) + 78 (3) + 51 (5) + 17 (6) = 157

Upon reconsideration and aiming for a more balanced distribution, here’s a feasible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 3, 5, 6, 0
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 7, 2, 4

Here’s the corrected allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6, 0],
    "1": [1, 7, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives, given their preferences, while ensuring envy is minimized under the constraints.
