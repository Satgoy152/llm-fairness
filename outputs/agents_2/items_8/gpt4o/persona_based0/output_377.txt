Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  99  84  57  44  46  55  31
1  17  63  19  54  73  29  39  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the agents while considering their valuations, we will aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over that of the other agent, based on their own valuations.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent of all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 45 + 99 + 84 + 57 + 44 + 46 + 55 + 31 = 461
- Agent 1's total valuation: 17 + 63 + 19 + 54 + 73 + 29 + 39 + 30 = 324

Next, we will try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's valuation while keeping the allocation as envy-free as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences (in descending order):**
   - Item 1: 99
   - Item 2: 84
   - Item 3: 57
   - Item 0: 45
   - Item 6: 55
   - Item 5: 46
   - Item 4: 44
   - Item 7: 31

2. **Agent 1's Preferences (in descending order):**
   - Item 4: 73
   - Item 1: 63
   - Item 3: 54
   - Item 6: 39
   - Item 5: 29
   - Item 7: 30
   - Item 0: 17
   - Item 2: 19

Let's allocate items starting with the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring no agent envies the other's allocation.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 1 (99), Item 2 (84), Item 0 (45), Item 5 (46)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 4 (73), Item 3 (54), Item 6 (39), Item 7 (30)

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 99 + 84 + 45 + 46 = 274, and Agent 1 a total valuation of 73 + 54 + 39 + 30 = 196.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 0, 5],
    "1": [4, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation considers both agents' preferences and aims to minimize envy by assigning items based on the highest individual valuations while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.
