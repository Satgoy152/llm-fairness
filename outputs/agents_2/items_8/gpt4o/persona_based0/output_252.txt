Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  32   9  49   8  37  20  10
1   2  45  53  91  68  30  76  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we can use a simple approach: each agent should perceive their allocation as at least as good as the allocation of the other agent, based on their own valuations.

Here are the steps to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** 
   - Agent 0: \( 98 + 32 + 9 + 49 + 8 + 37 + 20 + 10 = 263 \)
   - Agent 1: \( 2 + 45 + 53 + 91 + 68 + 30 + 76 + 67 = 432 \)

2. **Assign Items by Valuation:**
   - We aim to allocate items such that each agent's perceived value of their own allocation is maximized while ensuring all items are distributed.

3. **Greedy Allocation:** 
   - Start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most, iteratively checking to maintain a balance in the total value of items assigned to each agent.

4. **Allocation Process:**
   - Item 0: Value 98 to Agent 0 vs 2 to Agent 1. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Value 32 to Agent 0 vs 45 to Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Value 9 to Agent 0 vs 53 to Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Value 49 to Agent 0 vs 91 to Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Value 8 to Agent 0 vs 68 to Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Value 37 to Agent 0 vs 30 to Agent 1. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Value 20 to Agent 0 vs 76 to Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 7: Value 10 to Agent 0 vs 67 to Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1.

5. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items: [0, 5]
   - Agent 1 receives items: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
