Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  83  99  21  79  28   8  25
1  62  51  47   3  34  40  25  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. We will use the envy-free allocation principle, which attempts to give each agent a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's bundle over their own.

The given valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0: [88, 83, 99, 21, 79, 28, 8, 25]
- Agent 1: [62, 51, 47, 3, 34, 40, 25, 49]

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we'll start by assigning the items with the highest valuations for each agent, then balance the allocation by considering both the number of items and their total value.

1. **Assign high-value items**: 
   - Agent 0 highly values items 2 and 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 0 and 7.

2. **Avoid envy and balance**:
   - Focus on distributing items such that each agent has similar total valuation from their allocated items.

3. **Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives items: 2, 0, 5, 6
   - Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 4, 7

This distribution considers both the total valuation and attempts to minimize envy by balancing the allocations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives four items, utilizing all 8 items in total while considering their valuations.
