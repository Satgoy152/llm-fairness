Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  11  53  56  37  99  72  37
1   1  24  89  75  75  82   8  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their satisfaction based on their individual valuations. Our goal is to allocate the items such that the perceived value is balanced between the two agents, and neither agent feels envious of the other.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [65, 11, 53, 56, 37, 99, 72, 37]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 65 + 11 + 53 + 56 + 37 + 99 + 72 + 37 = 430

- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [1, 24, 89, 75, 75, 82, 8, 73]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 1 + 24 + 89 + 75 + 75 + 82 + 8 + 73 = 427

Given these totals, we aim to assign items such that each agent's perceived value is approximately balanced.

Now, let's allocate the items by considering each agent's valuation:

1. We start by identifying items that have a high disparity in valuation between the two agents, and allocate those to the agent who values them more. 

2. For items where the agents have similar valuations, we can allocate them to balance the overall value received by each agent.

Following this strategy, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 5, 6, 7
  - Total value for Agent 0: 65 + 99 + 72 + 37 = 273

- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 2, 3, 4
  - Total value for Agent 1: 24 + 89 + 75 + 75 = 263

This allocation makes sure that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a significant portion of their total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
