Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  71  24  25  79  55  10  49
1  55  89   7  76  48  56  79  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim for an envy-free division where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they would value the other agent's allocation. 

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 52, 71, 24, 25, 79, 55, 10, 49. The total value is \(52 + 71 + 24 + 25 + 79 + 55 + 10 + 49 = 365\).
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: 55, 89, 7, 76, 48, 56, 79, 87. The total value is \(55 + 89 + 7 + 76 + 48 + 56 + 79 + 87 = 497\).

To find a fair allocation, we will try to maximize the minimum value each agent perceives from their allocation.

Let's explore a possible allocation:

1. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 52.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 55.

2. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 71.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 89.

3. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 24.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 7.

4. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 25.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 76.

5. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 79.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 48.

6. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 5 at 55.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 at 56.

7. **Allocate item 6 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 6 at 10.
   - Agent 1 values item 6 at 79.

8. **Allocate item 7 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 7 at 49.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 at 87.

Now let's check the total value each agent perceives from their allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 5:
  - Total value for Agent 0: \(52 + 71 + 24 + 55 = 202\).
  
- Agent 1 receives items 3, 4, 6, and 7:
  - Total value for Agent 1: \(76 + 48 + 79 + 87 = 290\).

Both agents receive the items they value highly, and the allocation is fair under the given constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
