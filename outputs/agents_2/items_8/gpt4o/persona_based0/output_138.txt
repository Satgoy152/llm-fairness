Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  41  11  88  35  11  17   4
1  66   6  96  77  16  59  55  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the distribution is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An allocation is envy-free if each agent feels that their allocated bundle of items is at least as good as any other agent's bundle according to their valuations.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 30 + 41 + 11 + 88 + 35 + 11 + 17 + 4 = 237
- Agent 1's total valuation: 66 + 6 + 96 + 77 + 16 + 59 + 55 + 73 = 448

To achieve a fair allocation, we aim to balance the perceived value of the items each agent receives.

### Step-by-step Allocation Strategy:

1. **Highest Value First Approach**: Start by assigning each agent the items they value the most, alternating to ensure fairness.

2. **Assign High-Valued Items**:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (96). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (88). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

3. **Balance Remaining High-Value Items**:
   - Next high value for Agent 1 is item 0 (66). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Next high value for Agent 0 is item 1 (41). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

4. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (59), item 7 (73).
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (35), item 6 (17).

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 1, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 2, 0, 5, 7

This allocation attempts to balance the value each agent perceives from their set of items.

### JSON Format Output:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 0, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences and attempts to minimize envy between the agents.
