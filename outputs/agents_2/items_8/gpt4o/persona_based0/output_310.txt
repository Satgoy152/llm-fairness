Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  87  44  79  95  47  27  34
1  21  39  36  27  55  69  36  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while considering their valuations and the requirement for envy-freeness, we can use the following approach:

1. **Initial Analysis**: 
   - Agent 0's total valuation for all items: 66 + 87 + 44 + 79 + 95 + 47 + 27 + 34 = 479
   - Agent 1's total valuation for all items: 21 + 39 + 36 + 27 + 55 + 69 + 36 + 75 = 358

2. **Fairness and Envy-freeness**:
   - Aim for each agent to receive a fair share of the total value.
   - Fair share (approximate value per agent if values were perfectly divisible): 
     - Agent 0: 479 / 2 = 239.5
     - Agent 1: 358 / 2 = 179

3. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - The goal is to allocate items such that both agents feel they have received at least their fair share, considering their individual valuations.

4. **Greedy Allocation**:
   - Start by assigning the highest-valued items for each agent until their fair share is approximately met.
   - Swap items if necessary to better balance the fairness.

**Allocations**:
- Assign items to maximize each agent's perceived value while ensuring all items are allocated.

**Proposed Allocation**:
- Agent 0 will receive items: 0, 1, 4, 6
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 66 + 87 + 95 + 27 = 275
- Agent 1 will receive items: 2, 3, 5, 7
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 36 + 27 + 69 + 75 = 207

This allocation ensures both agents receive more than their approximate fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
