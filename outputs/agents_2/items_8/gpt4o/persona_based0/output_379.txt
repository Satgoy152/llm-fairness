Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  54  60  46  18   8  70  23
1  49  51  11  69  62  65  42  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints of this problem. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation received by the other, according to their own valuations.

Let's consider the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [72, 54, 60, 46, 18, 8, 70, 23]
- Agent 1: [49, 51, 11, 69, 62, 65, 42, 73]

First, we calculate the total value each agent attributes to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 72 + 54 + 60 + 46 + 18 + 8 + 70 + 23 = 351
- Total value for Agent 1: 49 + 51 + 11 + 69 + 62 + 65 + 42 + 73 = 422

To achieve a fair division, we need to assign the items such that both agents receive an approximately equal share of their perceived total value. Let's try to allocate the items by considering the highest value each agent has for the available items and ensuring both receive a fair share.

We can start by alternating the allocation based on the highest value each agent assigns to unallocated items, keeping track of the total value they receive:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 with 72, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 7 with 73, so we allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 1 highly values item 5 with 65, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 0 highly values item 6 with 70, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
5. Agent 1 highly values item 4 with 62, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
6. Agent 0 highly values item 2 with 60, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
7. Agent 0 highly values item 1 with 54, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
8. Agent 1 highly values item 3 with 69, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

Now, let's calculate the total value each agent receives from their allocated items:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 6, 2, 1] with values [72, 70, 60, 54], totaling 256.
- Agent 1 receives items [7, 5, 4, 3] with values [73, 65, 62, 69], totaling 269.

Both agents receive a substantial portion of their total perceived value, and the allocation is fairly balanced given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 2, 1],
    "1": [7, 5, 4, 3]
}
```
