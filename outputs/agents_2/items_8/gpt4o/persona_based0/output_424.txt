Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  67  57  44   4  42  61  14
1  25  76  17  75  74  59  67  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while minimizing envy, we can use a method that considers the preferences of both agents and attempts to balance the overall valuation. Given the valuations, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a set of items that they value highly, while ensuring that the total value of the items received by each agent is as balanced as possible. 

Firstly, let's look at the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 95 + 67 + 57 + 44 + 4 + 42 + 61 + 14 = 384
- Agent 1's total valuation: 25 + 76 + 17 + 75 + 74 + 59 + 67 + 31 = 424

We want to distribute the items to minimize the difference in perceived value by each agent. Here is a proposed allocation strategy:

1. Assign items with the highest disparity in valuations to the agent who values them more.
2. Balance the allocation by ensuring each agent receives a comparable total value.

Let's try this step-by-step:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 95, much higher than Agent 1's 25. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 76, higher than Agent 0's 67. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 57, much higher than Agent 1's 17. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 75, much higher than Agent 0's 44. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 74, much higher than Agent 0's 4. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 59, higher than Agent 0's 42. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 61, slightly less than Agent 1's 67. Assign to Agent 1 to balance the allocation.
- Item 7: Assign to Agent 0 to balance the allocation, as Agent 0 values it at 14 compared to Agent 1's 31.

Now let's see the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 7
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value for both agents while considering their preferences.
