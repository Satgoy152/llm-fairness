Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  36  91  24  89  68  47  68
1  79  69  52  99  93  94  61  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Envy-freeness is achieved when each agent values their own bundle of items at least as much as they value the bundle of items assigned to any other agent.

Let's first summarize the total valuations of each agent:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 48 + 36 + 91 + 24 + 89 + 68 + 47 + 68 = 471
- Agent 1 total valuation: 79 + 69 + 52 + 99 + 93 + 94 + 61 + 98 = 645

Now, let's consider a possible allocation of items that will aim to balance the perceived value by both agents. One approach is to allocate items by comparing the valuations and assigning items to the agent who values them more, while keeping track of the overall balance:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it higher (79 vs. 48) - Assign to Agent 1
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it higher (69 vs. 36) - Assign to Agent 1
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it higher (91 vs. 52) - Assign to Agent 0
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it higher (99 vs. 24) - Assign to Agent 1
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it higher (93 vs. 89) - Assign to Agent 1
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it higher (94 vs. 68) - Assign to Agent 1
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it higher (47 vs. 61) - Assign to Agent 0
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it higher (98 vs. 68) - Assign to Agent 1

This distribution seems to be skewed heavily in favor of Agent 1, which might not be entirely fair. Let's try to rebalance by ensuring that Agent 0 also gets a fair share of high-value items.

Revised distribution:

1. Item 0: Agent 1
2. Item 1: Agent 1
3. Item 2: Agent 0
4. Item 3: Agent 1
5. Item 4: Agent 0
6. Item 5: Agent 0
7. Item 6: Agent 1
8. Item 7: Agent 0

Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [2, 4, 5, 7]
- Agent 1 receives items: [0, 1, 3, 6]

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 91 (item 2) + 89 (item 4) + 68 (item 5) + 68 (item 7) = 316
- Agent 1 total valuation: 79 (item 0) + 69 (item 1) + 99 (item 3) + 61 (item 6) = 308

Both agents receive roughly balanced total valuations, promoting fairness and reducing envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 6]
}
```
