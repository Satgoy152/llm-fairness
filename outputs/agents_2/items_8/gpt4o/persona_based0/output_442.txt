Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  30  47  49  74  56  18  48
1  12  38   4   7  81  86  73   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 29 + 30 + 47 + 49 + 74 + 56 + 18 + 48 = 351
- Agent 1's total value: 12 + 38 + 4 + 7 + 81 + 86 + 73 + 9 = 310

Now, considering the valuations, let's attempt to allocate the items so that each agent receives a fair share of their total value.

1. Start by considering the highest valued items for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 74.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 at 86.

2. Assign the highest valued item to each agent:
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. Continue with the next highest valued items, ensuring the allocation remains fair:
   - Agent 0's next highest is item 3 at 49.
   - Agent 1's next highest is item 6 at 73.

4. Assign these items:
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

5. Continue the process:
   - Agent 0: item 2 at 47.
   - Agent 1: item 1 at 38.

6. Assign these items:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

7. The remaining items are 0, 7, and their valuations:
   - Agent 0: 29 (item 0), 18 (item 6).
   - Agent 1: 12 (item 0), 9 (item 7).

8. Assign the remaining items to balance the allocations:
   - Agent 0 receives item 0.
   - Agent 1 receives item 7.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 has items 0, 2, 3, and 4 with a total value of 29 + 47 + 49 + 74 = 199.
- Agent 1 has items 1, 5, 6, and 7 with a total value of 38 + 86 + 73 + 9 = 206.

The allocation is quite balanced in terms of valuations, and no agent envies the other's allocation based on the valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
