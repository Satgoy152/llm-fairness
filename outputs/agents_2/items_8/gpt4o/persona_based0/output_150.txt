Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  38  94  96  49  88  74  12
1  34  96  13  15  66  44  72  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while minimizing envy, we should aim for a division that considers the agents' valuations for each item. The goal is to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, meaning each agent feels they received at least as much value as the other, given the distribution of items.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [95, 38, 94, 96, 49, 88, 74, 12]
- Agent 1's valuations: [34, 96, 13, 15, 66, 44, 72, 24]

To minimize envy, we can try to allocate items such that each agent receives a similar total valuation across the items they receive. One approach is to start by allocating items with the highest value difference in favor of one agent:

1. **Agent 0 has a higher valuation for items 0, 2, 3, 5:**
   - Item 0: 95 vs. 34
   - Item 2: 94 vs. 13
   - Item 3: 96 vs. 15
   - Item 5: 88 vs. 44

2. **Agent 1 has a higher valuation for items 1, 4, 6, 7:**
   - Item 1: 38 vs. 96
   - Item 4: 49 vs. 66
   - Item 6: 74 vs. 72
   - Item 7: 12 vs. 24

We can start by allocating items based on which agent values them significantly more than the other:

- Allocate items 0, 2, 3, and 5 to Agent 0, as they have much higher valuations for these items.
- Allocate items 1, 4, 6, and 7 to Agent 1, as they have higher valuations for these items.

Let's verify the total valuation for each agent based on this allocation:

- **Agent 0 receives**: items [0, 2, 3, 5]
  - Total valuation: 95 + 94 + 96 + 88 = 373

- **Agent 1 receives**: items [1, 4, 6, 7]
  - Total valuation: 96 + 66 + 72 + 24 = 258

While Agent 0 receives a higher total valuation, the allocation is based on maximizing individual item valuations for each agent, which is a common approach in fair division to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
