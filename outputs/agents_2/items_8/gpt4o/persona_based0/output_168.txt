Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  91  52   2  43  80  81   9
1  20  60  15  12  58  57  37  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. We can use a method similar to the adjusted winner procedure to make sure the allocations are as fair as possible. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: \(11 + 91 + 52 + 2 + 43 + 80 + 81 + 9 = 369\)
   - Agent 1's total valuation: \(20 + 60 + 15 + 12 + 58 + 57 + 37 + 80 = 339\)

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it more, with ties broken arbitrarily.

3. **Check and Adjust for Envy-Freeness:**
   - Adjust allocations to ensure both agents feel they have received a fair share.

Let's proceed with these steps:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (11 vs. 20) → Give to Agent 1
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (91 vs. 60) → Give to Agent 0
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (52 vs. 15) → Give to Agent 0
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (2 vs. 12) → Give to Agent 1
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (43 vs. 58) → Give to Agent 1
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (80 vs. 57) → Give to Agent 0
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (81 vs. 37) → Give to Agent 0
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (9 vs. 80) → Give to Agent 1

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3, 4, 7]

**Total Valuations After Allocation:**

- Agent 0: \(91 + 52 + 80 + 81 = 304\)
- Agent 1: \(20 + 12 + 58 + 80 = 170\)

Since the allocations are heavily skewed towards Agent 0, we need to adjust to balance them better:

- Reassign Item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 1. 
- Reassign Item 6 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

**Adjusted Allocations:**

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

**Final Total Valuations:**

- Agent 0: \(91 + 52 = 143\)
- Agent 1: \(20 + 12 + 58 + 80 + 37 + 80 = 287\)

Agent 1 still receives more value, but this is the closest balance given the constraints. This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share relative to their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
