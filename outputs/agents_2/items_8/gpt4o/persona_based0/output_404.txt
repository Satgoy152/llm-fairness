Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  47  12  46  67  71  87  64
1  49  53  26   8   8  14  49  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we first need to assess the total valuations each agent has for all the items. Then, we'll allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \( 94 + 47 + 12 + 46 + 67 + 71 + 87 + 64 = 488 \)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \( 49 + 53 + 26 + 8 + 8 + 14 + 49 + 60 = 267 \)

Now, let's try to allocate the items in a way that balances these total valuations across the agents, ideally aiming for each agent to receive a portion of the combined valuations proportional to their total valuation.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 has a higher valuation for most items, we will start by assigning them items they value significantly more compared to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items that Agent 1 values more or items that have a relatively lower value for Agent 0.

#### Allocation:

- **Agent 0** receives:
  - Item 0 (94 vs 49)
  - Item 4 (67 vs 8)
  - Item 5 (71 vs 14)
  - Item 6 (87 vs 49)

- **Agent 1** receives:
  - Item 1 (47 vs 53)
  - Item 2 (12 vs 26)
  - Item 3 (46 vs 8)
  - Item 7 (64 vs 60)

Now, let's check the total valuation for each agent after this allocation:
- Agent 0's total valuation from the allocated items: \( 94 + 67 + 71 + 87 = 319 \)
- Agent 1's total valuation from the allocated items: \( 53 + 26 + 8 + 60 = 147 \)

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items that they value relatively high, trying to minimize envy and distribute the items fairly according to their perceived value.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of items based on their personal valuations.
