Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  32  28  88  25  98  29  25
1  27  83   8  10  68  59  94  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [27 83  8 10 68 59 94 75]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division where each agent feels they have received at least as much as the other agent in terms of their own valuations. 

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(36 + 32 + 28 + 88 + 25 + 98 + 29 + 25 = 361\)
- Agent 1: \(27 + 83 + 8 + 10 + 68 + 59 + 94 + 75 = 424\)

Now let's attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair share:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - High valuations: Item 5 (98), Item 3 (88)
   - Medium valuations: Item 0 (36), Item 1 (32), Item 6 (29), Item 2 (28), Item 4 (25), Item 7 (25)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - High valuations: Item 1 (83), Item 6 (94), Item 7 (75)
   - Medium valuations: Item 4 (68), Item 5 (59), Item 0 (27), Item 3 (10), Item 2 (8)

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Assign high-value items: Item 5 (98), Item 3 (88)
  - Supporting items: Item 6 (29), Item 4 (25)

  Total valuation for Agent 0: \(98 + 88 + 29 + 25 = 240\)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Assign high-value items: Item 1 (83), Item 6 (94), Item 7 (75)
  - Supporting items: Item 2 (8), Item 0 (27)

  Total valuation for Agent 1: \(83 + 94 + 75 + 8 + 27 = 287\)

Both allocations ensure that each agent receives items they value highly. Let's now present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3, 6, 4],
    "1": [1, 7, 2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of items based on their own valuations.
