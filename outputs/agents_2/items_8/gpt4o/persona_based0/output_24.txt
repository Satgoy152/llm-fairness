Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  77  55  68  55  22  35   2
1   8  68  80  75  14  29  91  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 8 68 80 75 14 29 91 80]]
Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly, we need to consider their valuations and attempt to achieve an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should feel that the items they receive are at least as valuable as the items received by the other agent.

Let's examine the valuations:

Agent 0: [84, 77, 55, 68, 55, 22, 35, 2]  
Agent 1: [8, 68, 80, 75, 14, 29, 91, 80]

The goal is to allocate all 8 items such that both agents are satisfied with their allocation.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items 0, 1, and 3 the highest.
   - Agent 1 values items 2, 3, 6, and 7 the highest.

2. **Mutual exclusion:**
   - Item 3 is valued highly by both agents. We'll need to decide based on remaining values.

3. **Initial allocation based on unique high values:**
   - Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0 (highly valued by Agent 0 but not Agent 1).
   - Allocate items 2, 6, and 7 to Agent 1 (highly valued by Agent 1 but not by Agent 0).

4. **Resolve item 3:**
   - Item 3 is highly valued by both. Since Agent 1 has already received high-value items, allocate item 3 to Agent 0 to balance the allocation.

5. **Allocate remaining items, ensuring balance:**
   - Items 4 and 5 are not particularly high in value for either agent, but Agent 1 receives item 5 to balance the distribution of total value, and item 4 goes to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

Based on the above reasoning and aiming for a fair distribution considering the agents' valuations, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5, 6, 7

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value, and the allocations are balanced as evenly as possible.

### JSON Format Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value for each agent, striving for an envy-free and fair division given their preferences.
