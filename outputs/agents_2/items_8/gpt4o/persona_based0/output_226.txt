Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  81  47  52  63  43   1  17
1  71  28  14  53  86  92  86  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the other agent's allocation. Given the table of valuations, let's determine a fair allocation.

Agent 0's valuations: [51, 81, 47, 52, 63, 43, 1, 17]  
Agent 1's valuations: [71, 28, 14, 53, 86, 92, 86, 21]

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 51 + 81 + 47 + 52 + 63 + 43 + 1 + 17 = 355
- Agent 1's total valuation: 71 + 28 + 14 + 53 + 86 + 92 + 86 + 21 = 451

Next, we attempt to allocate items so that each agent feels they have at least half of the total value of all items (403 in this case) and ideally minimizes envy.

A reasonable strategy is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total perceived value while trying to balance the total perceived value across agents.

After some calculations, a potential allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items [0, 1, 3, 6, 7]  
  - Total value for Agent 0: 51 + 81 + 52 + 1 + 17 = 202

- **Agent 1**: Allocate items [2, 4, 5]  
  - Total value for Agent 1: 47 + 86 + 92 = 225

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free, as Agent 1 has a higher total value in their allocation. However, given the constraints (integer number of items and the number of items), this is a reasonable attempt to split the items fairly.

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent receives items and all 8 items are allocated.
