Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4   2  78  39  93  57  61   9
1  58  28  10   9  79  75  66  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method that ensures each agent is happy with their allocation given their valuations. One common approach is to try and maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets approximately half of the total value of the items, if possible.

First, let's calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Total value for Agent 0: \(4 + 2 + 78 + 39 + 93 + 57 + 61 + 9 = 343\)
- Total value for Agent 1: \(58 + 28 + 10 + 9 + 79 + 75 + 66 + 49 = 374\)

Next, let's try to allocate the items in a way that aims to balance the perceived value for each agent:

1. Identify the items with the highest value for each agent and start by allocating items in such a way that maximizes their satisfaction.

2. Allocate items:

   - Agent 0 highly values items 4, 2, 6, and 5.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 0, 5, 6, and 4.

3. Considering both agents' preferences, we aim to allocate items to balance the perceived value:

   - Agent 0: Assign item 4 (93), item 2 (78), item 6 (61), item 3 (39)
   - Agent 1: Assign item 0 (58), item 5 (75), item 1 (28), item 7 (49)

Let's check the total value for each agent with this allocation:

- Total value for Agent 0: \(93 + 78 + 61 + 39 = 271\)
- Total value for Agent 1: \(58 + 75 + 28 + 49 = 210\)

This allocation attempts a fair division where each agent receives items that maximize their respective valuations, and the allocation considers envy-freeness by balancing the perceived value.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 7]
}
```
