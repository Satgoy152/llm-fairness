Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  42  36  27  77  10  78  23
1  64  14  63  71  42  29  29   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate the items to the agents in a way that is fair and envy-free, given the valuations. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent to their own, based on their valuations.

Let's first look at the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 50 + 42 + 36 + 27 + 77 + 10 + 78 + 23 = 343
- Agent 1's total valuation: 64 + 14 + 63 + 71 + 42 + 29 + 29 + 9 = 321

Now, we will try to allocate the items such that both agents are satisfied with their allocations.

We can use a simple algorithm to achieve this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it most.
2. Adjust the allocation if there is a significant imbalance in the total value received by each agent.

Let's assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (64) vs Agent 0 (50) → Agent 1
- Item 1: Agent 0 (42) vs Agent 1 (14) → Agent 0
- Item 2: Agent 1 (63) vs Agent 0 (36) → Agent 1
- Item 3: Agent 1 (71) vs Agent 0 (27) → Agent 1
- Item 4: Agent 0 (77) vs Agent 1 (42) → Agent 0
- Item 5: Agent 0 (10) vs Agent 1 (29) → Agent 1
- Item 6: Agent 0 (78) vs Agent 1 (29) → Agent 0
- Item 7: Agent 0 (23) vs Agent 1 (9) → Agent 0

Initially, this results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 4, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 3, 5]

Now, let's calculate the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0's total value: 42 (Item 1) + 77 (Item 4) + 78 (Item 6) + 23 (Item 7) = 220
- Agent 1's total value: 64 (Item 0) + 63 (Item 2) + 71 (Item 3) + 29 (Item 5) = 227

The total values are relatively close, and both agents receive a fair allocation based on their preferences. This allocation should be envy-free since each agent has been allocated items they value more highly than the other agent, given the division.

Therefore, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
