Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  46  19  88  69  93  30   2
1  32   7  24   1  32  16  38  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should feel that they received a fair share of the items based on their subjective valuations.

Let's look at the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 86 + 46 + 19 + 88 + 69 + 93 + 30 + 2 = 433
- Agent 1's total valuation: 32 + 7 + 24 + 1 + 32 + 16 + 38 + 30 = 180

Since there are two agents, we aim to allocate items such that each agent receives items that they value at approximately half of their total valuation (i.e., around 216.5 for agent 0 and 90 for agent 1).

Let's allocate the items to try to achieve this goal:

1. Start by assigning high-value items to Agent 0, as they have higher valuations overall, until we get close to 216.5.
2. Assign the remaining high-value items to Agent 1 to approach their target valuation of 90.

A possible allocation considering these valuations might look like this:

- Agent 0: Take items 0, 3, 5 (valuations: 86, 88, 93)
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 86 + 88 + 93 = 267

- Agent 1: Take items 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 (valuations: 7, 24, 32, 38, 30)
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 7 + 24 + 32 + 38 + 30 = 131

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an allocation of items, and the number of items allocated is exactly 8. While Agent 0 receives a higher valuation than Agent 1, it reflects their higher overall valuation capacity. Since we aim for an envy-free allocation on the basis of total valuations, this allocation is reasonably fair given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
