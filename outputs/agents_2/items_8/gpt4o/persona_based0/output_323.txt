Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  93  53  57   2  58  93  30
1   2  61  59   4  30  12  80  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents in a manner that is fair and envy-free, we must first understand each agent's valuations for the items and aim to maximize the total perceived value for each agent. We can try to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent values their own bundle at least as much as they value the other agent's bundle.

Here's a breakdown of the valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0's valuations:** [45, 93, 53, 57, 2, 58, 93, 30]
- **Agent 1's valuations:** [2, 61, 59, 4, 30, 12, 80, 44]

For a fair allocation, we can aim to allocate items such that:

1. Each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as the other agent's allocation.
2. Every item is allocated to one of the agents.

A possible approach is to allocate the items based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that the allocations are as balanced as possible.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has higher valuations for items 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.
2. **Agent 1** has a higher valuation for item 4.

To balance the allocations, we aim for a split where each agent has a similar total valuation from their allocated items.

By evaluating the total valuation for each possible allocation, we can allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 (Cumulative value = 45 + 93 + 57 + 58 + 93 = 346)
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 4, 7 (Cumulative value = 59 + 30 + 44 = 133)

We need to adjust this to make it more balanced:

By re-evaluating, we can adjust the allocation to:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 3, 6 (Cumulative value = 93 + 57 + 93 = 243)
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 2, 4, 5, 7 (Cumulative value = 2 + 59 + 30 + 12 + 44 = 147)

This allocation is more balanced in terms of total valuation perceived by each agent.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
