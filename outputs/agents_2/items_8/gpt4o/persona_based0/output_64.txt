Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  29  48  46  80  83   5  54
1  96  67  76  43   0  72  56  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 29 48 46 80 83  5 54]
 [96 67 76 43  0 72 56 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the total value, minimizing envy.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [91, 29, 48, 46, 80, 83, 5, 54]
- Agent 1's valuations: [96, 67, 76, 43, 0, 72, 56, 66]

First, we calculate the total value each agent perceives for all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 91 + 29 + 48 + 46 + 80 + 83 + 5 + 54 = 436
- Total value for Agent 1: 96 + 67 + 76 + 43 + 0 + 72 + 56 + 66 = 476

Next, we aim to allocate items so that the perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

We can proceed by allocating the items iteratively to ensure each agent's allocation maximizes their total perceived value while matching or minimizing the envy-freeness criterion. This often involves giving each agent the item they value most at each step until all items are allocated. 

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Allocate Item 0:** Agent 1 values this most (96 vs. 91). Assign to Agent 1.
2. **Allocate Item 5:** Agent 0 values this most (83 vs. 72). Assign to Agent 0.
3. **Allocate Item 4:** Agent 0 values this most (80 vs. 0). Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Allocate Item 6:** Agent 1 values this most (56 vs. 5). Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Allocate Item 2:** Agent 1 values this most (76 vs. 48). Assign to Agent 1.
6. **Allocate Item 7:** Agent 1 values this most (66 vs. 54). Assign to Agent 1.
7. **Allocate Item 1:** Agent 1 values this most (67 vs. 29). Assign to Agent 1.
8. **Allocate Item 3:** Agent 0 values this most (46 vs. 43). Assign to Agent 0.

After allocation, each agent has the following items:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2, 6, 7

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6, 7]
}
```
