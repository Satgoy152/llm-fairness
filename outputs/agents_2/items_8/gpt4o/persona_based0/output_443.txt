Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  29  89  83  14  47  52  88
1  12  66  23  73  80  82  65  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. A common approach to this problem is to allocate items in such a way that each agent's total valuation of their received items is as balanced as possible.

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 26 + 29 + 89 + 83 + 14 + 47 + 52 + 88 = 428
- Agent 1's total valuation: 12 + 66 + 23 + 73 + 80 + 82 + 65 + 62 = 463

To ensure fairness, we try to divide the items such that the total valuation for each agent is close to half of the combined total valuation of all items:

Total valuation of all items: 428 + 463 = 891

Each agent should aim to receive around half of this total valuation for a fair distribution, which is approximately 445.5.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Start by allocating the most valuable items to each agent, ensuring that their total valuations stay balanced.
2. We will iteratively assign items to the agent for whom the item provides the greatest proportional increase in their valuation relative to their current total.

By analyzing the valuations:

- Allocate item 2 and item 3 to Agent 0 (89 + 83 = 172).
- Allocate item 5 and item 4 to Agent 1 (82 + 80 = 162).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (88, total for Agent 0 = 172 + 88 = 260).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (66, total for Agent 1 = 162 + 66 = 228).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (52, total for Agent 0 = 260 + 52 = 312).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (12, total for Agent 1 = 228 + 12 = 240).

Final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 7, 6],
    "1": [5, 4, 1, 0]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations for each agent while making sure that all items are allocated. Each agent receives items such that their individual valuations are respected, and the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.
