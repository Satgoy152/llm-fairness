Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  38  53  21  71  72  42  49
1  97  48  12  59  64  22  45  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 48 12 59 64 22 45 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation and minimizes potential envy.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [89, 38, 53, 21, 71, 72, 42, 49]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [97, 48, 12, 59, 64, 22, 45, 94]

A common approach to achieve envy-freeness is to alternate assigning the items of highest value to each agent, ensuring a balance in total valuation.

1. Sort the items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents, prioritizing items where one agent has a significantly higher valuation.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 97, significantly higher than Agent 0's value of 89. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 48, higher than Agent 0's 38. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 53, significantly higher than Agent 1's 12. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 59, higher than Agent 0's 21. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 71, higher than Agent 1's 64. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 72, significantly higher than Agent 1's 22. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 45, slightly higher than Agent 0's 42. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 94, significantly higher than Agent 0's 49. Assign to Agent 1.

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 3, 6, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, aiming to achieve envy-freeness. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
