Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  53  97  64  92  90  74  40
1   9  86  62  84  34  77  26  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between two agents, we should aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own bundle. A common method for achieving this is by maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 14 + 53 + 97 + 64 + 92 + 90 + 74 + 40 = 524
- Agent 1's total valuation: 9 + 86 + 62 + 84 + 34 + 77 + 26 + 82 = 460

Now, we can proceed with the allocation of items, trying to ensure that each agent gets as close to an equal share of their total valuation as possible. Let's see how we can allocate these items:

1. Sort the items by the difference in valuation between the two agents, and allocate them to the agent who values them more, starting with the largest differences. This helps in achieving envy-freeness.

| Item Number | Agent 0 Valuation | Agent 1 Valuation | Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| 2           | 97                | 62                | 35                             |
| 5           | 90                | 77                | 13                             |
| 6           | 74                | 26                | 48                             |
| 4           | 92                | 34                | 58                             |
| 1           | 53                | 86                | -33                            |
| 3           | 64                | 84                | -20                            |
| 7           | 40                | 82                | -42                            |
| 0           | 14                | 9                 | 5                              |

2. Assign items based on the sorted differences:

- Agent 0 gets items 2, 5, 6, 4, and 0.
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 3, and 7.

Checking the total valuation:

- Agent 0's items: 2, 5, 6, 4, 0
  - Total value for Agent 0: 97 + 90 + 74 + 92 + 14 = 367
- Agent 1's items: 1, 3, 7
  - Total value for Agent 1: 86 + 84 + 82 = 252

This allocation aims to minimize envy, as each agent gets items they value highly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6, 4, 0],
    "1": [1, 3, 7]
}
```
