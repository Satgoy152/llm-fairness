Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  75  21  22  78  96  65  79
1  95  98  78  23  71  55  60  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents while minimizing envy, we can use a common approach called the "Envy-Free Allocation" method. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation, according to their valuations.

We have two agents, 0 and 1, and their valuations for each of the 8 items are given. The goal is to allocate these items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and ideally, no agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [52, 75, 21, 22, 78, 96, 65, 79]
- Agent 1: [95, 98, 78, 23, 71, 55, 60, 31]

To determine a fair allocation, we seek to maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items while trying to balance the perceived value of each agent's allocation to minimize envy.

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent and start by allocating them to the respective agents.
2. Ensure that the total number of items allocated equals 8, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.

Let's allocate based on the highest individual item valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (96), followed by item 7 (79) and item 4 (78).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (98), followed by item 0 (95) and item 2 (78).

**Allocation:**

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 and item 1 to Agent 1, as these are the highest valued items for each respective agent.
2. Agent 0 gets item 4 (78) and item 7 (79), which are among their next highest valued items.
3. Agent 1 gets item 0 (95) and item 2 (78), which are among their next highest valued items.
4. Distribute the remaining items (3 and 6) to balance the total count, ensuring total envy is minimized.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 will receive items: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Agent 1 will receive items: 0, 1, 2, 3

This allocation ensures both agents receive their high-value items while balancing the total value between them.

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items between the two agents according to their valuations, aiming to minimize envy and ensure fairness.
