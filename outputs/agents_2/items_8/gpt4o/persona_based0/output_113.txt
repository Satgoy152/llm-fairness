Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  17  63  66  66   2  35  24
1  18   5  50  85  97  21  41   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that the allocation is as balanced as possible based on the agents' valuations. The goal is to minimize the envy, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as the allocation of the other agent.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:**
   - Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 10 + 17 + 63 + 66 + 66 + 2 + 35 + 24 = 283
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 18 + 5 + 50 + 85 + 97 + 21 + 41 + 4 = 321

2. **Fair Division Approach:**
   - Ideally, divide the total value of items in such a way that neither agent feels the other has received more value.
   - Since the total valuation of items is 321 + 283 = 604, each agent should ideally receive items valued at approximately half of this total, adjusted by their own valuation scales.

3. **Assign Items:**
   - Consider the highest value items to each agent while ensuring the total value each agent receives is close to half of their total valuation.
   - Prioritize items where one agent has a significantly higher valuation than the other.

**Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: [2, 3, 5, 6]
  - Valuations: 63, 66, 2, 35
  - Total value for Agent 0: 63 + 66 + 2 + 35 = 166

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: [0, 1, 4, 7]
  - Valuations: 18, 5, 97, 4
  - Total value for Agent 1: 18 + 5 + 97 + 4 = 124

This allocation is balanced considering the high-value items are distributed to match their preferences and reduce potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation balances the total value as much as possible given the constraints and reduces potential envy by assigning high-value items in accordance with each agent's preferences.
