Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  92  13  19  82  37  71  72
1  39  90  91  94  25  31  74  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents while striving for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Envy-freeness in this context means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(36 + 92 + 13 + 19 + 82 + 37 + 71 + 72 = 422\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(39 + 90 + 91 + 94 + 25 + 31 + 74 + 32 = 476\)

To achieve envy-freeness, we will attempt to allocate items so that each agent's total value from their allocated items is roughly proportional to their valuation of all items.

### Allocation Approach:
1. **Individual Item Allocation:**
   - Calculate the difference in value each agent assigns to each item.
   - Prioritize giving items to the agent who values them significantly more than the other agent.

2. **Balanced Allocation:**
   - Ensure that the sum of the values for the allocated items for each agent is as balanced as possible, relative to their total valuation.

Here is a possible allocation based on the above considerations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items 1 (value 92), 4 (value 82), 6 (value 71), 7 (value 72)
  - Total value: \(92 + 82 + 71 + 72 = 317\)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items 0 (value 39), 2 (value 91), 3 (value 94), 5 (value 31)
  - Total value: \(39 + 91 + 94 + 31 = 255\)

This allocation aims to minimize envy by giving each agent items they value highly, while also keeping the total value of the allocations relatively balanced.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

This ensures that both agents receive a fair share according to their valuations, and all items are allocated.
