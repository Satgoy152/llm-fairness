Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  64  76  41  39  51  75  53
1  56  64  81  96  30  88  10  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free (if possible) or as fair as possible under the conditions, we should aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. 

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 27 + 64 + 76 + 41 + 39 + 51 + 75 + 53 = 426
- Agent 1's total valuation: 56 + 64 + 81 + 96 + 30 + 88 + 10 + 76 = 501

Next, we'll try to allocate items so that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. 

Let's start with a simple allocation strategy:

1. Assign items with closer valuations to both agents, considering their preferences.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 0, 2, 4, 5
  - Valuation: 27 (item 0) + 76 (item 2) + 39 (item 4) + 51 (item 5) = 193

- Agent 1: Allocate items 1, 3, 6, 7
  - Valuation: 64 (item 1) + 96 (item 3) + 10 (item 6) + 76 (item 7) = 246

Now, let's check if we can improve this allocation to reduce envy:

- Swap item 2 from Agent 0 with item 3 from Agent 1:
  - Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4, 5
    - Valuation: 27 + 96 + 39 + 51 = 213
  - Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 6, 7
    - Valuation: 64 + 81 + 10 + 76 = 231

This allocation is closer in valuation and can help reduce envy further.

Finally, presenting this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 6, 7]
}
```
