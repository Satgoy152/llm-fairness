Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  94  39  81  56   0  83  38
1  81  82  88  76  94  24  98  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between two agents, we can aim for an envy-free solution where each agent perceives their allocation to be at least as good as what the other agent has received. Given that we have two agents and eight items, we can try to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 52 + 94 + 39 + 81 + 56 + 0 + 83 + 38 = 443
- Agent 1: 81 + 82 + 88 + 76 + 94 + 24 + 98 + 20 = 563

To achieve a fair allocation, we need to ensure both agents receive a set of items that keeps them as close as possible to each other in terms of total valuation.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Highest Valuation Priority**: Assign items to each agent based on their highest valuation differences. This strategy will aim to maximize each agent's perceived value.

2. **Balancing Total Value**: While assigning items, continuously compare the total valuation each agent receives to keep them as balanced as possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

Consider assigning items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while trying to balance the total valuations:

- **Agent 0's highest valuations**: Item 1 (94), Item 6 (83), Item 3 (81)
- **Agent 1's highest valuations**: Item 6 (98), Item 4 (94), Item 2 (88)

1. **Assign Item 6 to Agent 1** (as 98 is highest overall value for this item):  
   - Agent 0: 0
   - Agent 1: 98

2. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0** (next highest valuation for Agent 0):  
   - Agent 0: 94
   - Agent 1: 98

3. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1** (next highest valuation for Agent 1):  
   - Agent 0: 94
   - Agent 1: 192

4. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 0** (next highest valuation for Agent 0):  
   - Agent 0: 175
   - Agent 1: 192

5. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 1** (next highest valuation for Agent 1):  
   - Agent 0: 175
   - Agent 1: 280

6. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0** (next highest valuation for Agent 0):  
   - Agent 0: 227
   - Agent 1: 280

7. **Assign Item 5 to Agent 1** (as Agent 1 has a better valuation, and it balances the totals better):  
   - Agent 0: 227
   - Agent 1: 304

8. **Assign Item 7 to Agent 0** (last remaining item):  
   - Agent 0: 265
   - Agent 1: 304

The allocations minimize envy since each agent receives items that maximize their personal valuations to the extent possible while keeping total valuations balanced.

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, with the total valuations being relatively balanced between the two agents.
