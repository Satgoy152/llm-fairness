Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  47  12  13  42  59  76  47
1  29  14   2  37  55  45  52  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[59 47 12 13 42 59 76 47]
 [29 14  2 37 55 45 52 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents using the principle of envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to allocate the items in such a way that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation. 

### Summary of Valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [59, 47, 12, 13, 42, 59, 76, 47]
- Agent 1's valuations: [29, 14, 2, 37, 55, 45, 52, 62]

### Total Valuation:

- Total valuation by Agent 0: 59 + 47 + 12 + 13 + 42 + 59 + 76 + 47 = 355
- Total valuation by Agent 1: 29 + 14 + 2 + 37 + 55 + 45 + 52 + 62 = 296

### Approach:

1. **Maximize Total Valuation:** Start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most.
2. **Check Envy-Freeness:** Ensure that the allocation is envy-free by ensuring that each agent does not feel they would prefer the other's allocation more than their own.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Allocate high-value items based on individual valuations:**
   - Item 6: Allocate to Agent 0 (76 > 52)
   - Item 0: Allocate to Agent 0 (59 > 29)
   - Item 5: Allocate to Agent 0 (59 > 45)
   - Item 7: Allocate to Agent 1 (62 > 47)
   - Item 4: Allocate to Agent 1 (55 > 42)
   - Item 3: Allocate to Agent 1 (37 > 13)
   - Item 1: Allocate to Agent 0 (47 > 14)
   - Item 2: Allocate to Agent 0 (12 > 2)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their valuation while keeping both agents' total valuations in mind. 

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 7]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items (5 for Agent 0 and 3 for Agent 1), and all items are allocated. This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation for each agent while considering their individual preferences as much as possible.
