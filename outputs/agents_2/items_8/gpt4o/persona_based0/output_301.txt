Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  50  35  91  21  32  13  75
1  53  27  56  37  22  14  32  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their individual utility while considering envy-freeness. This generally means allocating items such that no agent prefers another agentâ€™s bundle of items over their own, given their valuations.

Let's evaluate the situation given the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations: [0, 50, 35, 91, 21, 32, 13, 75]  
Agent 1's valuations: [53, 27, 56, 37, 22, 14, 32, 82]

First, let's sum up the total valuations for each agent:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 0 + 50 + 35 + 91 + 21 + 32 + 13 + 75 = 317  
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 53 + 27 + 56 + 37 + 22 + 14 + 32 + 82 = 323  

Given that both agents have similar total valuations, we should try to balance the allocations in a way that reflects their preferences.

To ensure fairness and minimize envy, let's look at each agent's highest-valued items and attempt to assign them accordingly, while also keeping an eye on the overall balance of the allocation.

1. **Assign Agent 0's highest-valued items:**
   - Item 3 (value 91)
   - Item 7 (value 75)
   - Item 1 (value 50)

2. **Assign Agent 1's highest-valued items:**
   - Item 0 (value 53)
   - Item 2 (value 56)
   - Item 7 (value 82) - However, Item 7 is already considered for Agent 0
   - Consider reallocating Item 7 to Agent 1 due to higher valuation by Agent 1 and giving Agent 0 another item

3. **Re-evaluate remaining items for balance:**
   - Agent 0: Items 3, 1
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 7
   - Remaining items: 4, 5, 6

4. **Allocate remaining items to balance the total valuation:**
   - Assign Item 6 (Agent 0 values it at 13 and Agent 1 values it at 32)
   - Assign Item 5 (Agent 0 values it at 32 and Agent 1 values it at 14)
   - Assign Item 4, giving Agent 0 a bit more value where they have a higher valuation (21 vs 22)

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [3, 1, 6, 4]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 7, 5]

The JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 6, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 7, 5]
}
```
