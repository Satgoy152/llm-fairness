Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  26  69  28  25  96  63  11
1  18  92   0  44  59  23  71  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that aims for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the other's allocation, given their own valuation. This problem can be approached by considering each agent's total valuation for all items and then distributing the items such that the perceived value aligns closely with each agent's preferences.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 99 + 26 + 69 + 28 + 25 + 96 + 63 + 11 = 417
- Agent 1's total valuation: 18 + 92 + 0 + 44 + 59 + 23 + 71 + 51 = 358

To balance these valuations, we need to allocate items in such a way that the perceived value is as equal as possible between the two agents.

One possible allocation strategy is as follows:

1. Allocate the items with the highest individual valuation to the respective agent, ensuring both agents receive roughly equal total values.

- Agent 0 highly values items 0 (99), 5 (96), and 2 (69).
- Agent 1 highly values items 1 (92), 6 (71), and 4 (59).

2. Distribute remaining items to maintain balance:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 (28) and 7 (11).
- Agent 1 receives item 5 (23).

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0's total value with items [0, 2, 3, 5, 7]: 99 + 69 + 28 + 96 + 11 = 303
- Agent 1's total value with items [1, 4, 6]: 92 + 59 + 71 = 222

Finally, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation strives for fairness by considering each agent's preferences and ensuring that both agents receive a fair share of the total perceived value.
