Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  61  85  97  72   6  24  29
1  28  53  65  26  19  52  34  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in order to minimize envy, we can consider an allocation that maximizes each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. The goal is to ensure that neither agent prefers the other's allocation over their own, making the allocation envy-free.

Let's evaluate the total valuations of different allocations and find a fair distribution. 

To find an envy-free allocation, we can try a simple approach by comparing the valuations and assigning items in a manner that balances the total value each agent receives.

Here is one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7
   - Total value: 94 (item 0) + 85 (item 2) + 97 (item 3) + 72 (item 4) + 29 (item 7) = 377

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: 1, 5, 6
   - Total value: 53 (item 1) + 52 (item 5) + 34 (item 6) = 139

This allocation gives Agent 0 a higher total valuation compared to Agent 1. Let's adjust until we achieve a more balanced distribution:

Another fair and potentially envy-free allocation could look like this:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: 0, 3, 5, 7
   - Total value: 94 + 97 + 6 + 29 = 226

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: 1, 2, 4, 6
   - Total value: 53 + 65 + 19 + 34 = 171

This allocation ensures both agents have a reasonable share of their valued items, with Agent 0 having a slightly higher total value. However, it balances the more highly valued items between the agents.

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation adheres to the envy-free principle by trying to balance the total valuations between the agents as evenly as possible given the constraints.
