Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36   4  49  53   0  54  85  76
1  94  58  59  98  81  23  48  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 58 59 98 81 23 48 37]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives an allocation where neither envies the other, if possible, based on their valuations.

Here are the agents' total valuations for all items:

- Agent 0's valuations: [36, 4, 49, 53, 0, 54, 85, 76]
- Agent 1's valuations: [94, 58, 59, 98, 81, 23, 48, 37]

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 36 + 4 + 49 + 53 + 0 + 54 + 85 + 76 = 357
- Total value for Agent 1: 94 + 58 + 59 + 98 + 81 + 23 + 48 + 37 = 498

Next, to achieve a fair allocation, we can attempt to maximize the minimum value that each agent receives while ensuring envy-freeness.

We will try to balance the distribution by considering high-value items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 6 (85) highly and item 7 (76).
- Agent 1 values item 3 (98) and item 0 (94) highly.

Let's create a fair allocation based on these high valuation preferences:

- Assign item 6 and item 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 and item 3 to Agent 1.

Now, allocate the remaining items [1, 2, 4, 5]:

- For Agent 0: Assign items 1, 2.
- For Agent 1: Assign items 4, 5.

The allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 6, 7, 1, 2 which sums to 85 + 76 + 4 + 49 = 214
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 3, 4, 5 which sums to 94 + 98 + 81 + 23 = 296

This allocation provides a balance where each agent receives a significant portion of their total valuation, reducing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
