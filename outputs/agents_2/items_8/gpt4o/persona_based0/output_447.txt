Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34   0   7  59  12  54  27  77
1  74  47  57  74  35  14   8   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to achieve an allocation where each agent receives a subset of items such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given that each agent values their set of items at least as much as the other agent's set.

The valuations for each agent are as follows:

- Agent 0: [34, 0, 7, 59, 12, 54, 27, 77]
- Agent 1: [74, 47, 57, 74, 35, 14, 8, 7]

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 34 + 0 + 7 + 59 + 12 + 54 + 27 + 77 = 270
- Total value for Agent 1: 74 + 47 + 57 + 74 + 35 + 14 + 8 + 7 = 316

Since Agent 1 values the items overall more than Agent 0, we should try to allocate items in a way that balances the perceived total value for each agent.

Let's allocate the items using a strategy that attempts to balance the total perceived value:

1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (valued at 59) and item 0 to Agent 1 (valued at 74) as they have high values for these items.
2. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (valued at 77) and item 1 to Agent 1 (valued at 47) as they have high values for these items.
3. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (valued at 54) and item 2 to Agent 1 (valued at 57) to balance out the remaining values.
4. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (valued at 27) and item 4 to Agent 1 (valued at 35) to finalize the allocation.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 7, 5, 6] with total value = 59 + 77 + 54 + 27 = 217
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 2, 4] with total value = 74 + 47 + 57 + 35 = 213

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free because Agent 0 has a slightly higher total value, but it balances the items as fairly as possible given the valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```
