Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  30  85  58  10  33  52  35
1  45  82  95  84  72  65  13  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent values their own bundle of items at least as much as they value the other agent's bundle. Given the preferences, this is a challenging problem, especially with integer allocations, but we can attempt to allocate based on maximizing each agent's total valuation.

Let's evaluate the total valuations for various allocations and aim to balance the value received by each agent.

### Steps:

1. **List the valuations for each item by each agent:**

   - Agent 0: [15, 30, 85, 58, 10, 33, 52, 35]
   - Agent 1: [45, 82, 95, 84, 72, 65, 13, 46]

2. **Sort the items by the difference in value that each agent has for them to prioritize items that significantly benefit one over the other.**

3. **Allocate the items to try and balance the total valuation each agent receives.**

From the table:

- Items 2, 3, 4, and 1 are highly valued by agent 1.
- Items 0, 6, 5, and 7 are more balanced but slightly favor agent 0.

### Allocation:

- Agent 0: Let's prioritize items 0, 5, 6, and 7 for Agent 0 as they have relatively more balanced values.
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3, and 4 are significantly more valuable to Agent 1.

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives, attempting to minimize envy.

### Calculating Total Valuations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: [0, 5, 6, 7]
  - Total Valuation: \(15 + 33 + 52 + 35 = 135\)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: [1, 2, 3, 4]
  - Total Valuation: \(82 + 95 + 84 + 72 = 333\)

Although Agent 1's total valuation is higher, this allocation reflects their stronger preferences for certain items, which is typical in envy-free allocations where preferences differ significantly. 

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the preferences and relative valuations of each agent given the constraints.
