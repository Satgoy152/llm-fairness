Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  54  90  41  94   5  17  86
1  20  55  18  40   5  73   5   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or as close to envy-free distribution as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer the set of items allocated to the other agent over their own set based on their valuations.

Let's summarize the valuations for clarity:

- Agent 0's valuations: [43, 54, 90, 41, 94, 5, 17, 86]
- Agent 1's valuations: [20, 55, 18, 40, 5, 73, 5, 1]

Total valuation for each agent across all items:
- Total for Agent 0: 430
- Total for Agent 1: 217

Ideally, we want to allocate items such that the perceived total valuation for each agent is as equal as possible. Here is a potential allocation:

1. Allocate items to Agent 0:
   - Items 0, 2, 4, 7 (valuations: 43, 90, 94, 86)

2. Allocate items to Agent 1:
   - Items 1, 3, 5, 6 (valuations: 55, 40, 73, 5)

Now, let's compute the total valuation each agent perceives from their allocated items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 43 + 90 + 94 + 86 = 313
- Agent 1's total valuation: 55 + 40 + 73 + 5 = 173

These totals are not perfectly balanced but represent a reasonable attempt to assign high-valued items to balance the perceived value. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance each agent's perceived value of their allocated items, given their individual valuations.
