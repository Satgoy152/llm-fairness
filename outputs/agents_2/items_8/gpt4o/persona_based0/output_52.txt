Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  81  23  54  81  22  83  32
1  23  89  77  91  44  11  49  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we will aim to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the other's allocation. This is a challenging problem since achieving perfect envy-freeness, where no agent would prefer another's allocation, is not always possible. However, we can attempt to minimize envy by making sure that each agent receives items they highly value.

We'll use a simple approach to allocate items by comparing the values each agent assigns to them, trying to ensure that each agent gets their most valued items.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 higher (89 vs. 81), so allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values item 3 higher (91 vs. 54), so allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 higher (39 vs. 23), so allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 4**: Both agents value item 4 equally (81 vs. 44), but since Agent 1 has already received two items, allocate to Agent 0 to balance the allocations.
5. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values item 6 higher (83 vs. 49), so allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values item 2 higher (77 vs. 23), so allocate to Agent 1.
7. **Item 7**: Agent 1 values item 7 higher (53 vs. 32), so allocate to Agent 1.
8. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values item 5 higher (22 vs. 11), so allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation gives each agent four items, and we've tried to allocate items based on their preferences to reduce envy.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 2, 7]
}
```
