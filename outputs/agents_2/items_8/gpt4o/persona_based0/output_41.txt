Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  86  21  62  51  14   7  78
1  54  42  31  94  53  12  22  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will take into account the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize each agent's total perceived value of their allocated items while ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation Per Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 28 + 86 + 21 + 62 + 51 + 14 + 7 + 78 = 347
   - Agent 1: 54 + 42 + 31 + 94 + 53 + 12 + 22 + 88 = 396

2. **Determine Initial Allocations:**
   - We will start by allocating the items based on the highest individual valuations by each agent to avoid envy.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Compare each item's valuation between the two agents and allocate it to the agent who values it more, while ensuring that both agents receive an equal or near-equal distribution of total value.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 (86) higher than Agent 1 (42).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 (94) higher than Agent 0 (62).
   - Continue this process for each item.

4. **Ensure Balance:**
   - After initial allocation, review the total value each agent has received and adjust by swapping items if needed to balance the total perceived value.

Following these steps, the allocations are:

- Agent 0 is allocated items: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Agent 1 is allocated items: 3, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive an equal number of items and the distribution is fair based on their valuations, minimizing envy.
