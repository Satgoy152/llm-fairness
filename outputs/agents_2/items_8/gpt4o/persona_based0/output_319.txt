Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  39  36  50  61  60  11  62
1  57   6  13  70   1  76  95  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57  6 13 70  1 76 95 62]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring envy-freeness, meaning each agent perceives their allocation to be at least as valuable as the other agent's allocation.

Let's summarize the value each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: [53, 39, 36, 50, 61, 60, 11, 62]
- Agent 1's valuations: [57, 6, 13, 70, 1, 76, 95, 62]

One way to approach this is to use a greedy algorithm where we allocate items one by one based on the highest relative value difference between the two agents for each item, ensuring that each agent feels they are getting a fair share.

Let's calculate the relative value difference for each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 values it at 57. Difference = 4.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 values it at 6. Difference = 33.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 values it at 13. Difference = 23.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 values it at 70. Difference = 20.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 1. Difference = 60.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 values it at 76. Difference = 16.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 11, Agent 1 values it at 95. Difference = 84.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 values it at 62. Difference = 0.

Now, let's allocate the items based on the largest difference, focusing on giving items to the agent who values them more:

1. Item 6 goes to Agent 1 (95 vs. 11).
2. Item 4 goes to Agent 0 (61 vs. 1).
3. Item 1 goes to Agent 0 (39 vs. 6).
4. Item 2 goes to Agent 0 (36 vs. 13).
5. Item 0 goes to Agent 1 (57 vs. 53).
6. Item 3 goes to Agent 1 (70 vs. 50).
7. Item 5 goes to Agent 1 (76 vs. 60).
8. Item 7 can go to either, as it is valued equally, but to balance the number of items, give it to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value, maximizing their perceived value while maintaining fairness.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
