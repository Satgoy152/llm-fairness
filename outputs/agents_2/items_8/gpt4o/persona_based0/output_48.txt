Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  52  61  18  29  82  56  84
1  11  87  25  48  24  36  41  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or ensuring that no agent envies the allocation of the other. This problem can be approached by attempting to balance the total value each agent receives from their allocated items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would derive from each item, and attempt to allocate them such that the difference in total value received by each agent is minimized.

**Step 1: Valuations**

- Agent 0's valuations: [70, 52, 61, 18, 29, 82, 56, 84]
- Agent 1's valuations: [11, 87, 25, 48, 24, 36, 41, 74]

**Step 2: Allocation Strategy**

Given the agentsâ€™ valuations, let's try to allocate the items to balance the total value received by each:

1. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (84 value) because it has a high value for them, and it will help balance later allocations.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (87 value) because it's their highest valued item.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (70 value) because it is highly valued by them and less by Agent 1.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (48 value) to balance out the total.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (82 value) as it continues to maximize their total without significant envy.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (25 value) as lower priority based on remaining items.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (41 value) to further balance totals.
8. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (29 value) as a final balance.

**Step 3: Calculate Totals**

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 3, 6

**Final Allocations:**

- Agent 0's total value: 70 + 29 + 82 + 84 = 265
- Agent 1's total value: 87 + 25 + 48 + 41 = 201

This allocation minimizes envy as much as possible given the valuations, attempting to balance the total value each agent receives.

**Final JSON Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
