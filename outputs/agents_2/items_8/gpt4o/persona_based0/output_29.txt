Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2  3   4   5   6   7
0  30  28  36  3  94  45  68  86
1  26  40  57  7  64  90  86  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[30 28 36  3 94 45 68 86]
 [26 40 57  7 64 90 86 88]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item. The goal is to allocate all items such that each agent is satisfied with their share and no agent envies the other.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [30, 28, 36, 3, 94, 45, 68, 86]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [26, 40, 57, 7, 64, 90, 86, 88]

One approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring the allocations are fair.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Items allocation for Agent 0**:
   - Items: 4, 0, 1, 3
   - Total valuation: 94 + 30 + 28 + 3 = 155

2. **Items allocation for Agent 1**:
   - Items: 5, 2, 6, 7
   - Total valuation: 90 + 57 + 86 + 88 = 321

This allocation ensures that each agent gets four items, and the allocations are based on maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 1, 3],
    "1": [5, 2, 6, 7]
}
```
