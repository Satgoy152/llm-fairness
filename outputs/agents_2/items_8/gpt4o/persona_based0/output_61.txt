Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  60  70  99  88  17  99  56
1  11  22  44  77  34  90  12   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure a division that minimizes envy, meaning each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their valuations.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 29 + 60 + 70 + 99 + 88 + 17 + 99 + 56 = 518
- Agent 1's total valuation: 11 + 22 + 44 + 77 + 34 + 90 + 12 + 2 = 292

Given these valuations, we aim to split the items such that each agent feels they are receiving a fair portion of the total value according to their perspective.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - For Agent 0, the highest values are items 3 and 6 (each valued at 99).
   - For Agent 1, the highest value is item 5 (valued at 90).

2. **Initial allocation:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 and item 5 to Agent 1 since these are high-value items for each agent.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Distribute the rest of the items to balance the total perceived value.

   **Agent 0:**
   - Assign items 0, 1, 2, and 6 (additional high value for Agent 0).
   
   **Agent 1:**
   - Assign items 4 and 7.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0 receives items**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6
- **Agent 1 receives items**: 4, 5, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items they value highly, minimizing potential envy.

### JSON Representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5, 7]
}
```
