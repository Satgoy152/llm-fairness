Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  17   1  84  22   5  64  62
1  36  76  50  62  65  88  92   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent prefers their bundle or values it equally compared to the other's. Given that we have more items than agents, we'll use valuations to guide the allocation process. We want to assign items to ensure the total value to each agent is as balanced as possible.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \( 60 + 17 + 1 + 84 + 22 + 5 + 64 + 62 = 315 \)
- Agent 1: \( 36 + 76 + 50 + 62 + 65 + 88 + 92 + 8 = 477 \)

Next, calculate the value each agent places on each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 at 36.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 17, Agent 1 at 76.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 1, Agent 1 at 50.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 at 62.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 at 65.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 at 88.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 at 92.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 at 8.

We'll aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives using these preferences:

1. Assign items based on the highest individual valuation difference, giving the item to the agent who values it more. 
2. Ensure the total value assigned to each agent is as equal as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Assign item 1 to Agent 1** (Agent 1 values at 76, Agent 0 at 17).
2. **Assign item 5 to Agent 1** (Agent 1 values at 88, Agent 0 at 5).
3. **Assign item 6 to Agent 1** (Agent 1 values at 92, Agent 0 at 64).
4. **Assign item 4 to Agent 1** (Agent 1 values at 65, Agent 0 at 22).
5. **Assign item 3 to Agent 0** (Agent 0 values at 84, Agent 1 at 62).
6. **Assign item 0 to Agent 0** (Agent 0 values at 60, Agent 1 at 36).
7. **Assign item 7 to Agent 0** (Agent 0 values at 62, Agent 1 at 8).
8. **Assign item 2 to Agent 1** (Agent 1 values at 50, Agent 0 at 1).

Thus, the allocations are:

Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 7
Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6

Now let's represent the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
