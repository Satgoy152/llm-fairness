Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  45  93  74  21  18  83  35
1  98  11  18  59  58  68  56  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the division is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. The objective is to ensure that each agent feels that they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the given valuation table for reference:

```
    Item
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  45  93  74  21  18  83  35
1  98  11  18  59  58  68  56  11
```

One common approach to achieve fairness is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, relative to the total value they place on all items. We can use a method known as the "Greedy Algorithm" to allocate items to the agents one by one, considering each agent's highest valuation for the remaining items at each step.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Agent 0's highest valuation:** Item 2 (value 93)
2. **Agent 1's highest valuation:** Item 0 (value 98)

Now remove items 0 and 2 from the list and repeat the process for the remaining items.

3. **Agent 0's highest remaining valuation:** Item 6 (value 83)
4. **Agent 1's highest remaining valuation:** Item 5 (value 68)

Remove items 6 and 5 and repeat.

5. **Agent 0's highest remaining valuation:** Item 3 (value 74)
6. **Agent 1's highest remaining valuation:** Item 4 (value 58)

Remove items 3 and 4 and repeat.

7. **Agent 0's highest remaining valuation:** Item 1 (value 45)
8. **Agent 1's highest remaining valuation:** Item 7 (value 11)

After allocating all items, we ensure both agents are fairly treated based on their valuations. Here's the final allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 3, 1],
    "1": [0, 5, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value each agent receives based on their individual valuation of the items, providing a fair division.
