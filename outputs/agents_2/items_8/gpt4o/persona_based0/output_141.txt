Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  94   0  53  11  77  37  97
1  85  46  18  16  59  97  29  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the 8 items between the two agents while considering their preferences, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that each agent believes that they received at least as much value as any other agent did with their allocation.

To achieve this, we'll calculate the total value each agent places on all items and attempt to allocate the items in a way that balances these total values as closely as possible.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: 81 + 94 + 0 + 53 + 11 + 77 + 37 + 97 = 450
   - Agent 1: 85 + 46 + 18 + 16 + 59 + 97 + 29 + 64 = 414

2. **Initial Allocation Approach:**
   - We'll start by trying to allocate items to balance the total valuation for each agent as closely as possible.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign items based on maximizing each agent's individual value while ensuring balance:
     - Agent 0 values item 7 the highest (97), so it is allocated to Agent 0.
     - Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (97), so it is allocated to Agent 1.

4. **Continue Allocating Remaining Items:**
   - Allocate remaining items to further balance the totals:
     - Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 7]
     - Agent 1: Items [5, 2, 3, 4, 6]

5. **Calculate Final Allocated Values:**
   - Agent 0: 81 (item 0) + 94 (item 1) + 97 (item 7) = 272
   - Agent 1: 97 (item 5) + 18 (item 2) + 16 (item 3) + 59 (item 4) + 29 (item 6) = 219

The allocation above ensures that both agents receive a fair share of their total valuation, with each having a close total value.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [5, 2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
