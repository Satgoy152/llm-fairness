Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  12  49  69  14  79  55  73
1   7  40  87  62  54  91  85  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations, and ideally, each agent should feel that they have received a fair portion of the total value relative to their own valuation perspective. A common approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(56 + 12 + 49 + 69 + 14 + 79 + 55 + 73 = 407\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(7 + 40 + 87 + 62 + 54 + 91 + 85 + 12 = 438\)

Next, we'll try to allocate items to balance these total valuations across both agents as fairly as possible.

One potential fair allocation can be achieved by examining the value each agent places on each item and assigning items such that the overall value received by each agent is approximately balanced.

Let's attempt an allocation based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

1. Assign items to Agent 1 (who values items 2, 5, and 6 highly):
   - Item 2: Value to Agent 1 is 87
   - Item 5: Value to Agent 1 is 91
   - Item 6: Value to Agent 1 is 85

2. Assign the remaining items to Agent 0:
   - Item 0: Value to Agent 0 is 56
   - Item 1: Value to Agent 0 is 12
   - Item 3: Value to Agent 0 is 69
   - Item 4: Value to Agent 0 is 14
   - Item 7: Value to Agent 0 is 73

Let's verify the value each agent receives:

- Agent 0's total value: \(56 + 12 + 69 + 14 + 73 = 224\)
- Agent 1's total value: \(87 + 91 + 85 = 263\)

This allocation aims to balance the distribution of items based on their valuations, and no agent should feel envious of the other's allocation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures both agents receive a fair portion based on their respective valuations, and all 8 items are allocated.
