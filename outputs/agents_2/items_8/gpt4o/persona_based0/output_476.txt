Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  12  18  28  86  19  10  65
1  85  43  93  96  47  10  75  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, let's aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. This usually involves ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of items with a total valuation that they perceive as being at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 81 + 12 + 18 + 28 + 86 + 19 + 10 + 65 = 319
- Agent 1's total valuation: 85 + 43 + 93 + 96 + 47 + 10 + 75 + 89 = 538

Now, let's try to allocate the items in a way that is as balanced as possible in terms of perceived value for each agent.

1. Start by giving each agent their highest valued items:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most (86), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (96), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

2. Next, consider each agent's second highest valued item:
   - Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 0 (81), allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 2 (93), allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. Proceed by alternating allocations based on remaining high valuations while keeping track of total values:
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 89).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 75).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 43).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 19).

Finally, allocate the remaining item based on who would benefit more:
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, who values it at 93.

Let's tally the allocations:

Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 5
- Total valuation for Agent 0: 81 + 86 + 19 = 186

Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 43 + 93 + 96 + 75 + 89 = 396

While not perfectly equal, this allocation ensures that each agent's highest priority items are respected, and it attempts to balance the valuations as much as possible given the constraint of integer allocations. It is important to note that achieving perfect envy-free allocation is often difficult with integer allocations, especially with such different total valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
