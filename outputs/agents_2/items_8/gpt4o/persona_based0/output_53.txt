Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42   7  60  72  18  47  70  94
1  54  58  36  71  43  39   4  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to it as possible, let's consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize each agent's utility while ensuring that the division is fair.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(42 + 7 + 60 + 72 + 18 + 47 + 70 + 94 = 410\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(54 + 58 + 36 + 71 + 43 + 39 + 4 + 32 = 337\)

### Step 2: Consider Preferences

Let's prioritize allocating items based on each agent's highest valuation, and try to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

### Step 3: Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 7 (94) and item 3 (72), so allocate these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 (58) and item 0 (54), so allocate these to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** next highly values item 6 (70) and item 2 (60), allocate these to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** next highly values item 4 (43), allocate this to Agent 1.
5. The remaining item, 5 (valuated as 47 by Agent 0 and 39 by Agent 1), should be allocated to Agent 0 to better balance the value distribution.

### Step 4: Final Valuations

- Agent 0: \(94 + 72 + 70 + 60 + 47 = 343\)
- Agent 1: \(58 + 54 + 43 = 155\)

### Allocation in JSON Format

Here's the allocation of items to the agents in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
