Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  83  74  38   7  47  81  62
1  95  52  55  26  77  94  72  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 83 74 38  7 47 81 62]
 [95 52 55 26 77 94 72 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent feels they have received an allocation at least as valuable as the allocation received by the other agent according to their own valuations. We also want to ensure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Here is the valuation matrix for reference:

```
Agent 0: [63, 83, 74, 38, 7, 47, 81, 62]
Agent 1: [95, 52, 55, 26, 77, 94, 72, 35]
```

To achieve a fair division, let's consider the following approach:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 1 the most. The highest-valued items for this agent are 1, 2, and 6.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 the most. The highest-valued items for this agent are 0, 5, and 4.

We will try to allocate these items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives:

- Assign items 1, 2, and 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 0, 5, and 4 to Agent 1.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items (3 and 7):

- Agent 0 values item 7 more than Agent 1, so assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3, 4, 5]

Let's check the total valuation for each agent:

- **Agent 0's Total Valuation**: 83 (item 1) + 74 (item 2) + 81 (item 6) + 62 (item 7) = 300
- **Agent 1's Total Valuation**: 95 (item 0) + 26 (item 3) + 77 (item 4) + 94 (item 5) = 292

Both agents receive similar total valuations, and each gets 4 items. This allocation is relatively envy-free given the distribution.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
