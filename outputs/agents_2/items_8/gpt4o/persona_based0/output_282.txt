Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  97   8  50  11  83   3  60
1  55  71  75  81  78  19  96   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents such that each receives an integer number of items and the allocation is as envy-free as possible, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items while ensuring that neither agent envies the other for the total value they receive.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Total Valuation Calculation**: Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items combined. This helps us understand the relative importance and valuation of items for each agent.

   - Agent 0's total valuation: \(58 + 97 + 8 + 50 + 11 + 83 + 3 + 60 = 370\)
   - Agent 1's total valuation: \(55 + 71 + 75 + 81 + 78 + 19 + 96 + 3 = 478\)

2. **Item-by-Item Comparison**: For each item, compare the valuations between the two agents and allocate the item to the agent who values it more, while trying to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

3. **Fair Allocation Strategy**:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (since 58 > 55).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (since 97 > 71).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (since 75 > 8).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (since 81 > 50).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (since 78 > 11).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (since 83 > 19).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (since 96 > 3).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (since 60 > 3).

Now, let's verify the allocations and ensure they are as envy-free as possible:

- **Agent 0's total valuation**: \(58 + 97 + 83 + 60 = 298\)
- **Agent 1's total valuation**: \(75 + 81 + 78 + 96 = 330\)

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets the items they value more highly.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items have been allocated and aims to be as fair and envy-free as possible given the valuations.
