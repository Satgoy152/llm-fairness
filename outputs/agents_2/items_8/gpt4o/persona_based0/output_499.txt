Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  84  89  71   8   6  69  67
1  62  91  96  55  95  53  72  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their valuations.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0's total value: 44 + 84 + 89 + 71 + 8 + 6 + 69 + 67 = 438
- Agent 1's total value: 62 + 91 + 96 + 55 + 95 + 53 + 72 + 69 = 593

Given these valuations, we aim to allocate items such that each agent perceives they have received at least half of their total valuation, or as close as possible, and no agent envies the other's allocation.

A potential approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the perceived value each agent has for the items they receive. The challenge here is to ensure that the allocations are envy-free and fair. 

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Select items where Agent 0 has relatively higher valuations compared to Agent 1.
   - Items: 0 (value 44), 3 (value 71), 6 (value 69), 7 (value 67)
   - Total value for Agent 0 with this allocation: 44 + 71 + 69 + 67 = 251

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign the remaining items to Agent 1, focusing on their higher valuations.
   - Items: 1 (value 91), 2 (value 96), 4 (value 95), 5 (value 53)
   - Total value for Agent 1 with this allocation: 91 + 96 + 95 + 53 = 335

Both agents receive their items in a way that maximizes their value perception, reducing envy.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets four items, maximizing their perceived value, and maintaining a balance that minimizes envy.
