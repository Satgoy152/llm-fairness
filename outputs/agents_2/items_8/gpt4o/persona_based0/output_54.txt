Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  22  28  50  11  42  76  58
1  55  92  87  81   6  41  28  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can employ an approach based on maximizing the total satisfaction of both agents. The main goal is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, while also considering the overall distribution to maintain fairness.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(10 + 22 + 28 + 50 + 11 + 42 + 76 + 58 = 297\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(55 + 92 + 87 + 81 + 6 + 41 + 28 + 77 = 467\)

The next step is to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share relative to their total valuation. One common approach in such situations is to give each agent roughly half of the total number of items, as there are two agents and eight items in total. However, the allocations should also be guided by the specific valuations to reduce envy.

Let's allocate items by considering both the value each agent places on each item and the need to balance the total value they receive:

1. **Allocate items to Agent 1** (who has higher valuations overall):
   - Item 1: Value for Agent 1 = 92
   - Item 3: Value for Agent 1 = 81
   - Item 2: Value for Agent 1 = 87
   - Item 7: Value for Agent 1 = 77

2. **Allocate remaining items to Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value for Agent 0 = 10
   - Item 4: Value for Agent 0 = 11
   - Item 5: Value for Agent 0 = 42
   - Item 6: Value for Agent 0 = 76

This allocation allows each agent to receive items they value highly:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 4, 5, 6] with a total value of \(10 + 11 + 42 + 76 = 139\).
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 2, 3, 7] with a total value of \(92 + 87 + 81 + 77 = 337\).

Both agents receive four items, and the distribution considers their valuations, reducing potential envy.

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7]
}
```
