Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  26  76  21   7   9  37  14
1  43   8  21  25  50  68  41  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can follow a method that tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives. We'll use each agent's valuations to distribute the items such that both agents feel they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

First, let us calculate the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(71 + 26 + 76 + 21 + 7 + 9 + 37 + 14 = 261\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(43 + 8 + 21 + 25 + 50 + 68 + 41 + 25 = 281\)

Now, we aim to distribute the items to balance the values received by each agent as much as possible. Here's one approach:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent, one by one, ensuring that the overall valuation is balanced.

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 76 for item 2.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 68 for item 5.

2. Continue assigning remaining items to balance the total value each agent gets:

- Agent 0: Items 0 (71), 2 (76), 6 (37)
- Agent 1: Items 5 (68), 4 (50), 3 (25)

3. Assign the remaining items to balance the valuation further:

- Agent 0: Add item 1 (26)
- Agent 1: Add item 7 (25)

This allocation aims to balance each agent's perceived total value. Let's verify the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(71 + 76 + 37 + 26 = 210\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(68 + 50 + 25 + 25 = 168\)

Now, let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6, 1],
    "1": [5, 4, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving a fair share according to their own valuations.
