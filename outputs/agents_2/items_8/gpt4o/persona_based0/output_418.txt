Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  91  75  73  77  19  75  76
1  46  55   3  54  87  75  50  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy between the two agents, we'll aim for an allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Total Valuation Check**: 
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 40 + 91 + 75 + 73 + 77 + 19 + 75 + 76 = 526
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 46 + 55 + 3 + 54 + 87 + 75 + 50 + 95 = 365

2. **Fair Share**: 
   - Since there are 8 items, ideally, each agent should receive 4 items. However, we need to ensure that each agent gets a total value that they consider fair.

3. **Greedy Allocation**:
   - Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent based on their individual valuations.

4. **Allocation Process**:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (91), so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 the highest (95), so allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
   - Continue this process, ensuring each agent gets 4 items.

5. **Final Allocation**: 
   - Adjust if necessary to ensure each agent receives exactly 4 items in total.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 2, 3, 5
  - Valuations for Agent 0: 91 + 75 + 73 + 19 = 258

- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 4, 6, 7
  - Valuations for Agent 1: 46 + 87 + 50 + 95 = 278

With this allocation, each agent gets 4 items, and the distribution minimizes envy based on their valuations.

{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
