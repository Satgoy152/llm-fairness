Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  23  17  70  24  85  18   6
1  58  97  37  77  65  28  47  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations and attempt to distribute the items in a manner that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness in this context means no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent based on their own valuations. We aim to balance the total value each agent receives according to their valuations of the items.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(3 + 23 + 17 + 70 + 24 + 85 + 18 + 6 = 246\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(58 + 97 + 37 + 77 + 65 + 28 + 47 + 48 = 457\)

Next, we will try to allocate items such that the total value received by each agent is as balanced as possible given their respective valuations.

### Potential Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items with higher relative value for Agent 0: 5 (85), 3 (70), 4 (24), 2 (17)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items with higher relative value for Agent 1: 1 (97), 0 (58), 6 (47), 7 (48)

#### Allocation:
- **Agent 0** receives items: 2, 3, 4, 5
  - Total value for Agent 0: \(17 + 70 + 24 + 85 = 196\)

- **Agent 1** receives items: 0, 1, 6, 7
  - Total value for Agent 1: \(58 + 97 + 47 + 48 = 250\)

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free, but it aims to balance the allocation based on the agents' valuations as closely as possible. It ensures that each agent receives a significant portion of their highest-valued items while also ensuring that all items are allocated.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 6, 7]
}
```
