Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  41  47   1  28  67  77  82
1  27  70  10  83  94  58  60   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of each item. The goal is to distribute the items so that no agent envies another based on their individual valuations.

First, let's evaluate the total value that each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 58 + 41 + 47 + 1 + 28 + 67 + 77 + 82 = 401
- Agent 1's total valuation: 27 + 70 + 10 + 83 + 94 + 58 + 60 + 3 = 405

Given these valuations, here is a step-by-step allocation aiming for envy-freeness:

1. **Agent 1's Highest Valued Items:**
   - Item 4: Valuation is 94.
   - Item 3: Valuation is 83.
   - Item 1: Valuation is 70.

2. **Agent 0's Highest Valued Items:**
   - Item 7: Valuation is 82.
   - Item 6: Valuation is 77.
   - Item 5: Valuation is 67.

3. **Remaining Items (2, 0):**
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (Valuation 47 vs. Agent 1's valuation of 10).
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (Valuation 58 vs. Agent 1's valuation of 27).

After these allocations, we have:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 58 + 47 + 67 + 77 + 82 = 331
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 4
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 70 + 83 + 94 = 247

This allocation minimizes envy since each agent receives items they highly value based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
