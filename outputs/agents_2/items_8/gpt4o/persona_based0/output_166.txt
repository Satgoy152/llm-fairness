Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  26  86  94  83  26  85  85
1  53  59  27  87  15  97   8  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 8 items between the 2 agents such that the allocation is fair and envy-free, if possible. Envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

To achieve this, we can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Item per Agent**: This will help us understand the preferences of each agent for the items.
   
2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Value**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's start with step-by-step allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 92, and Agent 1 values it at 53. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 26, and Agent 1 values it at 59. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 86, and Agent 1 values it at 27. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 94, and Agent 1 values it at 87. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 83, and Agent 1 values it at 15. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 26, and Agent 1 values it at 97. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 85, and Agent 1 values it at 8. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 85, and Agent 1 values it at 46. Allocate to Agent 0.

After this allocation, Agent 0 has items [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7], and Agent 1 has items [1, 5]. This allocation might not be envy-free since Agent 1 has significantly fewer items. 

To balance the allocation, let's re-evaluate and try to achieve a more balanced distribution:

- Reassign Item 3 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 could value it more than having fewer items overall.

Now, the allocation is:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 2, 4, 6, 7]
- **Agent 1**: [1, 3, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent has a bundle that they value, and the distribution is more balanced. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
