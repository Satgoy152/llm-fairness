Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4  5   6  7
0  12  98  40  97  54  7  59  5
1  42   5  43  49   5  9  56  7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we should consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as the other's.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 12 + 98 + 40 + 97 + 54 + 7 + 59 + 5 = 372
- Agent 1's total valuation: 42 + 5 + 43 + 49 + 5 + 9 + 56 + 7 = 216

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items to achieve a fair division:

1. **Item 1** (Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 at 5): Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 3** (Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 at 49): Assign to Agent 0.
3. **Item 6** (Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 at 56): Assign to Agent 1, as the difference is minimal and Agent 1 values it highly.
4. **Item 2** (Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 at 43): Assign to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it slightly more.
5. **Item 0** (Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 at 42): Assign to Agent 1.
6. **Item 4** (Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 at 5): Assign to Agent 0.
7. **Item 5** (Agent 0 values it at 7, Agent 1 at 9): Assign to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7** (Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 at 7): Assign to Agent 1.

Let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0's items**: [1, 3, 4] with a total valuation of 98 + 97 + 54 = 249
- **Agent 1's items**: [0, 2, 5, 6, 7] with a total valuation of 42 + 43 + 9 + 56 + 7 = 157

These allocations ensure that both agents get items they value highly, and the sum of items allocated is exactly 8.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
