Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  86  97  75  47  85  41  13
1  43  93  36  93  48  65  75  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuation.

Let's examine the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 17 + 86 + 97 + 75 + 47 + 85 + 41 + 13 = 461
- Agent 1's total valuation: 43 + 93 + 36 + 93 + 48 + 65 + 75 + 97 = 550

Now, we will allocate items to each agent, aiming for each agent to value their allocation as close as possible to half of their total valuation, which is:

- Agent 0: 461 / 2 = 230.5
- Agent 1: 550 / 2 = 275

Let's allocate the items to balance the valuations as evenly as possible:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 97).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 93).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 93).
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 85).
5. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 97).
6. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 17).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 75).
8. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 47).

Calculating the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 97 (item 2) + 85 (item 5) + 17 (item 0) + 47 (item 4) = 246
- Agent 1: 93 (item 1) + 93 (item 3) + 97 (item 7) + 75 (item 6) = 358

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 7, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items so that each agent's total valuation is as close to half of their total valuation as possible.
