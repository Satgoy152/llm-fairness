Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  80  49  41  51  31  52   3
1  44  56  17  74  19  94  14  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while aiming to minimize envy, we should consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

### Step 1: Analyze the valuations

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 83
- Item 1: 80
- Item 2: 49
- Item 3: 41
- Item 4: 51
- Item 5: 31
- Item 6: 52
- Item 7: 3

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 44
- Item 1: 56
- Item 2: 17
- Item 3: 74
- Item 4: 19
- Item 5: 94
- Item 6: 14
- Item 7: 77

### Step 2: Allocate items with a focus on maximizing each agent's perceived value

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with the highest valuations.
   - Highest valued items: 0 (83), 1 (80), 6 (52), 4 (51)

2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with the highest valuations.
   - Highest valued items: 5 (94), 3 (74), 7 (77)

### Step 3: Final allocation

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1, 4, 6]
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 3, 5, 7]

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a total of 4 items each, and the distribution aims to maximize each agent's individual utility based on their highest valuations.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.
