Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  40  37  11  20   9  79   4
1  22  91  80  21  34  87  39  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value anyone else's allocation. Given the valuations provided, we aim for each agent to feel they have received a fair share based on their own valuation.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total value: \(60 + 40 + 37 + 11 + 20 + 9 + 79 + 4 = 260\)
- Agent 1's total value: \(22 + 91 + 80 + 21 + 34 + 87 + 39 + 65 = 439\)

Next, we will try to allocate the items such that each agent feels they are getting a value close to their fair share based on their total valuation. The goal is to minimize envy.

A potential allocation is as follows:

1. Allocate items to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 60. 
   - Agent 0 values item 6 next at 79.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 37.
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 20.

   Total value for Agent 0: \(60 + 79 + 37 + 20 = 196\)

2. Allocate items to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 91.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 next at 87.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 21.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 at 65.

   Total value for Agent 1: \(91 + 87 + 21 + 65 = 264\)

Both agents have allocations that they value highly, and importantly, no agent envies the other's allocation considering they value their own allocation higher than the other's. This is a simple approach to achieve an envy-free allocation given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
