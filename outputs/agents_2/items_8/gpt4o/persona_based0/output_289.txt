Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  17  42  40  10  20  22  66
1  24  77  10  30  17  53  91  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items between the two agents while ensuring that the allocation is fair and envy-free, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation while adhering to the fair division principles.

Here are the steps we'll take:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Determine the total value each agent assigns to all items combined. This helps in understanding how each agent values the entire pool of items.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Attempt to allocate items based on highest valuations of individual items first, ensuring each agent gets items they value highly.

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness**: After the initial allocation, check if any agent envies the other's allocation. Adjust if necessary to ensure envy-freeness.

4. **Final Adjustments**: Ensure that all items are allocated, and no item is left unallocated.

Let's perform these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 16 + 17 + 42 + 40 + 10 + 20 + 22 + 66 = 233
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 24 + 77 + 10 + 30 + 17 + 53 + 91 + 53 = 355

2. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 highly values items: 7 (66), 2 (42), 3 (40)
   - Agent 1 highly values items: 1 (77), 6 (91), 5 (53)

3. **Allocate These Items**:
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items left: 0, 3, 4, 5

5. **Allocate Remaining Items Based on Fairness and Envy-Freeness**:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (valued 24 by Agent 1)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (valued 40 by Agent 0)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (valued 17 by Agent 1)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (valued 20 by Agent 0)

6. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [2, 3, 5, 7]
   - Agent 1: [0, 1, 4, 6]

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value highly, while the total allocation is balanced.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 6]
}
```
