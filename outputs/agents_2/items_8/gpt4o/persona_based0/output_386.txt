Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  28  49  74  94  15  23  30
1  46  70  92  57  54  16  79  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while striving for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. Envy-freeness means that each agent should prefer their own allocation to that of the other agent, or at least be equally satisfied.

Let's summarize the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [61, 28, 49, 74, 94, 15, 23, 30]
- Agent 1: [46, 70, 92, 57, 54, 16, 79, 35]

To allocate these items fairly, we can aim to equalize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate the total value for all items:
   - Total value for Agent 0: 61 + 28 + 49 + 74 + 94 + 15 + 23 + 30 = 374
   - Total value for Agent 1: 46 + 70 + 92 + 57 + 54 + 16 + 79 + 35 = 449

2. We aim to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation is as close as possible to half of the sum of these total values.

3. Sort the items based on differences in valuations between the agents to identify items with the largest difference in preferences. This helps to make decisions that minimize envy.

4. Allocate items iteratively, ensuring that each allocation does not cause significant envy.

Following this approach, here's a fair allocation:

- Allocate items based on preference differences:
  - Item 4 is highly valued by Agent 0, so assign it to Agent 0.
  - Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 1, so assign it to Agent 1.
  - Item 6 is highly valued by Agent 1, so assign it to Agent 1.
  - Item 0 is valued more by Agent 0, so assign it to Agent 0.
  - Item 3 is valued more by Agent 0, so assign it to Agent 0.
  - Item 1 is valued more by Agent 1, so assign it to Agent 1.
  - Item 7 is equally valued by both, assign it to Agent 1.
  - Item 5, a low-valued item, can go to Agent 0 to balance numbers.

This leads us to the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations and minimize envy between the agents.
