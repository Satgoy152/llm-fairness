Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87   8  92  62  94  66  41  76
1  33  20  67  48  46  91  96  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. In this context, envy-freeness means that each agent values their own bundle of items at least as much as they value the bundle of items allocated to the other agent.

Let's assess the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value:  
  `87 + 8 + 92 + 62 + 94 + 66 + 41 + 76 = 526`

- Agent 1's total value:  
  `33 + 20 + 67 + 48 + 46 + 91 + 96 + 97 = 498`

Now, we will allocate the items in a way that attempts to balance the value each agent receives.

### Allocation Plan

Let's try to allocate items so that both agents get as close as possible to half of their total valuation of all items. Since Agent 0 values the items more highly, they will likely receive fewer items to balance the overall perceived value.

#### Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Their preferred items are 4, 2, 0, 5 (based on descending order of value).
- **Agent 1:** Their preferred items are 7, 6, 5, 2 (based on descending order of value).

#### Actual Distribution:

1. Assign high-value items to each agent to balance total value:
   - Agent 0 gets items: 4, 2, 0
   - Agent 1 gets items: 7, 6, 5, 1, 3

Let's check the total value for each agent in the proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0's allocation values:**  
  - Items 4, 2, 0: `94 + 92 + 87 = 273`

- **Agent 1's allocation values:**  
  - Items 7, 6, 5, 1, 3: `97 + 96 + 91 + 20 + 48 = 352`

This allocation gives Agent 0 a value of 273 and Agent 1 a value of 352, which is fairly balanced given that Agent 0's total valuation is higher. 

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 0],
    "1": [7, 6, 5, 1, 3]
}
```
