Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  50  56   0  67  46   0  61
1   7  38   0  31  99  11  89  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim for an envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible allocation. Let's start by considering the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0's total valuation:**
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 50
  - Item 2: 56
  - Item 3: 0
  - Item 4: 67
  - Item 5: 46
  - Item 6: 0
  - Item 7: 61
  - **Total: 379**

- **Agent 1's total valuation:**
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 38
  - Item 2: 0
  - Item 3: 31
  - Item 4: 99
  - Item 5: 11
  - Item 6: 89
  - Item 7: 77
  - **Total: 352**

To achieve fairness, we should try to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is approximately equal.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Assign high-value items based on preference:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (99), and Agent 1 highly values item 4 (99). Assign these items to the respective agents.
   
2. **Assign remaining items to balance total valuations:**
   - After assigning item 0 to Agent 0 and item 4 to Agent 1, the remaining items should be distributed to balance the valuations as closely as possible.

3. **Consider remaining high-value items for each agent:**
   - For Agent 0, the next highest values are item 4 (67), item 1 (50), and item 2 (56).
   - For Agent 1, the next highest values are item 6 (89), item 7 (77), and item 3 (31).

### Allocation Decision:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 and item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 and item 7 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations each agent receives, considering their preferences, and ensures all items are allocated.
