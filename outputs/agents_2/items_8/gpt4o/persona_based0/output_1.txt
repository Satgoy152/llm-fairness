Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  56  44  76  97  47  69  76
1  80  17  33  82  67  14  53  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents with the goal of minimizing envy and ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that neither agent feels significantly disadvantaged.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 43 + 56 + 44 + 76 + 97 + 47 + 69 + 76 = 508
- Agent 1's total valuation: 80 + 17 + 33 + 82 + 67 + 14 + 53 + 47 = 393

Given these valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is balanced and neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's attempt a reasonably fair allocation:

1. Assign items with the highest relative value for each agent.
2. Ensure that the number of items is balanced between the two agents.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0** has higher valuations for items 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** has higher valuations for items 3 and a comparable valuation for item 4.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: [0, 1, 4, 5]
  - Item 0: 43
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 4: 97
  - Item 5: 47
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 243

- **Agent 1**: [2, 3, 6, 7]
  - Item 2: 33
  - Item 3: 82
  - Item 6: 53
  - Item 7: 47
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 215

This allocation ensures both agents receive four items each. The total valuations for each agent are reasonably balanced considering the total valuations of all items, minimizing envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of items based on their respective valuations, minimizing potential envy between the two.
