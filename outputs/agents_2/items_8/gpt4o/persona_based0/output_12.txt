Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  39  47  54  15   0  71  44
1  78  38   0  45  25  75   7  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [78 38  0 45 25 75  7 71]]
Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly, we should aim for envy-freeness, where each agent feels they have received at least as much value as the other agent from their perspective. We will consider each agent's valuation of each item and attempt to create a fair division.

First, let's summarize the total valuations for both agents:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 34 + 39 + 47 + 54 + 15 + 0 + 71 + 44 = 304
- Agent 1's total valuation: 78 + 38 + 0 + 45 + 25 + 75 + 7 + 71 = 339

Our goal is to divide the items such that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **High-Value Items for Each Agent:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 6 (71) highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 (78) highly.

2. **Next Priority Items:**
   - Agent 0 also values items 3 (54) and 2 (47) significantly.
   - Agent 1 values items 5 (75) and 7 (71) significantly.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 7 (44) moderately, while Agent 1 values it highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 (38) moderately, which is similar for Agent 0.

### Allocation Plan

We aim to balance the allocations such that the total value perceived by each agent is as close as possible.

- **Agent 0:** Allocate items [2, 3, 4, 6]
  - Total valuation: 47 (item 2) + 54 (item 3) + 15 (item 4) + 71 (item 6) = 187

- **Agent 1:** Allocate items [0, 1, 5, 7]
  - Total valuation: 78 (item 0) + 38 (item 1) + 75 (item 5) + 71 (item 7) = 262

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and the division is as fair as possible based on their respective valuations.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 7]
}
