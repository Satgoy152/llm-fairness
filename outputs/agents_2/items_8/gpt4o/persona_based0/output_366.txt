Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4  5   6   7
0  23  62  47  37  30  4   0  83
1  31  87  12  48  51  2  77  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent. 

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent places on all the items:

For Agent 0:
- Total value = 23 + 62 + 47 + 37 + 30 + 4 + 0 + 83 = 286

For Agent 1:
- Total value = 31 + 87 + 12 + 48 + 51 + 2 + 77 + 11 = 319

Next, we determine an allocation that aims to make each agent's perceived value as equal as possible.

One possible approach is to start with the items most valued by each agent and then fill in the gaps with remaining items to balance the total perceived value:

**Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 1, 2, 3, 5  
  - Total value: 62 + 47 + 37 + 4 = 150

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 0, 4, 6, 7
  - Total value: 31 + 51 + 77 + 11 = 170

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of allocated items is 8. It also aims to reduce envy by balancing the perceived total values as much as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
