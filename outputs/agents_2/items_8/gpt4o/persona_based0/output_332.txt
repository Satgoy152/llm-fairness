Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  14  38  44  14   1  71  96
1   8  53  63  53  43  71  11  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 53 63 53 43 71 11 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can follow a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's valuation based on their preferences, while keeping the total valuations as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [26, 14, 38, 44, 14, 1, 71, 96]
- Agent 1's valuations: [8, 53, 63, 53, 43, 71, 11, 44]

The total value each agent assigns to all items is calculated as follows:

- Total value for Agent 0: 26 + 14 + 38 + 44 + 14 + 1 + 71 + 96 = 304
- Total value for Agent 1: 8 + 53 + 63 + 53 + 43 + 71 + 11 + 44 = 346

To achieve fairness, we aim to distribute the items so that both agents feel that they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. 

We'll start by assigning each agent the item they value the most:

- The most valued item by Agent 0 is item 7 (value 96).
- The most valued item by Agent 1 is item 5 (value 71).

Next, we continue allocating items by considering each agent's next highest-valued item, ensuring the allocation remains as balanced as possible:

1. Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

Continue allocation:

3. The next highest value for Agent 0 is item 6 (value 71).
4. The next highest value for Agent 1 is item 2 (value 63).

5. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

Continue allocation:

7. The next highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 (value 44).
8. The next highest value for Agent 1 is item 3 (value 53) but it's already allocated, so we consider item 1 (value 53).

9. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
10. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

Continue allocation:

11. The next highest value for Agent 0 is item 2 (value 38) but it's already allocated, so we consider item 0 (value 26).
12. The next highest value for Agent 1 is item 4 (value 43).

13. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
14. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

Finally, allocate the remaining items:

15. Agent 0: item 4 (value 14) is already allocated, consider item 1 (value 14).
16. Agent 1: item 6 (value 11) is already allocated, consider item 0 (value 8).

17. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
18. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

Review the allocations, ensuring no items are duplicated and each agent has a fair share:

Agent 0: [7, 6, 3, 0, 1]
Agent 1: [5, 2, 4]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6, 3, 0, 1],
    "1": [5, 2, 4]
}
```
