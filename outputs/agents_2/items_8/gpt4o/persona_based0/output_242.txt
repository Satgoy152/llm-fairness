Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  88  18  23  85  14  68  86
1  13  13  73  86  39  87  29  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 13 73 86 39 87 29 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that both agents receive a set of items that maximizes their individual satisfaction and minimizes envy. Envy-freeness implies that each agent should prefer their own allocation over the allocation of the other agent.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [60, 88, 18, 23, 85, 14, 68, 86]
- Agent 1's valuations: [13, 13, 73, 86, 39, 87, 29, 62]

A straightforward approach is to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible. We can follow an iterative approach to assign items one by one based on the remaining highest value difference by each agent for items not yet allocated.

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most (88), and **Agent 1** values item 5 the most (87). We assign item 1 to Agent 0 and item 5 to Agent 1.

2. Next, Agent 0 values item 4 the most (85) after item 1, while Agent 1 values item 3 the most (86). We assign item 4 to Agent 0 and item 3 to Agent 1.

3. After the top valued items, the next highest for Agent 0 is item 7 (86) and for Agent 1 is item 2 (73). We assign item 7 to Agent 0 and item 2 to Agent 1.

4. The remaining items are 0, 6, and 7. Agent 0 values item 6 (68), and Agent 1 values item 0 (13) next. We assign item 6 to Agent 0 and item 0 to Agent 1.

Let's summarize the allocations:

- **Agent 0** receives items: 1, 4, 7, 6
- **Agent 1** receives items: 5, 3, 2, 0

Now, let's format the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7, 6],
    "1": [5, 3, 2, 0]
}
```
