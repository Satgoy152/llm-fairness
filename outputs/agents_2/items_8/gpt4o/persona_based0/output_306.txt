Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  32  42  78  59  35  42  55
1   2  26  72   5  11  44  19  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1) so that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is envy-free as much as possible, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their bundle as at least as valuable as the other's, minimizing potential envy.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0's valuations:** [10, 32, 42, 78, 59, 35, 42, 55]
- **Agent 1's valuations:** [2, 26, 72, 5, 11, 44, 19, 46]

To find a fair allocation, we'll try to maximize each agent's total value from their allocated items. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - For Agent 0: Items 3 (value 78), 4 (value 59), and 7 (value 55) are high-value items.
   - For Agent 1: Items 2 (value 72), 5 (value 44), and 7 (value 46) are high-value items.

2. **Begin allocation by assigning high-value items:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).

3. **Allocate remaining items to balance total value:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 1.

This allocation balances the total value perceived by each agent from their respective bundles. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 3, and 4 with a total valuation of 10 + 32 + 78 + 59 = 179.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 5, 6, and 7 with a total valuation of 72 + 44 + 19 + 46 = 181.

This allocation aims to minimize envy by giving each agent a bundle of items close to their highest perceived value while ensuring all items are allocated.
