Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  61  49  28  38  65  78  62
1  43  37  22   5  79  18  53  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to assess the valuations that each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that neither agent envies the other's allocation, if possible. 

Let's review the valuations:

**Agent 0's Valuations:**
- Item 0: 99
- Item 1: 61
- Item 2: 49
- Item 3: 28
- Item 4: 38
- Item 5: 65
- Item 6: 78
- Item 7: 62

**Agent 1's Valuations:**
- Item 0: 43
- Item 1: 37
- Item 2: 22
- Item 3: 5
- Item 4: 79
- Item 5: 18
- Item 6: 53
- Item 7: 69

### Steps to Allocate Items

1. **Identify Highly Valued Items**: 
   - For Agent 0, highly valued items include items 0, 6, and 5.
   - For Agent 1, highly valued items include items 4, 7, and 6.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (valued at 99).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (valued at 79).

3. **Next Highest Valuations**:
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (valued at 78).
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (valued at 69).

4. **Balancing Remaining Items**:
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (valued at 65).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (valued at 37).

5. **Assign Remaining Items**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (valued at 49).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (valued at 5).

### Allocation Result

Following the above steps, we ensure that both agents receive items that maximize their valuation while trying to minimize envy. 

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 5, 2],
    "1": [4, 7, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations, potentially minimizing the envy between them.
