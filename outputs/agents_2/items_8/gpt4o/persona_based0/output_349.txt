Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  25  48  89  92  89  74  35
1  21  53  17  31  85  19  22  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, meaning that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 1: 25
  - Item 2: 48
  - Item 3: 89
  - Item 4: 92
  - Item 5: 89
  - Item 6: 74
  - Item 7: 35

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 21
  - Item 1: 53
  - Item 2: 17
  - Item 3: 31
  - Item 4: 85
  - Item 5: 19
  - Item 6: 22
  - Item 7: 80

We want to minimize envy, so we can start by giving each agent the items they value the most, provided it doesn't cause significant envy in the other agent. A good strategy is to give each agent the items with the highest difference in their favor.

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0 (97) and item 4 (92), which are much higher than Agent 1's valuation for the same items. So these should be allocated to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 (80) much higher than Agent 0, so it should be allocated to Agent 1.
3. For the remaining items, we can allocate them to balance the total valuation for each agent.

After analyzing the valuations, here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Allocate items 0, 2, 3, and 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate items 1, 5, 6, and 7 to Agent 1.

Let's verify:

- Agent 0 will get items with valuations: 97, 48, 89, 92
- Agent 1 will get items with valuations: 53, 19, 22, 80

Both agents receive 4 items each, and this allocation minimizes envy based on their individual valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items in a manner that considers both agents' preferences, aiming to achieve fairness and minimize envy.
