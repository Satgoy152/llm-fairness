Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  18  86  47  59  72  71  23
1   5  98  54  50  96  48  81   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free, meaning each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation given to the other agent. 

Let's first compute the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value for all items:  
  \(29 + 18 + 86 + 47 + 59 + 72 + 71 + 23 = 405\)

- Agent 1's total value for all items:  
  \(5 + 98 + 54 + 50 + 96 + 48 + 81 + 8 = 340\)

We aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received at least half of the total value of items from their perspective.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items**:
   - Item 2: 86
   - Item 5: 72
   - Item 6: 71
   - Item 4: 59

2. **Agent 1's highest valued items**:
   - Item 1: 98
   - Item 4: 96
   - Item 6: 81
   - Item 3: 50

### Allocation:

- **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
- **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
- **Item 5**: Assign to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0)
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1)
- **Item 6**: Assign to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0)
- **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1)
- **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has more preference for it compared to Agent 1)
- **Item 7**: Assign to Agent 1 (to balance the number of items)

### Values after allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [2, 5, 6, 0]  
  Total value for Agent 0 = 86 + 72 + 71 + 29 = 258

- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 4, 3, 7]  
  Total value for Agent 1 = 98 + 96 + 50 + 8 = 252

Both agents receive allocations they value highly, and the number of items is balanced. Neither agent envies the other's allocation given the values they assign.

### Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6, 0],
    "1": [1, 4, 3, 7]
}
```
