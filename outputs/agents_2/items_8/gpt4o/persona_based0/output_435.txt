Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  19  96  86  15  99  22  44
1  81  41  10   6  80  37  66  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 8 items between the two agents in a way that is fair and envy-free. A common approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives and ensure that each agent does not envy the other's allocation.

Let's examine the total value each item has for each agent:

- Agent 0: [69, 19, 96, 86, 15, 99, 22, 44]
- Agent 1: [81, 41, 10, 6, 80, 37, 66, 61]

Next, we will try to maximize the total value each agent gets while ensuring fairness, ideally resulting in envy-free allocation.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Assign items 0, 2, 5, and 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 3, 4, and 6 to Agent 1.

Valuations for this allocation:

- Agent 0's total value: 69 + 96 + 99 + 44 = 308
- Agent 1's total value: 41 + 6 + 80 + 66 = 193

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives a high total value, while Agent 1 gets the items that provide them a relatively higher value based on their preferences. This allocation attempts to make each agent satisfied with their share, given the constraints.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
