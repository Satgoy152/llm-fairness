Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  78  34  77  24   9  52  65
1  45  96  65  50  99  42  82  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[68 78 34 77 24  9 52 65]
 [45 96 65 50 99 42 82 50]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent prefers their own allocation over the other agent's allocation, based on their valuations.

Given the valuation matrix:

| Items | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Agent 0| 68 | 78 | 34 | 77 | 24 | 9  | 52 | 65 |
| Agent 1| 45 | 96 | 65 | 50 | 99 | 42 | 82 | 50 |

We need to allocate 4 items to each agent in such a way that no agent envies the other. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 highly (78), item 3 (77), item 0 (68), and item 7 (65).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 highly (99), item 1 (96), item 6 (82), and item 2 (65).

With this information, let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 as it is highly valued by both but more by Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

The allocations will therefore be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 5, 7
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 4, 6

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
