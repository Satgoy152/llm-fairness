Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  61   1  67  28  87  94  18
1  11  20  16  40   5  40  25  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents in a fair manner, we should aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should feel that their bundle of items is at least as valuable as the other's bundle, based on their individual valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation for all items: 6 + 61 + 1 + 67 + 28 + 87 + 94 + 18 = 362
- Agent 1's total valuation for all items: 11 + 20 + 16 + 40 + 5 + 40 + 25 + 72 = 229

One potential approach is to allocate items such that both agents receive approximately half of their total value from the set of items, minimizing envy.

Let's attempt the allocation:

1. Start by giving each agent the item with the highest value according to their preference.

   - Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 94.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 the highest at 72.

2. Continue allocating items to balance the total value received by each agent:

   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value 87 for Agent 0, 40 for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 67 for Agent 0, 40 for Agent 1).

3. Further allocate to balance the remaining items:

   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 61 for Agent 0, 20 for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 6 for Agent 0, 11 for Agent 1).

4. Allocate the remaining items:

   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 1 for Agent 0, 16 for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (value 28 for Agent 0, 5 for Agent 1).

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 6, 5, 1, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 7, 3, 0, 2

Verification of total values:

- Agent 0's total value: 94 (item 6) + 87 (item 5) + 61 (item 1) + 28 (item 4) = 270
- Agent 1's total value: 72 (item 7) + 40 (item 3) + 11 (item 0) + 16 (item 2) = 139

Both agents have been allocated 4 items, and each item has been assigned to one of the agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 1, 4],
    "1": [7, 3, 0, 2]
}
```
