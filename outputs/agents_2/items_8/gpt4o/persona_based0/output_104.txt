Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  12  50  15  48  65  96  98
1   2  34  93  75  94  66  16  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels that they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness with indivisible items is often not possible, so we aim for a fair distribution that minimizes envy as much as possible.

Let's start by examining the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(31 + 12 + 50 + 15 + 48 + 65 + 96 + 98 = 415\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(2 + 34 + 93 + 75 + 94 + 66 + 16 + 89 = 469\)

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent's share is as close to half of their total valuation as possible, while also ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of high-value items.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High-value items for Agent 0: 6 (96), 7 (98), 5 (65)
   - Allocate items: 6, 7, 5
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: \(96 + 98 + 65 = 259\)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High-value items for Agent 1: 2 (93), 4 (94), 3 (75)
   - Allocate items: 2, 4, 3
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: \(93 + 94 + 75 = 262\)

Now, allocate the remaining items:

3. **Remaining items**: 0, 1

- Agent 0 values item 0 as 31, and item 1 as 12.
- Agent 1 values item 0 as 2, and item 1 as 34.

Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 and item 1 to Agent 1:

- **Agent 0**: Add item 0 (valued at 31 for Agent 0)
- **Agent 1**: Add item 1 (valued at 34 for Agent 1)

### Final Allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [6, 7, 5, 0], Total valuation = \(96 + 98 + 65 + 31 = 290\)
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 4, 3, 1], Total valuation = \(93 + 94 + 75 + 34 = 296\)

This allocation tries to balance the valuation totals and ensures each agent gets a fair share of items they value highly.

### Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 5, 0],
    "1": [2, 4, 3, 1]
}
```
