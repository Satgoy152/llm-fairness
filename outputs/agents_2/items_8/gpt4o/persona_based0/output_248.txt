Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  12  31  98  90  70  25  45
1  68  95  86   9  74  37  97  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for the items. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items given to another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [52, 12, 31, 98, 90, 70, 25, 45]
- Agent 1: [68, 95, 86, 9, 74, 37, 97, 95]

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we'll try to distribute the items such that both agents are satisfied with their own allocations. One approach to achieve this is to start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent and attempt to balance the total value of items each agent receives.

#### Allocation Strategy:
1. Identify the items with the highest valuations for each agent.
2. Allocate items that maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring the total number of items allocated is 8.
3. Adjust the allocation to ensure no envy, meaning that each agent's total value from their allocation is as balanced as possible.

#### Steps:
- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items: 3 (98), 4 (90), 5 (70)
- **Agent 1** has high valuations for items: 1 (95), 2 (86), 6 (97), 7 (95)

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 98).
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 90).
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 70).

This gives Agent 0 a total value of 258 from items 3, 4, and 5.

4. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 95).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 86).
6. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 97).
7. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 95).

This gives Agent 1 a total value of 373 from items 1, 2, 6, and 7.

Now, we have one remaining item to allocate, item 0.

- Item 0 has a value of 52 for Agent 0 and 68 for Agent 1. Assigning it to Agent 1 would increase Agent 1's total value further and might create envy from Agent 0. To balance the allocation slightly, assign item 0 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 6, 7

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and while Agent 1 has a higher total valuation, both agents receive their high-valued preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 6, 7]
}
```
