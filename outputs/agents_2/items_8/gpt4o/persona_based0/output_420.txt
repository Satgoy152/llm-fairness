Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  51  76   8  81  13  40  98
1  53  26  33  91  53  13  18  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 26 33 91 53 13 18 26]]
Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation between the two agents, we can use the method of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that the items are fairly distributed. 

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were given all the items:

- For Agent 0: 91 + 51 + 76 + 8 + 81 + 13 + 40 + 98 = 458
- For Agent 1: 53 + 26 + 33 + 91 + 53 + 13 + 18 + 26 = 313

Given these valuations, we can aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent's share closely matches their total value proportions. Hereâ€™s one way to achieve this:

1. Assign items to each agent by their highest value preference until all items are distributed.
2. Ensure that both agents' total valuations are as balanced as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 7, so allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3, so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Continue this process by comparing the remaining highest valuations for each unallocated item.

Following this approach, the allocations can be:

1. Assign items based on highest value preference:
   - Item 0 to Agent 0 (since 91 > 53)
   - Item 1 to Agent 0 (since 51 > 26)
   - Item 2 to Agent 0 (since 76 > 33)
   - Item 3 to Agent 1 (since 91 > 8)
   - Item 4 to Agent 0 (since 81 > 53)
   - Item 5 to Agent 1 (since 13 = 13, but Agent 1 needs more value)
   - Item 6 to Agent 0 (since 40 > 18)
   - Item 7 to Agent 0 (since 98 > 26)

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 5]

This allocation ensures that items are distributed with consideration of each agent's value preferences and attempts to make the distribution as fair as possible under the circumstances.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 5]
}
```
