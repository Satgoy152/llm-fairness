Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  89  11  93  92  48  20  36
1  28   9   8  56  95  15  38  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free distribution, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 53 + 89 + 11 + 93 + 92 + 48 + 20 + 36 = 442
- Agent 1's total valuation: 28 + 9 + 8 + 56 + 95 + 15 + 38 + 66 = 315

Next, we'll try to allocate items in a way that balances the total valuation of the items each agent receives, while also considering individual item preferences.

To achieve this, we'll start by identifying the high-value items for each agent:

- Agent 0 highly values items 1 (89), 3 (93), and 4 (92).
- Agent 1 highly values items 4 (95), 7 (66), and 3 (56).

Now, we'll allocate the items one by one, considering the highest valuations and ensuring that the distribution meets the envy-free condition:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, since it's the highest valued item for them.
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it's the second-highest valued item for them.
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, because it maximizes their remaining high values.
4. Allocate item 7 to Agent 1, as it is their second-highest valued item.
5. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0, to balance the total valuation.
6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1, since Agent 0 has already received a higher-value total.
7. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it adds significant value to their total.
8. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it's the remaining item.

Now, let's compile the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation respects the individual preferences and ensures a fair distribution of items based on the given valuations.
