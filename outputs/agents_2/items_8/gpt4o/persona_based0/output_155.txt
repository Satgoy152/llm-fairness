Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  66  29  74  28  75  56  39
1  91  95  45  62  12  85  99  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 95 45 62 12 85 99 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach. This method maximizes the product of the utilities that each agent derives from their allocation, aiming to balance fairness and efficiency.

Given the valuations of the agents for each item:

Agent 0: [93, 66, 29, 74, 28, 75, 56, 39]  
Agent 1: [91, 95, 45, 62, 12, 85, 99, 78]

Let's calculate and allocate items to achieve a fair division:

1. **Items with high disparity in valuations:**
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it much higher (99 vs. 56), so it is allocated to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it higher (95 vs. 66), so it is allocated to Agent 1.

2. **Items with moderate disparity:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it slightly higher (93 vs. 91), so it is allocated to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it higher (85 vs. 75), so it is allocated to Agent 1.

3. **Items with closer valuations:**
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it higher (74 vs. 62), so it is allocated to Agent 0.
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it higher (78 vs. 39), so it is allocated to Agent 1.

4. **Remaining items:**
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it higher (45 vs. 29), so it is allocated to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it higher (28 vs. 12), so it is allocated to Agent 0.

With this allocation, both agents receive items that align closely with their higher valuations, aiming to minimize envy and maximize fairness.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
