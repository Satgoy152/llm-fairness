Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  33   8  77  14  32  14  20
1  66  15  48  74  41  49  55  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-free allocation of the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item. The goal is to allocate items in such a way that no agent prefers the other agent's allocation to their own. One way to approach this problem is to use the "divide and choose" method or the "envy-free" allocation strategy, ensuring that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Here is the valuation table for reference:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 56      | 66      |
| 1    | 33      | 15      |
| 2    | 8       | 48      |
| 3    | 77      | 74      |
| 4    | 14      | 41      |
| 5    | 32      | 49      |
| 6    | 14      | 55      |
| 7    | 20      | 62      |

To achieve fairness, we can use the "envy-free" protocol as follows:

1. **Calculate Total Values**: First, calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
   - Agent 0: 56 + 33 + 8 + 77 + 14 + 32 + 14 + 20 = 254
   - Agent 1: 66 + 15 + 48 + 74 + 41 + 49 + 55 + 62 = 410

2. **Initial Allocation**: Greedily allocate items that have a higher valuation for each agent, while ensuring balance.
   - Agent 0 highly values items: 3, 0, 1
   - Agent 1 highly values items: 6, 7, 4

3. **Balance Allocation**: Adjust allocations to ensure an envy-free distribution.
   - Allocate remaining items to ensure fairness.

After considering the agents' valuations and balancing the total value received by each agent, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 1, 3, 4]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 56 (item 0) + 33 (item 1) + 77 (item 3) + 14 (item 4) = 180
- Agent 1 receives items: [2, 5, 6, 7]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 48 (item 2) + 49 (item 5) + 55 (item 6) + 62 (item 7) = 214

Both allocations are reasonably balanced, though not perfectly equal, but they are envy-free given the constraint of integer allocations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items that maximize their individual valuations while maintaining a fair balance between the two.
