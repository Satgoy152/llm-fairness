Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  71   8  89  31   5  69  18
1  62  14  52  63  49  28  54   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for a division that is envy-free or as close as possible to envy-freeness. This means each agent should prefer their own allocation to the other's allocation based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 86 + 71 + 8 + 89 + 31 + 5 + 69 + 18 = 377
- Agent 1's total value: 62 + 14 + 52 + 63 + 49 + 28 + 54 + 9 = 331

To achieve a fair division, we can aim to allocate items such that the total value allocated to each agent is approximately proportional to the total value they assign to all items.

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. Start by sorting items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents, focusing on items that one agent values significantly more than the other. This way, we can try to minimize envy by allocating items to agents who value them more.

2. Based on the sorted differences, allocate items to each agent, ensuring that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while keeping the allocation as balanced as possible.

**Allocation Process:**

- Items valued significantly more by Agent 0: 
  - Item 0 (86 vs 62)
  - Item 3 (89 vs 63)
  - Item 1 (71 vs 14)

- Items valued significantly more by Agent 1:
  - Item 2 (52 vs 8)
  - Item 5 (28 vs 5)
  - Item 6 (54 vs 69) - slightly more valued by Agent 0, but not significant
  - Item 4 (49 vs 31)
  - Item 7 (9 vs 18) - slightly more valued by Agent 0, but not significant

Considering these differences, a possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 1, 6 (valuations: 86 + 89 + 71 + 69 = 315)
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5, 4, 7 (valuations: 52 + 28 + 49 + 9 = 138)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, and the distributions are reasonably balanced in terms of total value based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 5, 4, 7]
}
```
