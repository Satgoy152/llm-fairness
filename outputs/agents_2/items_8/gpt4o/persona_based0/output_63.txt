Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  74  49  88  30  97  49   3
1  74  69  83  39  65  16  30  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close as possible to being envy-free. This means each agent should value their own set of items at least as much as the other agent's set.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 58 + 74 + 49 + 88 + 30 + 97 + 49 + 3 = 448
- Agent 1's total valuation: 74 + 69 + 83 + 39 + 65 + 16 + 30 + 17 = 393

To create a fair allocation, we can use a method such as the "adjusted winner procedure" or simply trial and error with an emphasis on minimizing envy and balancing valuations. Hereâ€™s a potential allocation:

1. Assign items with higher valuations to the agent who values them more, while ensuring the total value received by each agent is as close as possible.

Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3, 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4, 6, 7

Let's calculate the valuations for each agent under this allocation:

- Agent 0 values: 58 (item 0) + 74 (item 1) + 88 (item 3) + 97 (item 5) = 317
- Agent 1 values: 83 (item 2) + 65 (item 4) + 30 (item 6) + 17 (item 7) = 195

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free (since Agent 0's total is higher), but both agents do receive a significant portion of their high-valued items. Further adjustments could be made by switching lower valued items or further negotiating based on specific fairness criteria.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
