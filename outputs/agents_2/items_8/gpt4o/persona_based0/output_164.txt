Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  10  88   9  28  69   1  25
1  64  24  71  43  21  36  21  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent. Given the valuations, we'll aim to divide the items so that each agent perceives the allocation they receive as valuable as possible.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [50, 10, 88, 9, 28, 69, 1, 25]
- Agent 1: [64, 24, 71, 43, 21, 36, 21, 32]

Let's allocate items based on the maximum value each agent derives from them, while ensuring that the allocation remains fair and envy-free.

### Steps for Allocation:

1. **Highest Valuation Allocation**: Allocate items based on the highest valuation by each agent, ensuring the total perceived value is roughly balanced.

2. **Envy-Freeness**: Check allocations to ensure no agent envies the other's allocation.

#### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0** values items 2 (88) and 5 (69) highly.
- **Agent 1** values item 0 (64), item 2 (71), and item 3 (43) highly.

Let's attempt an allocation:

- Allocate **item 2** to **Agent 0** (highest value for Agent 0).
- Allocate **item 5** to **Agent 0** (second-highest for Agent 0).
- Allocate **item 0** to **Agent 1** (highest value for Agent 1, but Agent 0 values it less than item 2 and 5).
- Allocate **item 3** to **Agent 1** (high value for Agent 1, moderate for Agent 0).
- Allocate **item 1** and **item 4** to **Agent 1** (Agent 1 has higher relative preferences for these compared to Agent 0).

Now both agents have enough items, but we need to allocate the remaining items:

- Allocate **item 6** to **Agent 0** (low value for both, but Agent 0 needs more items).
- Allocate **item 7** to **Agent 1** (moderate value for both, but Agent 1 already has a slightly higher total).

#### Final Allocations:

- **Agent 0**: [2, 5, 6]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 1, 3, 4, 7]

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives, while attempting to maintain an envy-free distribution.
