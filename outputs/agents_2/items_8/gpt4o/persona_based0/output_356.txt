Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  47  13  92  70  91  79  54
1  24  89  94  78   3  51  30  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maintaining an envy-free division, we need to ensure that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocation of the other agent. One common approach to achieve this is to use the concept of the "maximum weight matching" from graph theory, where we maximize the total value each agent derives from the items they receive.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 36 + 47 + 13 + 92 + 70 + 91 + 79 + 54 = 482
- Agent 1's total valuation: 24 + 89 + 94 + 78 + 3 + 51 + 30 + 96 = 465

Now, let's find an allocation that distributes the items between the agents in such a way that the distribution is as fair as possible.

We'll focus on maximizing the total value each agent receives, keeping in mind that each agent should ideally have a similar level of satisfaction from the allocation.

One possible fair allocation can be:

- Allocate items [0, 3, 4, 5] to Agent 0
- Allocate items [1, 2, 6, 7] to Agent 1

Let's verify:

**Agent 0's valuation:**
- Item 0: 36
- Item 3: 92
- Item 4: 70
- Item 5: 91
- Total = 36 + 92 + 70 + 91 = 289

**Agent 1's valuation:**
- Item 1: 89
- Item 2: 94
- Item 6: 30
- Item 7: 96
- Total = 89 + 94 + 30 + 96 = 309

This allocation attempts to balance the satisfaction derived by each agent based on their individual valuations.

The final allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 6, 7]
}
```
