Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  16  66  68  81  37  48  72
1  22  90  83   5  38  43  31   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division based on the given valuations. The goal is to assign the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuation.

First, let's sum up the total valuation of the items for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: 87 + 16 + 66 + 68 + 81 + 37 + 48 + 72 = 475
- **Agent 1**: 22 + 90 + 83 + 5 + 38 + 43 + 31 + 1 = 313

Next, we will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent's perception of the fairness is maximized. 

One approach is to allocate items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives, taking into account their individual valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values items as follows:
   - High value items: 0 (87), 4 (81), 7 (72)
   - Medium value items: 2 (66), 3 (68)
   - Lower value items: 5 (37), 6 (48), 1 (16)

2. **Agent 1** values items as follows:
   - High value items: 1 (90), 2 (83)
   - Medium value items: 5 (43), 4 (38)
   - Lower value items: 6 (31), 0 (22), 3 (5), 7 (1)

Based on these observations, we can propose an allocation that tries to respect each agent's preferences:

- Assign high-value items for Agent 0 and try to balance with medium or lower value items for Agent 1.
- Ensure that the total perceived value for each agent feels equitable.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**:
  - Items: [0, 4, 7] (values: 87, 81, 72 → total value: 240)
  
- **Agent 1**:
  - Items: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] (values: 90, 83, 5, 43, 31 → total value: 252)

This allocation is close to balancing the total value each agent receives based on their valuation. While perfect envy-freeness is challenging, this distribution attempts to minimize envy.

Now, let's present the allocation in JSON format as requested:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
