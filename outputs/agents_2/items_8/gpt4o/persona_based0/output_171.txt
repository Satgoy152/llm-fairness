Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  90  73  78  61  35  46  72
1  42  12  61  64  42   3  94  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use an approach that maximizes each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations. The goal is to minimize envy by making sure each agent finds their bundle at least as good as the bundle of the other agent.

Here are the steps to achieve a fair division:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Sum the valuations for all items for each agent.
   
   - Agent 0: 51 + 90 + 73 + 78 + 61 + 35 + 46 + 72 = 506
   - Agent 1: 42 + 12 + 61 + 64 + 42 + 3 + 94 + 89 = 407

2. **Initial Greedy Allocation**: Allocate items to each agent based on their highest individual valuation, starting with the agent who has the higher total valuation. This is a heuristic approach to achieve a fair division.

3. **Adjust Allocation for Envy-Freeness**: Check for any possible envy situation and adjust allocations if necessary.

Based on the valuations provided, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (90), item 3 (78), and item 2 (73).
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most (94), item 7 (89), and item 3 (64).

Now considering the values and trying to balance the total value each agent receives:

- **Allocate to Agent 0**: Items with higher values for Agent 0 but balance for Agent 1's highest values.
  - Items: [0, 1, 3, 4] 
  - Total valuation for Agent 0 = 51 (Item 0) + 90 (Item 1) + 78 (Item 3) + 61 (Item 4) = 280

- **Allocate to Agent 1**: Items ensuring high value where possible.
  - Items: [2, 5, 6, 7]
  - Total valuation for Agent 1 = 61 (Item 2) + 3 (Item 5) + 94 (Item 6) + 89 (Item 7) = 247

**Final Allocation in JSON format**:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent has a strong valuation of their items. Although not perfectly envy-free, it fairly distributes items based on the highest valuations and the total worth of items allocated, achieving a balance in perceived value.
