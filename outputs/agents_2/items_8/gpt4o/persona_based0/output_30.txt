Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57   6  69  75  38  58  70  12
1  23  50  25  46  45  20  83  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can apply a method such as the adjusted winner procedure or simply balance the valuations to ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share of value.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \( 57 + 6 + 69 + 75 + 38 + 58 + 70 + 12 = 385 \)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \( 23 + 50 + 25 + 46 + 45 + 20 + 83 + 85 = 377 \)

Next, let's allocate the items in a way that attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 and item 3 highly (69 and 75 respectively).
2. Agent 1 values item 6 and item 7 highly (83 and 85 respectively).

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Assign items 0, 2, 3, and 5 to Agent 0. This gives Agent 0 a total valuation of \( 57 + 69 + 75 + 58 = 259 \).
- Assign items 1, 4, 6, and 7 to Agent 1. This gives Agent 1 a total valuation of \( 50 + 45 + 83 + 85 = 263 \).

Although this allocation doesn't achieve perfect equality in terms of value, it ensures that each agent receives items that they particularly value, which should help with the perception of fairness.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
