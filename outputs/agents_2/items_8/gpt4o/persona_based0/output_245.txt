Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  64  69  35  15  34  58  74
1  42  77  82  44  34  47  98  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share, potentially minimizing envy. 

First, let's sum up the total valuations of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 3 + 64 + 69 + 35 + 15 + 34 + 58 + 74 = 352
- Agent 1: 42 + 77 + 82 + 44 + 34 + 47 + 98 + 35 = 459

Next, let's try to allocate items to each agent in a way that attempts to balance these total valuations. We will do this by assigning items such that neither agent envies the other's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's assign items by starting with the most valued items for each agent and work our way down, while ensuring each agent gets exactly four items:

1. Agent 1 values item 6 the most (98), so we assign item 6 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 2 (82), so we assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 1 (77), so we assign item 1 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 3 (44), so we assign item 3 to Agent 1.

Agent 1's allocation: [1, 2, 3, 6]

5. Agent 0's most valued item is item 7 (74), so we assign item 7 to Agent 0.
6. Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 2, which is already assigned to Agent 1. The next available is item 1, which is also assigned to Agent 1. Next, item 6 is also assigned to Agent 1. Item 0 is left and valued at 3, but let's first assign based on the next highest available valuation: item 5 (34), so we assign item 5 to Agent 0.
7. Agent 0's next available highest value item is item 4 (15), so we assign item 4 to Agent 0.
8. Lastly, assign item 0 (3) to Agent 0.

Agent 0's allocation: [0, 4, 5, 7]

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

Agent 0: [0, 4, 5, 7]
Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 6]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives four items. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
