Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  74  36  91  92  29  45  74
1  30  81  51  62  70  94  40  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[13 74 36 91 92 29 45 74]
 [30 81 51 62 70 94 40 61]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. In this context, an allocation is considered envy-free if each agent prefers their own bundle of items or values it at least as much as the bundle received by the other agent.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [13, 74, 36, 91, 92, 29, 45, 74]
- Agent 1: [30, 81, 51, 62, 70, 94, 40, 61]

The total value each agent assigns to all items:
- Agent 0 total value: 13 + 74 + 36 + 91 + 92 + 29 + 45 + 74 = 454
- Agent 1 total value: 30 + 81 + 51 + 62 + 70 + 94 + 40 + 61 = 489

To create an envy-free allocation, we should try to allocate items such that each agent's allocation is close to half of their total valuation.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items 3 and 4 highly (91 and 92).
   - Agent 1 values items 5 and 1 highly (94 and 81).

2. **Allocate high-value items to each agent:**
   - Assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 0.
   - Assign items 5 and 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items by comparing valuations:**
   - After allocating the high-value items, consider remaining items [0, 2, 6, 7].
   - Assign items to ensure balance in total valuation.

### Allocation

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: [3, 4, 0, 6]
  - Total valuation: 91 + 92 + 13 + 45 = 241

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: [1, 5, 2, 7]
  - Total valuation: 81 + 94 + 51 + 61 = 287

### JSON Representation

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 0, 6],
    "1": [1, 5, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a set of items that maximize their happiness according to their valuations while maintaining a relative balance between the total valuations of the items they receive.
