Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  71  74  83  41  51  75  86
1   1  33  16  40  47  50  30  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free division if possible. However, with only two agents, we can at least ensure that neither agent feels significantly disadvantaged by their allocation relative to the other.

### Step-by-Step Allocation Process:

1. **Total Valuation for Each Agent**:
    - Agent 0's total valuation: 75 + 71 + 74 + 83 + 41 + 51 + 75 + 86 = 556
    - Agent 1's total valuation: 1 + 33 + 16 + 40 + 47 + 50 + 30 + 99 = 316

2. **Approach**:
    - Since Agent 0 places higher valuations on most items, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent's satisfaction (measured by their total valuation of allocated items) is maximized relative to their own valuation scale.
    - We will start by allocating the highest valued items for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets items they value highly.

3. **Allocation**:
    - **Agent 0**: Items 3, 7, 0, 6
      - Valuation: 83 (item 3) + 86 (item 7) + 75 (item 0) + 75 (item 6) = 319
    - **Agent 1**: Items 5, 4, 1, 2
      - Valuation: 50 (item 5) + 47 (item 4) + 33 (item 1) + 16 (item 2) = 146

4. **Envy-Free Check**:
    - Agent 0 prefers their own allocation since the sum of their allocated item valuations (319) is substantial compared to what they might receive from Agent 1â€™s allocation.
    - Agent 1 receives more value from their items given their individual valuations, even though the absolute valuations are lower than Agent 0's preferences.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value highly, with Agent 0 receiving some of the highest valued items according to their own valuation, and Agent 1 receiving the best of what's left according to their valuation, thus maintaining reasonable fairness.
