Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  51  15  50  15  66  52  89
1   4   5  32  81  12  11  28  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation where both agents receive an integer number of items, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. An allocation is envy-free if each agent prefers their own bundle of items over the bundle of the other agent.

Let's summarize the total valuations of the items for each agent:

- **Agent 0's Valuations:**
  - Total value = 31 + 51 + 15 + 50 + 15 + 66 + 52 + 89 = 369

- **Agent 1's Valuations:**
  - Total value = 4 + 5 + 32 + 81 + 12 + 11 + 28 + 56 = 229

The goal is to distribute the items such that both agents have a similar total valuation of their assigned items, considering their personal valuations. 

To start, we can try allocating items that have a high valuation disparity in favor of one agent. This will help in balancing the overall perceived value between the agents.

### Initial Allocation Process:

1. **Assign high-value items for Agent 0 (based on their valuations):**
   - Item 7 (value 89)
   - Item 5 (value 66)
   - Item 1 (value 51)

2. **Assign high-value items for Agent 1 (based on their valuations):**
   - Item 3 (value 81)
   - Item 2 (value 32)

### Assess Remaining Items:

The remaining items to be allocated are: 0, 4, and 6.

3. **Balancing the remaining items:**
   - For Agent 0: Item 0 (value 31)
   - For Agent 1: Item 6 (value 28)
   - The last remaining item (4) is assigned to Agent 1 as it provides a slightly better balance in the perceived total values.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [7, 5, 1, 0]
  - Total Value for Agent 0 = 89 + 66 + 51 + 31 = 237

- **Agent 1:** Items [3, 2, 6, 4]
  - Total Value for Agent 1 = 81 + 32 + 28 + 12 = 153

This allocation aims to balance the values perceived by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5, 1, 0],
    "1": [3, 2, 6, 4]
}
```
