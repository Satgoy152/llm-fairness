Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  36  86  73  75  81  16  80
1  46  65  59  14  92  68  27  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's preferences and try to distribute the items so that neither agent envies the other's allocation. 

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(6 + 36 + 86 + 73 + 75 + 81 + 16 + 80 = 453\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(46 + 65 + 59 + 14 + 92 + 68 + 27 + 69 = 440\)

Next, let's aim to allocate items such that the total value of items received by each agent is as balanced as possible:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Prefers items with higher values: 2 (86), 5 (81), 7 (80), 4 (75)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Prefers items with higher values: 4 (92), 1 (65), 0 (46), 7 (69)

We want to allocate items such that both agents feel they have received a fair share. Here's one potential allocation:

- **Allocate items to Agent 0:**
  - Items: 2, 5, 6, 0
  - Total Valuation: 86 + 81 + 16 + 6 = 189

- **Allocate items to Agent 1:**
  - Items: 4, 1, 3, 7
  - Total Valuation: 92 + 65 + 14 + 69 = 240

This allocation attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent and minimizes potential envy. Note that an envy-free allocation might not always be possible, but this is a reasonable attempt given the preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6, 0],
    "1": [4, 1, 3, 7]
}
```
