Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0  1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  9  87  55  74   5   4  33
1  17  5  61  54  35  14  88  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, or at least as fair as possible given the constraints. We'll use a strategy that tries to balance the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each item is allocated.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(38 + 9 + 87 + 55 + 74 + 5 + 4 + 33 = 305\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(17 + 5 + 61 + 54 + 35 + 14 + 88 + 76 = 350\)

Next, we will try to allocate items in such a way that both agents feel they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

The main goal is to balance the perceived value each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by looking at items that have a large difference in value between the two agents and allocate them to the agent who values them more.
   
2. Then, try to balance the remaining items to keep the total perceived value as equal as possible.

Using these principles, here's a proposed allocation:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (87 vs. 61)
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (74 vs. 35)
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (88 vs. 4)
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (76 vs. 33)

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (38 vs. 17)
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (9 vs. 5)
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (55 vs. 54)
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (14 vs. 5)

After this allocation, let's verify the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0 receives items [2, 4, 0, 3], with a total valuation of \(87 + 74 + 38 + 55 = 254\)
- Agent 1 receives items [6, 7, 1, 5], with a total valuation of \(88 + 76 + 9 + 14 = 187\)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that collectively represent a fair share according to their preferences, balancing as much as possible under the given values. Now, let's provide the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 0, 3],
    "1": [6, 7, 1, 5]
}
```
