Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  86  96  46  87  49  11   6
1  18  87  99  84   6  48  30  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 87 99 84  6 48 30 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for an envy-free allocation, we will consider the relative valuations of each item by each agent. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

First, let's list the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [91, 86, 96, 46, 87, 49, 11, 6]
- Agent 1's valuations: [18, 87, 99, 84, 6, 48, 30, 56]

To achieve fairness, one common approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the minimum satisfaction or minimizing the maximum envy. We can do this by considering each agent's highest-valued items and attempting to fairly balance the total value of items allocated to each agent.

Let's allocate items:

1. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 2 (99) and item 3 (84).
2. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 2 (96) but it is higher for Agent 1, so Agent 1 gets item 2.
3. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 0 (91) and item 4 (87).
4. **Agent 1** has a good value for item 1 (87), but it is slightly less than Agent 0's value for item 0.
5. **Agent 0** also has a reasonable value for item 5 (49).

After examining the valuations, a fair allocation that balances the total value can be:

- Assign items 2, 3, 6, and 7 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 0, 1, 4, and 5 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value relatively highly, and the total value assigned to each agent is balanced.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
