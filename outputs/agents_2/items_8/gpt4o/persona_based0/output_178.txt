Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  69  56  54  58   0  86  23
1   5  42  40  87  73  66  36  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent believes they received the best possible subset of items given their own valuations.

First, let's look at the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: \( 44 + 69 + 56 + 54 + 58 + 0 + 86 + 23 = 390 \)
- Agent 1's total value: \( 5 + 42 + 40 + 87 + 73 + 66 + 36 + 23 = 372 \)

Next, let's calculate the fair share for each agent. Since there are 8 items, we divide the total valuation of each agent by the number of items (4 items each):

- Agent 0's fair share per item: \( \frac{390}{8} = 48.75 \)
- Agent 1's fair share per item: \( \frac{372}{8} = 46.5 \)

Now, let's try to allocate the items such that each agent receives approximately their fair share:

1. **Assign items to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the highest with a value of 86.
   - Add item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Assign items to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest with a value of 87.
   - Add item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Continue Assigning**:
   - Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 1 with a value of 69.
   - Add item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's next highest valued items are item 4 with a value of 73 and item 5 with a value of 66.
   - Add item 4 and item 5 to Agent 1.

4. **Balancing Remaining Items**:
   - Remaining items: 0, 2, 7
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest among remaining items with a value of 44.
   - Add item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest among remaining items with a value of 40.
   - Add item 2 to Agent 1.
   - The last item, 7, which has relatively low values for both agents, can be assigned to Agent 0 to balance the number of items.

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints and valuations.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
