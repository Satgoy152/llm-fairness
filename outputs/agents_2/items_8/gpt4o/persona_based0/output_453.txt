Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  66  86  62  34  94  96  10
1  51  79  20   8  78  27  19  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we will aim for an envy-free distribution, where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. We will check that each item is assigned in a way that maximizes the perceived value for each agent while ensuring that neither agent envies the allocation of the other agent.

Here's how the allocations can be made:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 6 (96), item 5 (94), and item 0 (90).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 (79), item 4 (78), and item 7 (51).

Let's allocate the items based on these preferences:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the most (96 vs. 19).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the most (94 vs. 27).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the most (90 vs. 51).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most (79 vs. 66).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most (78 vs. 34).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most (51 vs. 10).

We have allocated 6 items so far. Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (2 and 3) in a way that maintains fairness:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it significantly more (86 vs. 20).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it more (8 vs. 62), but this minimizes envy since Agent 0 already has a high-value share.

This allocation results in both agents receiving items in a way that minimizes envy based on their valuations. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

This distribution tries to ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their personal valuations of the items.
