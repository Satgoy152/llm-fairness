Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  70  67  56  88  25  81  56
1  69  17  36  81  82  61  83  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we aim for an envy-free solution where each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value the other agent's allocation. We'll also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all 8 items are allocated.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(2 + 70 + 67 + 56 + 88 + 25 + 81 + 56 = 445\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(69 + 17 + 36 + 81 + 82 + 61 + 83 + 46 = 475\)

Now, let's explore possible allocations to ensure envy-freeness:

1. **Assigning high-value items:** 
   - Agent 0 highly values items 4 (88), 6 (81), and 1 (70).
   - Agent 1 highly values items 3 (81), 6 (83), and 4 (82).

2. **Avoiding envy:**
   - We should try to allocate items in such a way that both agents receive items they highly value, and neither feels envious of the other's allocation.

Considering the above points, one possible allocation is:

- **Agent 0:** Items 1, 2, 4, 5
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 3, 6, 7

Let's evaluate the total valuation for each agent with this allocation:

- **Agent 0's valuation:** \(70 (item\ 1) + 67 (item\ 2) + 88 (item\ 4) + 25 (item\ 5) = 250\)
- **Agent 1's valuation:** \(69 (item\ 0) + 81 (item\ 3) + 83 (item\ 6) + 46 (item\ 7) = 279\)

Both agents receive valuations that are significant portions of their total valuations, and this allocation minimizes envy since each agent receives items they value highly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
