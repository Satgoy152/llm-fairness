Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  37  73   9  54   0  40  57
1  45  46  53  76  86  83  42  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to allocate them in such a way that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their own valuation. We will aim to make sure that each agent believes they receive at least as much value as the other agent, based on their own valuation.

Here are the agent valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [91, 37, 73, 9, 54, 0, 40, 57]
- Agent 1: [45, 46, 53, 76, 86, 83, 42, 57]

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 91 + 37 + 73 + 9 + 54 + 0 + 40 + 57 = 361
- Total value for Agent 1: 45 + 46 + 53 + 76 + 86 + 83 + 42 + 57 = 488

Next, we employ a fair division method such as the adjusted winner procedure, aiming to divide items such that each agent feels they are getting a fair share, considering their own valuations. We can try to maximize the value for each agent while making sure no one envies the other's allocation.

Let's allocate items:

1. Start by giving each agent the item with the highest value based on their preference:

   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (value 91), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 4 (value 86), so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

2. Distribute remaining items by selecting from the highest remaining values for each agent until all items are allocated:

   - Agent 0: Allocate item 2 (value 73) to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 5 (value 83) to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0: Allocate item 7 (value 57) to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 3 (value 76) to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0: Allocate item 1 (value 37) to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 6 (value 42) to Agent 1.

Now, let's check if the allocation leads to an envy-free situation:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 2, 7, 1], with a total value of 91 + 73 + 57 + 37 = 258.
- Agent 1 receives items [4, 5, 3, 6], with a total value of 86 + 83 + 76 + 42 = 287.

Each agent's allocation is based on maximizing their own valuation, and neither agent would prefer to swap allocations based on their personal valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation is designed to be as fair as possible based on the given valuations of the items by each agent, aiming for envy-freeness.
