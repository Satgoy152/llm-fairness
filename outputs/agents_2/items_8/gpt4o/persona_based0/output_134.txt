Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  62  42  10   2  23  51  97
1  24  23  89  14  92  64  95  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should prefer their own allocation over the other's, based on their respective valuations. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 66 + 62 + 42 + 10 + 2 + 23 + 51 + 97 = 353
   - Agent 1: 24 + 23 + 89 + 14 + 92 + 64 + 95 + 36 = 437

2. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Start by allocating the most valued items to each agent based on individual preferences, ensuring no envy.

3. **Sorted Valuations**:
   - Agent 0's valuation of items (in descending order): [97, 66, 62, 51, 42, 23, 10, 2]
   - Agent 1's valuation of items (in descending order): [95, 92, 89, 64, 36, 24, 23, 14]

4. **Greedy Allocation**:
   - Allocate items starting from the most valued to minimize envy.

5. **Allocation Process**:
   - Agent 0 gets item 7 (value 97 for Agent 0, 36 for Agent 1).
   - Agent 1 gets item 6 (value 51 for Agent 0, 95 for Agent 1).
   - Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 2 for Agent 0, 92 for Agent 1).
   - Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 42 for Agent 0, 89 for Agent 1).
   - Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 66 for Agent 0, 24 for Agent 1).
   - Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 62 for Agent 0, 23 for Agent 1).
   - Agent 0 gets item 5 (value 23 for Agent 0, 64 for Agent 1).
   - Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 10 for Agent 0, 14 for Agent 1).

6. **Final Allocation**:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and minimizes envy between them. Agent 0 and Agent 1 both have items that they value highly, and both agentsâ€™ total valuations from their allocated items are relatively balanced according to their preferences.
