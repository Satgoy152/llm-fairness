Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  73  54   6  55  77   5  34
1  62  95  91  61  73  72  69  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the agents, I'll employ the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of items received by the other agent over their own. A possible approach is to use a method like the adjusted winner procedure or a simple iterative method to balance the distribution based on valuations.

Let's go through the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Valuations: [26, 73, 54, 6, 55, 77, 5, 34]

Agent 1:
- Valuations: [62, 95, 91, 61, 73, 72, 69, 39]

The goal is to allocate all 8 items between the two agents such that the allocation is as fair as possible.

One straightforward way to start is to allocate items based on which agent values them more, ensuring that each agent gets at least some items:

1. Compare each item's valuation between the two agents and allocate it to the agent with the higher valuation.
2. Ensure that the allocations are balanced in terms of the number of items each agent receives.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (62 vs 26), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (95 vs 73), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (91 vs 54), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (61 vs 6), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (73 vs 55), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (77 vs 72), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (69 vs 5), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (34 vs 39), allocate to Agent 1.

Initial allocation:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]

Agent 1 has too many items, so let's balance it by giving some items back to Agent 0 who values them reasonably close.

Reallocation based on balancing:
- Transfer Item 7 from Agent 1 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [5, 7]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items and tries to maintain envy-freeness by keeping the value balance as much as possible.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
