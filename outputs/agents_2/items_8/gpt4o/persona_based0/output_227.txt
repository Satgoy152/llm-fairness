Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  82  16  43   1  43  93  13
1  49  79  74  76  29  83  24  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [49 79 74 76 29 83 24 55]]
Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair allocation of the items between the two agents (0 and 1), we aim to allocate the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the other agent values their own, whenever possible. The goal is to minimize envy and ensure a balanced distribution based on their valuations.

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**'s valuations: [96, 82, 16, 43, 1, 43, 93, 13]
- **Agent 1**'s valuations: [49, 79, 74, 76, 29, 83, 24, 55]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most (96 vs. 49), so allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it more (82 vs. 79), so allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it more (74 vs. 16), so allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 1 values it more (76 vs. 43), so allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 1 values it more (29 vs. 1), so allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 1 values it more (83 vs. 43), so allocate to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it more (93 vs. 24), so allocate to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 1 values it more (55 vs. 13), so allocate to Agent 1.

### Resulting Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1, 6]
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]

The allocation ensures that each agent gets items that they value highly, minimizing potential envy. 

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
