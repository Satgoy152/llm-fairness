Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6  7
0  65   1  86  89  10  27  11  4
1  63  43  97  87  88  37  33  7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 43 97 87 88 37 33  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to aim for envy-freeness and equitable distribution. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of the other agent over their own allocation, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [65, 1, 86, 89, 10, 27, 11, 4]
- Agent 1: [63, 43, 97, 87, 88, 37, 33, 7]

A strategy to achieve a fair division is to allocate items such that the total value each agent perceives from their allocated items is as equal as possible. Here is the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Total Value Calculation:**
   - Calculate the total value of all items for each agent:
     - Agent 0: 65 + 1 + 86 + 89 + 10 + 27 + 11 + 4 = 293
     - Agent 1: 63 + 43 + 97 + 87 + 88 + 37 + 33 + 7 = 455

2. **Item Allocation:**
   - To balance the perceived values, we can start by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent in turns.
   
3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Start with the highest value for each agent and proceed to allocate items until all are assigned.
   
4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [2, 3, 0, 5]
     - Item 2: 86
     - Item 3: 89
     - Item 0: 65
     - Item 5: 27
     - Total value perceived by Agent 0 = 86 + 89 + 65 + 27 = 267
   - Agent 1: [4, 1, 6, 7]
     - Item 4: 88
     - Item 1: 43
     - Item 6: 33
     - Item 7: 7
     - Total value perceived by Agent 1 = 88 + 43 + 33 + 7 = 171

This allocation aims to keep values relatively balanced between agents based on their own valuations.

Final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 0, 5],
    "1": [4, 1, 6, 7]
}
```
