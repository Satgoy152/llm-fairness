Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  56  21  18  34  60  93  97
1  49  76  98  54  97  12  79  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair allocation for the two agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value from the items they receive while ensuring that no agent envies the other. Here, we aim to distribute the items in a way that the perceived value each agent assigns to their bundle is maximized relative to their preferences.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 91 + 56 + 21 + 18 + 34 + 60 + 93 + 97 = 470
- Agent 1's total value: 49 + 76 + 98 + 54 + 97 + 12 + 79 + 52 = 417

Given these total values, we aim to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. 

To start, we will evaluate allocation possibilities to balance the total value perceived by each agent. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each agent picks the most valuable item available to them in turns, starting with the agent with the highest single-item valuation.

1. Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 98).
2. Agent 0 picks item 7 (value 97).
3. Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 93).
4. Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 97).
5. Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 76).
6. Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 91).
7. Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 54).
8. Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 60).

Now, let's check the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 7, 6, 5; Value = 91 + 97 + 93 + 60 = 341
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4, 1, 3; Value = 98 + 97 + 76 + 54 = 325

This allocation gives each agent a fair share, balancing the total perceived value close to each other. Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
