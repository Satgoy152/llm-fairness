Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  72  38  25  40  79  98   8
1  31  83  47  78  77  64  70  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for every item. Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, and no agent envies the other based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations:
- Agent 0's total valuation for all items: \( 9 + 72 + 38 + 25 + 40 + 79 + 98 + 8 = 369 \)
- Agent 1's total valuation for all items: \( 31 + 83 + 47 + 78 + 77 + 64 + 70 + 55 = 505 \)

One common approach to achieve a fair division is to attempt to maximize the minimum value each agent receives based on their own valuations. This can sometimes be referred to as maximizing the minimum utility.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items from each agent's perspective until we reach a balance:

   - Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (98), so assign item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (83), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.

2. Continue assigning items to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

   - Agent 0's current items: [6] with a valuation of 98.
   - Agent 1's current items: [1] with a valuation of 83.

3. Assign the next highest valued items:

   - Agent 0 values item 5 next (79), so assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 next (78), so assign item 3 to Agent 1.

4. Continue this process:

   - Agent 0's items: [6, 5], total valuation: 98 + 79 = 177.
   - Agent 1's items: [1, 3], total valuation: 83 + 78 = 161.

5. Assign the next best items:

   - Agent 0 values item 1 next (72), but it is already taken. So, assign item 4 to Agent 0 (40).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 next (77), so assign item 4 to Agent 1.

6. Continue assigning:

   - Agent 0's items: [6, 5, 0], total valuation: 98 + 79 + 9 = 186.
   - Agent 1's items: [1, 3, 4], total valuation: 83 + 78 + 77 = 238.

7. Assign the remaining items:

   - Agent 0 values item 2 (38), assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 next (55), assign item 7 to Agent 1.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [6, 5, 0, 2], total valuation: 98 + 79 + 9 + 38 = 224.
- Agent 1: [1, 3, 4, 7], total valuation: 83 + 78 + 77 + 55 = 293.

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation for each agent as fairly as possible while ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable share of their most valued items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
