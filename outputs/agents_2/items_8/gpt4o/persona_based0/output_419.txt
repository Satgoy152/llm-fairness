Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  84  76  66  50   8  92  50
1  19  43  21  23  34  99  56  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. Our goal is to ensure that the distribution is envy-free as much as possible, meaning each agent should feel that they received an allocation that is at least as valuable as what the other agent received, based on their valuations.

Let's summarize the agents' valuations for reference:

- **Agent 0's valuations**: [66, 84, 76, 66, 50, 8, 92, 50]
- **Agent 1's valuations**: [19, 43, 21, 23, 34, 99, 56, 53]

Now, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 (84), 2 (76), and 6 (92). Assigning these high-value items to Agent 0 would maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 5 (99). Assigning this item to Agent 1 is key to ensuring minimal envy from their perspective.
3. We need to allocate the remaining items (0, 3, 4, and 7) in a way that balances the total value each agent perceives they receive:

   - For item 0: Agent 0 values it at 66 and Agent 1 at 19. It's more beneficial for Agent 0.
   - For item 3: Agent 0 values it at 66 and Agent 1 at 23. It's more beneficial for Agent 0.
   - For item 4: Agent 0 values it at 50 and Agent 1 at 34. It's more beneficial for Agent 0.
   - For item 7: Agent 0 values it at 50 and Agent 1 at 53. It's more beneficial for Agent 1, although close.

Considering these valuations, an allocation that respects the agents' preferences as much as possible is:

- Assign items 1, 2, 6, 0, 3, and 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 5 and 7 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items they value most (1, 2, 6) and balances the rest, while Agent 1 receives the item they value most (5) and another item they value significantly (7).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [5, 7]
}
```
