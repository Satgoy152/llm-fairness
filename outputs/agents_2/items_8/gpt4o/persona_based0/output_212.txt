Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  77  41   2   4  52  40  97
1  10   2  14  88  17  67  34  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and tries to be as equitable as possible based on their preferences.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all the items and their fair share:

- **Agent 0's total valuation**: \(28 + 77 + 41 + 2 + 4 + 52 + 40 + 97 = 341\)
- **Agent 1's total valuation**: \(10 + 2 + 14 + 88 + 17 + 67 + 34 + 55 = 287\)

Given there are 8 items, each agent should ideally receive a total valuation that is proportional to their total valuation:

- **Proportional share for Agent 0**: \( \frac{341}{628} \times 8 \approx 4.34 \) items
- **Proportional share for Agent 1**: \( \frac{287}{628} \times 8 \approx 3.66 \) items

Since we need to allocate full items, we aim to have Agent 0 receive 4 items and Agent 1 receive 4 items, given their close proportional shares.

To achieve this, let's try to allocate the items by maximizing each agent's total perceived value and minimizing envy:

1. **Allocate items to maximize Agent 0's value:**
   - Agent 0 values item 7 the highest (97), then item 1 (77), followed by item 0 (28), and item 2 (41).
   - Allocate items 7, 1, 0, and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Allocate remaining items to Agent 1:**
   - Allocate the remaining items 3, 4, 5, and 6 to Agent 1.

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0's items**: 0, 1, 2, 7
  - Total value for Agent 0: \(28 + 77 + 41 + 97 = 243\)

- **Agent 1's items**: 3, 4, 5, 6
  - Total value for Agent 1: \(88 + 17 + 67 + 34 = 206\)

This allocation appears reasonably fair and proportional, as both agents receive 4 items, and the allocation minimizes total envy given the constraints.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
