Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  79  98  88  67  85  76  48
1  39  47  11  40  59  28  23  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the method of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. We aim to allocate the items such that neither agent envies the other, meaning each believes they have received an equal or better value than the other agent.

Given the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Items: 83, 79, 98, 88, 67, 85, 76, 48

Agent 1:
- Items: 39, 47, 11, 40, 59, 28, 23, 75

Let's calculate the total value for each agent if they received all the items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 83 + 79 + 98 + 88 + 67 + 85 + 76 + 48 = 624
- Total value for Agent 1: 39 + 47 + 11 + 40 + 59 + 28 + 23 + 75 = 322

Since Agent 0 has higher valuations overall, we should aim to balance the allocation such that the perceived value is as equal as possible.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Allocate high-value items for each agent considering their specific valuations.
2. Aim for an equal or fair total valuation for both agents.

After analyzing the values for each item, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items that maximize their value without exceeding Agent 1's perceived value.
- Agent 1 receives items that maximize their value given Agent 0's choices.

Considering the valuations, a possible fair division could be:

- Allocate items 2, 3, 4, 7 to Agent 0
- Allocate items 0, 1, 5, 6 to Agent 1

Now, let's verify the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 98 (item 2) + 88 (item 3) + 67 (item 4) + 48 (item 7) = 301
- Agent 1: 83 (item 0) + 79 (item 1) + 28 (item 5) + 23 (item 6) = 213

This allocation ensures that neither agent envies the other significantly given their valuations. It also balances the total value as closely as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 6]
}
```
