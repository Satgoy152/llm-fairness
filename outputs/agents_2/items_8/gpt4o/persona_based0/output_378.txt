Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  22  31  78  53   9  92  14
1  53  77  30  56  76  16  66  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness or as close to envy-freeness as possible, we need to consider each agent's preferences and try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 27 + 22 + 31 + 78 + 53 + 9 + 92 + 14 = 326
- Agent 1: 53 + 77 + 30 + 56 + 76 + 16 + 66 + 82 = 456

The aim is to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as equal as possible, given their subjective valuations.

One approach to this problem is to use a greedy algorithm that allocates the next most valuable item to the agent who currently has the least total value.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Initialize Total Values**: Start with both agents having a total value of 0.
2. **Greedy Allocation**: Allocate items one by one to the agent who has the lower total value at that point:

   - **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the highest (92), allocate to Agent 0.
   - **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it the highest (82), allocate to Agent 1.
   - **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the highest (78), allocate to Agent 0.
   - **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the highest (76), allocate to Agent 1.
   - **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the highest (77), allocate to Agent 1.
   - **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it higher (53), allocate to Agent 1.
   - **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the highest (31), allocate to Agent 0.
   - **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the highest (9), allocate to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [6, 3, 2, 5]
- **Agent 1**: Items [7, 4, 1, 0]

### Total Values:

- **Agent 0**: 92 + 78 + 31 + 9 = 210
- **Agent 1**: 82 + 76 + 77 + 53 = 288

This allocation attempts to balance the total subjective value each agent receives while ensuring each gets an integer number of items and considering their preferences.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3, 2, 5],
    "1": [7, 4, 1, 0]
}
```
