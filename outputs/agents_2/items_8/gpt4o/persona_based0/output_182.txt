Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  55  26  73  61  88   2  36
1  78  44   6  14  26  88  87  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly, we aim to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their share and that there is no envy between the agents. One way to achieve this is to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while keeping the allocation envy-free.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent without causing envy. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 has high values for items 3, 5, and 4.
   - Agent 1 has high values for items 0, 5, and 6.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0. Both agents value item 5 highly, but it balances better with Agent 0's other high-value items.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it has a high value for them and a relatively low value for Agent 1.
   - Assign items 0 and 6 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values these items highly, and they are less valuable to Agent 0.
   - Items 1, 2, 4, and 7 should be distributed to balance the total value for each agent.

3. **Balancing Remaining Items:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 has a slightly higher valuation.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 to balance the total valuation.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 and item 7 to Agent 1.

**Final Allocations:**
Here's the final allocation of items to the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value based on their individual valuations.
