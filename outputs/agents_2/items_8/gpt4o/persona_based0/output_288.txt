Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  78  46   6  62  26  47  47
1  83  69  30  64  14  90  85  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent values their allocation at least as much as the other's. A common approach in such problems is to maximize the minimum utility each agent receives.

Here are the valuations for each item by both agents:

- Agent 0 values: [88, 78, 46, 6, 62, 26, 47, 47]
- Agent 1 values: [83, 69, 30, 64, 14, 90, 85, 27]

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0's priorities**: Items with the highest value for Agent 0 are [0: 88, 1: 78, 4: 62, 6: 47, 7: 47].
2. **Agent 1's priorities**: Items with the highest value for Agent 1 are [5: 90, 6: 85, 3: 64, 0: 83, 1: 69].

Given these priorities, and to ensure a fair division, we can start by allocating items based on where there's a large difference in valuation:

- **Item 5** to Agent 1 (value is significantly higher for Agent 1)
- **Item 0** to Agent 0 (value is significantly higher for Agent 0)
- **Item 3** to Agent 1 (higher for Agent 1)
- **Item 4** to Agent 0 (higher for Agent 0)
- **Item 6** to Agent 1 (higher for Agent 1)
- **Item 1** to Agent 0 (higher for Agent 0)
- **Item 2** to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has a higher valuation)
- **Item 7** to Agent 1 (Agent 1 has a lower valuation but to balance the number of items)

Let's verify:

- **Agent 0 receives items**: 0, 1, 2, 4
- **Agent 1 receives items**: 3, 5, 6, 7

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 88 + 78 + 46 + 62 = 274
- Agent 1's total valuation: 64 + 90 + 85 + 27 = 266

This allocation is fair in the sense that neither agent envies the other's allocation, given the constraints of integer allocations and prioritizing higher-valued items.

Finally, we give the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
