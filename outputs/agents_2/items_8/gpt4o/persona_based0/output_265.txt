Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  50  66  88   4  77  84  99
1  84  20   6  26  41  56  17  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents using the concept of envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. One possible approach is to use an algorithm like the adjusted winner procedure, but since this scenario involves only two agents and a small number of items, we can attempt a manual allocation that minimizes envy.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [83, 50, 66, 88, 4, 77, 84, 99]
- Agent 1's valuations: [84, 20, 6, 26, 41, 56, 17, 87]

A good strategy is to try and allocate items so that the total value perceived by each agent is as balanced as possible.

### Initial Allocation:
1. **Agent 0**:
   - Pick high-value items for Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 5, 6
   - Allocated items: [0, 3, 6, 5]
   - Total value for Agent 0: 83 + 88 + 84 + 77 = 332

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Pick high-value items for Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 7, 2
   - Allocated items: [1, 4, 7, 2]
   - Total value for Agent 1: 20 + 41 + 87 + 6 = 154

### Adjustments:
The initial allocation skews heavily in favor of Agent 0. To balance the allocation, we may need to swap a high-value item from Agent 0 with a lower value one from Agent 1.

1. Swap item 6 (Agent 0's valuation 84) with item 7 (Agent 1's valuation 87).
   - Agent 0 gets [0, 3, 5, 7]
   - Agent 1 gets [1, 4, 6, 2]

2. **Recalculate Totals:**
   - Agent 0: 83 + 88 + 77 + 99 = 347
   - Agent 1: 20 + 41 + 84 + 6 = 151

After reviewing, it's clear a perfect balance isn't achievable with integer allocations due to the significant differences in valuations. However, this allocation ensures both agents get items they value highly, minimizing potential envy.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance total perceived value between the agents while ensuring each agent receives a portion of their highest-valued items.
