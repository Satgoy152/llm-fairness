Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  36  60  80  43  71  94  57
1  87  75  75  86  42  30  42  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is as envy-free as possible, we'll consider the valuations of each agent for the items. A common approach for such problems is to use a max-min or envy-free strategy, where we try to minimize the envy each agent might have for the other's allocation.

Let's calculate the envy-free allocation:

### Step-by-Step Allocation

1. **List Agents' Preferences**:
   - Agent 0's highest value items (in descending order): 6 (94), 3 (80), 5 (71), 2 (60), 7 (57), 0 (43), 4 (43), 1 (36).
   - Agent 1's highest value items (in descending order): 0 (87), 3 (86), 1 (75), 2 (75), 4 (42), 6 (42), 5 (30), 7 (12).

2. **Allocate Items by Highest Valuation**:
   - Start by allocating items to each agent based on their highest valuation to avoid envy.

3. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Allocate Item 6 (94), Item 3 (80).
   - Agent 1: Allocate Item 0 (87), Item 1 (75).

4. **Continue Allocating Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0 then chooses Item 5 (71).
   - Agent 1 chooses Item 2 (75).

5. **Balance the Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0 chooses Item 7 (57).
   - Agent 1 chooses Item 4 (42).

6. **Review the Allocation**:
   - Now each agent has received 4 items.

### Final Allocation:

The allocation is fair and envy-free under the circumstances and respects each agent's preferences as much as possible.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent's highest valued items are prioritized and are as balanced as possible given the constraints.
