Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  52  49  78  31  25  31  15
1  93  31  85  20  76   2  34  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure an equitable distribution based on their valuations. We will use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives, ensuring that both agents receive a fair share according to their valuation while keeping the allocation envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible.

Here's the step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 58 + 52 + 49 + 78 + 31 + 25 + 31 + 15 = 339
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 93 + 31 + 85 + 20 + 76 + 2 + 34 + 86 = 427

2. **Determine Fair Share for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's fair share (half of total valuation): 339 / 2 = 169.5
   - Agent 1's fair share (half of total valuation): 427 / 2 = 213.5

3. **Allocate Items to Maximize Each Agent's Received Value:**
   - Sort items by the difference in valuation between the two agents, allocating items where the difference is greatest in the agent's favor.
   - For each item, determine the agent who values it more and allocate the item to that agent, ensuring that the sum of each agent's received value is close to their fair share.

4. **Item Allocation:**
   - Items allocated to Agent 0: [0, 3, 5, 6, 7]
   - Items allocated to Agent 1: [1, 2, 4]

5. **Verify Total Allocated Values:**
   - Agent 0's allocated value: 58 (item 0) + 78 (item 3) + 25 (item 5) + 31 (item 6) + 15 (item 7) = 207
   - Agent 1's allocated value: 31 (item 1) + 85 (item 2) + 76 (item 4) = 192

This allocation results in Agent 0 receiving slightly more than their fair share, but both allocations are close to the fair shares, and the total number of items is correctly distributed.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
