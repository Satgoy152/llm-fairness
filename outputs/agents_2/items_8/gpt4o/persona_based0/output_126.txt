Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  67  52  81  26  79   5  77
1   9   2  11  30  65  39  68   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents such that envy-freeness is maximized, we need to consider each agent's valuation of each item. Our goal is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly and that minimizes any potential envy.

Considering the valuations provided, we will proceed by evaluating the total value each agent would receive from potential allocations, trying to distribute the items such that the difference in total value between the agents is minimized.

Here are the valuations for each item by both agents:

- Agent 0: [82, 67, 52, 81, 26, 79, 5, 77]
- Agent 1: [9, 2, 11, 30, 65, 39, 68, 7]

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 4 and 6.

A simple allocation could be:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3, 5, 7
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4, 6

However, this results in Agent 0 receiving five items and Agent 1 receiving three. Since we need to allocate exactly four items to each agent, we need to adjust the allocation.

Considering the values and the need for balance:

- Assign items with high values for Agent 0: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Assign items with high values for Agent 1: 2, 4, 6, and one more item with a low value for Agent 0.

Let's allocate the items as follows for a more balanced distribution:
- Agent 0: [0, 3, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 4, 6]

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0 a total valuation of: 82 (item 0) + 81 (item 3) + 79 (item 5) + 77 (item 7) = 319
- Agent 1 a total valuation of: 2 (item 1) + 11 (item 2) + 65 (item 4) + 68 (item 6) = 146

Both agents receive four items, and this allocation respects the integer number of items requirement. It also attempts to balance the envy by ensuring each agent gets the items they value more highly.

Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
