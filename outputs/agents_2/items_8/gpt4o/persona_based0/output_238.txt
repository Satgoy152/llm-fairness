Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  26  68  38  44  89  35   7
1  56  70  79  67  53  26  18  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To determine a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness, which aims to ensure that each agent prefers their own allocation over the allocation of the other agent.

First, let's summarize the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: 86, 26, 68, 38, 44, 89, 35, 7
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 86 + 26 + 68 + 38 + 44 + 89 + 35 + 7 = 393

- Agent 1's valuations: 56, 70, 79, 67, 53, 26, 18, 59
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 56 + 70 + 79 + 67 + 53 + 26 + 18 + 59 = 428

The goal is to allocate the items such that both agents feel they received a fair share according to their valuations. Since there are 8 items, each agent should ideally get 4 items to ensure an integer allocation.

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can try to balance the total perceived value of each agent's allocation.

Let's go through a possible allocation process:

1. Assign items to Agent 0 based on high valuations, attempting to balance the total value for both agents.

Agent 0 highly values items 0, 5, 2, and 4, which have values 86, 89, 68, and 44 respectively. This sums up to 287.

2. Assign items to Agent 1 based on high valuations, ensuring they also have a balanced total value.

Agent 1 highly values items 2, 3, 1, and 7, which have values 79, 67, 70, and 59 respectively. However, since item 2 is already assigned to Agent 0, Agent 1 can be assigned items 1, 3, 6, and 7, with values 70, 67, 18, and 59 respectively. This sums up to 214.

Now, let's check if this allocation is envy-free:

- Agent 0's allocation: Items 0, 5, 2, and 4, valued at 287 in total.
- Agent 1's allocation: Items 1, 3, 6, and 7, valued at 214 in total.

Both agents have four items, and we can reassess if either agent would prefer the other's allocation. In this allocation, Agent 0 has a significantly higher valuation, so we may need to adjust item 4 for item 1 to balance better:

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5, 2, and 7, valued at 86 + 89 + 68 + 7 = 250
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 4, and 6, valued at 70 + 67 + 53 + 18 = 208

This allocation is more balanced considering the valuations distribution.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 2, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
