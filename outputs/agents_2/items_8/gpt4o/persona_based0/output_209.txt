Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  28  71  98  34  69  48  50
1  70  41   4   4  80  41  51  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation based on their preferences. We aim to distribute the items such that neither agent envies the other's allocation if possible.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive if they were given each item optimally based on their valuations:

**Agent 0's Valuations:**
- Item 0: 73
- Item 1: 28
- Item 2: 71
- Item 3: 98
- Item 4: 34
- Item 5: 69
- Item 6: 48
- Item 7: 50

**Agent 1's Valuations:**
- Item 0: 70
- Item 1: 41
- Item 2: 4
- Item 3: 4
- Item 4: 80
- Item 5: 41
- Item 6: 51
- Item 7: 11

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. Start by sorting the items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more, while ensuring both agents get four items each since there are eight items in total.

**Allocation Process:**

- **Item 3**: Agent 0 (98 vs 4)
- **Item 0**: Agent 0 (73 vs 70)
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 (71 vs 4)
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 (69 vs 41)

- **Item 4**: Agent 1 (80 vs 34)
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 (41 vs 28)
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 (51 vs 48)
- **Item 7**: Agent 1 (11 vs 50)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives four items, and the allocation is done based on maximizing each agentâ€™s preferences as much as possible.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, 3, and 5, while Agent 1 receives items 1, 4, 6, and 7.
