Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  42   3  17  55  89  80   4
1  12  14  35   0  77  72   1  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. A possible approach to achieve this is to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their valuations for each item. Given that we only have two agents, we can use a simple approach to balance their allocations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 59 + 42 + 3 + 17 + 55 + 89 + 80 + 4 = 349
- Agent 1's total valuation: 12 + 14 + 35 + 0 + 77 + 72 + 1 + 96 = 307

To achieve an allocation that is envy-free, we can use a method where each agent gets approximately half of the total value according to their own valuation. Since we have 8 items, each agent should ideally get around 4 items.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Start by giving each agent the items they value the highest.
2. Ensure that both agents have a sum of values that is as close as possible.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0** values item 5 the highest (89), item 6 (80), item 0 (59), and item 4 (55).
- **Agent 1** values item 7 the highest (96), item 4 (77), item 5 (72), and item 2 (35).

#### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 5, 6, 0, 4
   - Total value: 89 + 80 + 59 + 55 = 283

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 7, 1, 2, 3
   - Total value: 96 + 14 + 35 + 0 = 145

This allocation is not perfectly balanced in terms of total value, but it ensures that each agent receives items they highly value.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 0, 4],
    "1": [7, 1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation strives to achieve fairness by ensuring that each agent receives items that they value highly, within the constraints of integer allocations.
