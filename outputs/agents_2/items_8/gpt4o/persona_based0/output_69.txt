Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73   3  76  79  39  44  19  43
1  72  60  47  28  91  55  83  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division with a focus on envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations. Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items and then find a way to allocate them that minimizes envy.

Agent 0's total valuation:
- Items: 73, 3, 76, 79, 39, 44, 19, 43
- Total: 73 + 3 + 76 + 79 + 39 + 44 + 19 + 43 = 376

Agent 1's total valuation:
- Items: 72, 60, 47, 28, 91, 55, 83, 32
- Total: 72 + 60 + 47 + 28 + 91 + 55 + 83 + 32 = 468

Let's distribute the items with the goal of minimizing envy. We'll try to balance the total valuation each agent receives according to their own valuation scale.

One strategy is to allocate items in a way that each agent receives approximately half of their total valuation:

1. Calculate the target valuation for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 376 / 2 = 188
   - Agent 1: 468 / 2 = 234

2. Begin allocating items to approach these target valuations:

   - Assign item 4 (value 39 for Agent 0, value 91 for Agent 1) to Agent 1, as 91 is highly valued by Agent 1.
   - Assign item 5 (value 44 for Agent 0, value 55 for Agent 1) to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 6 (value 19 for Agent 0, value 83 for Agent 1) to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 1 (value 3 for Agent 0, value 60 for Agent 1) to Agent 1.

   (Agent 1's current valuation: 91 + 55 + 83 + 60 = 289, just above target)

   - Assign item 0 (value 73 for Agent 0, value 72 for Agent 1) to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 (value 76 for Agent 0, value 47 for Agent 1) to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 (value 79 for Agent 0, value 28 for Agent 1) to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 7 (value 43 for Agent 0, value 32 for Agent 1) to Agent 0.

   (Agent 0's current valuation: 73 + 76 + 79 + 43 = 271, above target)

This allocation results in both agents receiving a fair share according to their valuations, minimizing envy.

Final allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
