Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  56  11  74  90  48   1  49
1  27  39  66  67  48  43  82  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [27 39 66 67 48 43 82 86]]
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 8 items between the two agents in such a way that the allocation is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that neither agent would prefer the items allocated to the other agent over their own allocation.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(37 + 56 + 11 + 74 + 90 + 48 + 1 + 49 = 366\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(27 + 39 + 66 + 67 + 48 + 43 + 82 + 86 = 458\)

We will aim to allocate the items such that both agents' perceived values of their allocations are as balanced as possible.

Let's try to allocate items by giving higher-valued items according to each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 0**
   - Highest valued items for Agent 0:
     - Item 4: 90
     - Item 3: 74
     - Item 1: 56
     - Item 5: 48
   - Total value for Agent 0: \(90 + 74 + 56 + 48 = 268\)

2. **Agent 1**
   - Highest valued items for Agent 1:
     - Item 7: 86
     - Item 6: 82
     - Item 2: 66
     - Item 0: 27
   - Total value for Agent 1: \(86 + 82 + 66 + 27 = 261\)

These allocations ensure each agent receives 4 items, and the total perceived value is relatively balanced between both agents. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 6, 7]
}
```
