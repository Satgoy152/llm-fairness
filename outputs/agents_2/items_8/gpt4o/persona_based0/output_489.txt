Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48   7  11  67  90  34  47  60
1  37  80  49  65  11  57  16  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given that envy-freeness is not always possible with discrete items.

Let's evaluate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(48 + 7 + 11 + 67 + 90 + 34 + 47 + 60 = 364\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(37 + 80 + 49 + 65 + 11 + 57 + 16 + 92 = 407\)

We aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. 

One approach to achieve a fair division is to use the method of "balanced valuations," where we try to allocate items in a manner that balances the perceived value for each agent.

Considering the valuations, it seems beneficial to start by giving each agent items they value highly compared to the other agent.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. Give item 4 to Agent 0 (valued at 90 by Agent 0 vs. 11 by Agent 1).
2. Give item 7 to Agent 1 (valued at 92 by Agent 1 vs. 60 by Agent 0).
3. Give item 3 to Agent 0 (valued at 67 by Agent 0 vs. 65 by Agent 1).
4. Give item 1 to Agent 1 (valued at 80 by Agent 1 vs. 7 by Agent 0).
5. Give item 0 to Agent 0 (valued at 48 by Agent 0 vs. 37 by Agent 1).
6. Give item 5 to Agent 1 (valued at 57 by Agent 1 vs. 34 by Agent 0).
7. Give item 6 to Agent 0 (valued at 47 by Agent 0 vs. 16 by Agent 1).
8. Give item 2 to Agent 1 (valued at 49 by Agent 1 vs. 11 by Agent 0).

**Final allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items 4, 3, 0, 6.
- Agent 1: Items 7, 1, 5, 2.

This allocation maximizes the fairness based on each agent's valuation of the items. Each agent receives items they relatively value more, and the total number of items is precisely 8.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3, 0, 6],
    "1": [7, 1, 5, 2]
}
```
