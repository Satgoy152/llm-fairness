Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53   4  35  29  29  32  43  57
1  65  28  40  50  83  88  29  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy between the agents. The concept of envy-freeness in fair division requires that each agent prefers their own allocation over the allocation of any other agent, based on their valuations.

Here, we have two agents and eight items. We'll use the items' valuations to guide the allocation process. One possible approach is to use an algorithm like the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or a heuristic that balances the total value each agent receives, without exceeding the total number of items available.

Let's analyze the agents' preferences for the items:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [53, 4, 35, 29, 29, 32, 43, 57]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [65, 28, 40, 50, 83, 88, 29, 30]

We can calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 282
- Total value for Agent 1: 413

Given the valuations, we should aim to balance the total value received by each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

After examining the valuations, a possible envy-free allocation can be:

- Assign items 0, 2, 5, and 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 3, 4, and 6 to Agent 1.

Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 2, 5, 7] with values [53, 35, 32, 57] totaling 177.
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 3, 4, 6] with values [28, 50, 83, 29] totaling 190.

This allocation is relatively balanced in terms of the total value each agent receives, and each agent gets four items, ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
