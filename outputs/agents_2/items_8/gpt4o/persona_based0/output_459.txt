Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  57  29  31  82  79  29  42
1  16  84  65  11  14  51  23   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents using the concept of envy-freeness, we want to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as the other agent's allocation based on their valuations. This involves maximizing each agent's valuation of the items they receive while balancing total value across both agents.

Here are the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [75, 57, 29, 31, 82, 79, 29, 42]
- Agent 1's valuations: [16, 84, 65, 11, 14, 51, 23, 4]

### Strategy
1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Start by identifying items that have a high valuation for one agent and a low valuation for the other to minimize envy.
2. **Allocate Uniquely Valued Items**: Assign items that are clearly more valuable to one agent than the other.
3. **Balance Remaining Items**: Allocate remaining items by balancing total valuations to ensure envy-freeness.

### Allocation Steps

1. **Identify and Allocate Items**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 4 (82) and item 5 (79), while Agent 1 values these much less. Assign these to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (84) and item 2 (65), significantly more than Agent 0. Assign these to Agent 1.

2. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Compare valuations for the remaining items (0, 3, 6, 7).
   - Agent 0: [75 (0), 31 (3), 29 (6), 42 (7)]
   - Agent 1: [16 (0), 11 (3), 23 (6), 4 (7)]

   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it more (75 vs 16).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it more (31 vs 11).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as the overall value distribution benefits from balancing (23 vs 29).
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0, as they value it more (42 vs 4).

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items with higher personal valuations, providing an envy-free distribution as much as possible given the constraints of integer allocation. Agent 0 receives a total valuation of 75 (0) + 31 (3) + 82 (4) + 79 (5) + 42 (7) = 309, while Agent 1 receives 84 (1) + 65 (2) + 23 (6) = 172.
