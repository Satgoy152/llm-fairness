Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  25   4   9  45  44  14  56
1  21  50  45  57  27  71  99  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider a division that respects the agents' valuations as much as possible. A common goal is to achieve an envy-free allocation, meaning that each agent prefers their own bundle of items over the other agent's bundle, based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [73, 25, 4, 9, 45, 44, 14, 56]
- Agent 1: [21, 50, 45, 57, 27, 71, 99, 53]

One potential approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives, while trying to balance the difference in total value between the agents to minimize envy. Let's calculate the total value for each agent for potential allocations:

1. **Calculate each agent's total value for every possible allocation.** We need to ensure that each agent receives 4 items since there are 8 items in total.

2. **Allocate items to ensure fairness:** We aim to minimize the difference in total value between the agents.

Based on the given valuations, a reasonable allocation that attempts to balance the total value is:

- Assign items [0, 4, 5, 7] to Agent 0.
- Assign items [1, 2, 3, 6] to Agent 1.

**Valuations for this allocation:**
- Agent 0: 73 (item 0) + 45 (item 4) + 44 (item 5) + 56 (item 7) = 218
- Agent 1: 50 (item 1) + 45 (item 2) + 57 (item 3) + 99 (item 6) = 251

This allocation gives a relatively balanced division of value between the agents. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation is made with the intention of fairness and minimizing envy as much as possible given the constraints.
