Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  86  47   9  55   6  25  70
1  83  56  50  84  89  64  96  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation and minimize envy between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair, ideally minimizing the difference in their perceived value of the allocation compared to what the other agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Total Valuation Calculation**: First, we calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

   - Agent 0: 51 + 86 + 47 + 9 + 55 + 6 + 25 + 70 = 349
   - Agent 1: 83 + 56 + 50 + 84 + 89 + 64 + 96 + 49 = 571

2. **Fair Share**: Each agent should ideally receive items worth at least half of their total valuation to ensure some level of fairness. However, since the total number of items is small, we must balance this with the need to allocate whole items.

3. **Allocation Strategy**: We'll use a method to allocate the items that attempts to minimize envy, distributing items to each agent based on their highest valuations first.

4. **Greedy Allocation**: Start by assigning the highest value items to each agent by iteratively checking which agent values the item more until all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for items: 6 (96), 4 (89), 3 (84).
- **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for items: 1 (86), 0 (51), 7 (70).
- Remaining items are: 2, 5.

Next, we allocate the remaining items:

- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 50, while Agent 0 values it at 47. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 64, while Agent 0 values it at 6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 0, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [6, 4, 3, 2, 5]

Now, let's present the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 7],
    "1": [6, 4, 3, 2, 5]
}
```
