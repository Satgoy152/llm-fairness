Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  14  94  17  61  31  81  83
1  89  78  49   3  20  59  59  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 78 49  3 20 59 59 22]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common method to achieve fairness is to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, meaning that no agent would prefer to have the allocation of the other agent based on their individual valuations.

Let's detail the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 14
  - Item 2: 94
  - Item 3: 17
  - Item 4: 61
  - Item 5: 31
  - Item 6: 81
  - Item 7: 83

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 78
  - Item 2: 49
  - Item 3: 3
  - Item 4: 20
  - Item 5: 59
  - Item 6: 59
  - Item 7: 22

A straightforward way to ensure envy-freeness is to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly relative to the other agent's valuations. We'll proceed with this approach:

1. Compare the valuations for each item and allocate the item to the agent with the higher valuation.
2. If both agents value an item equally, we can allocate it based on overall balance (ensuring each agent gets an equal or nearly equal number of items).

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (89 vs 75)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (78 vs 14)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (94 vs 49)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (17 vs 3)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (61 vs 20)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (59 vs 31)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (81 vs 59)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (83 vs 22)

This allocation gives 5 items to Agent 0 and 3 items to Agent 1. Adjusting for a more balanced allocation:

To balance the number of items, we can swap one item between the agents:

- Swap Item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.
  
The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 4, 5]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5]
}
```
