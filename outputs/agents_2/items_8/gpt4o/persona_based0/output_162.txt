Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  13  44  87  48  34   7  91
1  72  14  74  57  91  35  49  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent believes they received at least as much value as the other agent from their allocated items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the valuations for each agent:**

    - Agent 0: [42, 13, 44, 87, 48, 34, 7, 91]
    - Agent 1: [72, 14, 74, 57, 91, 35, 49, 54]

2. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent:**

    - Total valuation for Agent 0: 42 + 13 + 44 + 87 + 48 + 34 + 7 + 91 = 366
    - Total valuation for Agent 1: 72 + 14 + 74 + 57 + 91 + 35 + 49 + 54 = 446

3. **Determine allocations to minimize envy:**

    Given that the total value differs between agents, we'll prioritize allocating high-value items to the agent that values them more, while ensuring that the total value balance is close to each agent's proportional share of the total.

4. **Allocate the items:**

    - Start by allocating items that have a significant preference difference between agents. 
    - Identify items that can be swapped to balance the total value.

5. **Final allocation:**

    After considering these factors and ensuring a balanced approach, the allocation is as follows:

    - Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 5, 7
    - Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 4, 6

6. **Total valuation for each agent after allocation:**

    - Agent 0: 42 (item 0) + 87 (item 3) + 34 (item 5) + 91 (item 7) = 254
    - Agent 1: 14 (item 1) + 74 (item 2) + 91 (item 4) + 49 (item 6) = 192

The allocation is reasonably balanced in terms of total value each agent receives, and it is achieved with the following JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of their perceived value, minimizing envy between them.
