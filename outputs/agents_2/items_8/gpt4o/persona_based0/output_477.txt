Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  33  21  14  20  39  92  38
1  67  22  12  34  33  97  45   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 8 items between the 2 agents such that the allocation is envy-free, meaning that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation based on their valuations.

We can determine the allocation using a fair division approach called the "Envy-Free Item Allocation." We'll aim to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, subject to the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 14     | 33     | 21     | 14     | 20     | 39     | 92     | 38     |
| 1     | 67     | 22     | 12     | 34     | 33     | 97     | 45     | 4      |

Let's calculate and propose the allocation.

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items:**  
   - Item 6 (92)
   - Item 5 (39)
   - Item 7 (38)

2. **Agent 1's highest valued items:**
   - Item 5 (97)
   - Item 0 (67)
   - Item 3 (34)

We can propose an allocation as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items: 6, 7, 2, 1
- Agent 1 receives items: 5, 0, 3, 4

Now, let's check if this allocation is envy-free:

- **Agent 0's Allocation Value:** 92 (Item 6) + 38 (Item 7) + 21 (Item 2) + 33 (Item 1) = 184
- **Agent 1's Allocation Value:** 97 (Item 5) + 67 (Item 0) + 34 (Item 3) + 33 (Item 4) = 231

**Envy Check:**

- Does Agent 0 envy Agent 1?  
  Agent 0's valuation of Agent 1's items: 39 (Item 5) + 14 (Item 0) + 14 (Item 3) + 20 (Item 4) = 87  
  Since 184 > 87, Agent 0 does not envy Agent 1.

- Does Agent 1 envy Agent 0?  
  Agent 1's valuation of Agent 0's items: 45 (Item 6) + 4 (Item 7) + 12 (Item 2) + 22 (Item 1) = 83  
  Since 231 > 83, Agent 1 does not envy Agent 0.

Both agents prefer their own allocations, so the allocation is envy-free.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 2, 1],
    "1": [5, 0, 3, 4]
}
```
