Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  43  37  61  21  85   0  31
1  32  25  50  16  94  18  49  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between two agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness ensures that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their own valuation.

First, let's compute the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- **Agent 0's total valuation**: 30 + 43 + 37 + 61 + 21 + 85 + 0 + 31 = 308
- **Agent 1's total valuation**: 32 + 25 + 50 + 16 + 94 + 18 + 49 + 86 = 370

To achieve a fair division, we aim to assign items such that each agent receives a bundle of items they value at least as much as the other agent would value their bundle.

Let's proceed by assigning items based on maximizing each agent's valuation for their bundle while ensuring the other agent does not envy.

1. **Assign items to Agent 0:**
   - Items 5 (85) and 3 (61) have the highest values for Agent 0. Assign these first.
   - Check remaining high-value items for Agent 0: Item 2 (37), Item 1 (43).
   - Assign items to maximize values without causing envy for Agent 1.

2. **Assign items to Agent 1:**
   - Items 4 (94) and 7 (86) have the highest values for Agent 1. Assign these first.
   - Check remaining high-value items for Agent 1: Item 6 (49), Item 2 (50).
   - Assign items to maximize values without causing envy for Agent 0.

Considering both agents' valuations and aiming for balance, the allocation could be:

- Assign items 0, 2, 3, and 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 4, 6, and 7 to Agent 1.

Let's verify:

- **Agent 0's received items valuation**: 30 (Item 0) + 37 (Item 2) + 61 (Item 3) + 85 (Item 5) = 213
- **Agent 1's received items valuation**: 25 (Item 1) + 94 (Item 4) + 49 (Item 6) + 86 (Item 7) = 254

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and the total valuations are reasonably balanced.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
