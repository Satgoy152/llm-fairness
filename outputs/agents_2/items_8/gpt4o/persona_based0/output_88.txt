Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  94  94  66  66  71  28  62
1  18  31  25  74  69  54  84  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will follow a systematic approach. We want to distribute the items such that no agent feels they would prefer the other agent's allocation over their own, considering their individual valuations.

First, let's sum up the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 42 + 94 + 94 + 66 + 66 + 71 + 28 + 62 = 523
- Agent 1: 18 + 31 + 25 + 74 + 69 + 54 + 84 + 98 = 453

Next, we can rank the items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents. This will help us identify items that are strongly preferred by one agent over the other.

Calculating the difference (Agent 0's valuation - Agent 1's valuation):

- Item 0: 42 - 18 = 24
- Item 1: 94 - 31 = 63
- Item 2: 94 - 25 = 69
- Item 3: 66 - 74 = -8
- Item 4: 66 - 69 = -3
- Item 5: 71 - 54 = 17
- Item 6: 28 - 84 = -56
- Item 7: 62 - 98 = -36

Now, let's allocate the items based on these differences:

1. Items that Agent 0 strongly values more than Agent 1: 2, 1, 0, 5
2. Items that Agent 1 strongly values more than Agent 0: 6, 7, 3, 4

Allocating:

- Give Agent 0 the items they value significantly higher: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Give Agent 1 the items they value significantly higher: 3, 4, 6, 7

Re-checking the valuation sums:

- Agent 0: 42 + 94 + 94 + 71 = 301
- Agent 1: 74 + 69 + 84 + 98 = 325

Both agents receive items that they value highly, aiming for envy-freeness.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
