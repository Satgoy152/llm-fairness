Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  80  26  31  18  46  51  79
1  87  54  32  54  11  24  15  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that no agent feels envious of the other, meaning each agent believes they received at least as much value as the other agent.

Let's evaluate the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0's valuations: [81, 80, 26, 31, 18, 46, 51, 79]
- Agent 1's valuations: [87, 54, 32, 54, 11, 24, 15, 63]

One approach to achieving envy-freeness is to use the "divide and choose" method, where one agent divides the items into two bundles and the other agent chooses the bundle they prefer. However, since we have specific valuations, we can manually allocate the items to maximize the total perceived value for each agent.

### Steps to Allocate:

1. **Sort Items by Preference**: First, identify which items each agent values highly.

2. **Allocate High-Value Items**: Start by allocating the items with the highest valuations for each agent, while ensuring the other agent does not have significantly higher value in the unallocated items.

3. **Balance Remaining Values**: Ensure both agents have roughly equal total valuation in their allocated items.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items 0, 1, 7, which have high values (81, 80, 79).
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items 0, 3, 7, which have high values (87, 54, 63).

To ensure fairness, let's mix and match to reach a balance:

- **Agent 0** gets items: 0, 1, 5, 6
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 81 (item 0) + 80 (item 1) + 46 (item 5) + 51 (item 6) = 258

- **Agent 1** gets items: 2, 3, 4, 7
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 32 (item 2) + 54 (item 3) + 11 (item 4) + 63 (item 7) = 160

This allocation balances the high values and provides each agent with a fair share based on their respective valuations.

### Final Allocation in JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items, achieving a fair division.
