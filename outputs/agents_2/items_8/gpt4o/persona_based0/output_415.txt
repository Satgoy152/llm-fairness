Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  14  51  68  37  13  91  81
1  45  95  33  72  16  83  24  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim for envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own bundle. Here, we will try to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**  
   - Agent 0: Total value of all items = 14 + 14 + 51 + 68 + 37 + 13 + 91 + 81 = 369
   - Agent 1: Total value of all items = 45 + 95 + 33 + 72 + 16 + 83 + 24 + 81 = 449

2. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's highest-value items: 
     - Item 6 (91), Item 7 (81), Item 3 (68)
   - Agent 1's highest-value items:
     - Item 1 (95), Item 5 (83), Item 3 (72)

3. **Initial Allocation Based on High Valuation:**  
   Allocate items to each agent starting from their highest valued items until no conflicts arise or until all items are allocated.

4. **Resolve Conflicts:**  
   - Both agents highly value Item 3. We should consider reallocating it to balance the total value perceived by each agent.
   - Tentative allocation to Agent 1: Item 1 and Item 5, and Item 3 due to their high valuation.
   - Allocate other high-value items to Agent 0: Item 6 and Item 7.

5. **Allocate Remaining Items to Balance Total Value:**
   - Agent 0: Item 0, Item 2, Item 4
   - Agent 1: Item 3

6. **Calculate Total Value of Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Items allocated = 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
     - Total Value = 14 + 51 + 37 + 91 + 81 = 274
   - Agent 1: Items allocated = 1, 3, 5
     - Total Value = 95 + 72 + 83 = 250

This allocation results in a close total valuation for both agents, which should help in achieving fairness and envy-freeness.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of the total value based on their individual valuations, minimizing envy and maintaining fairness.
