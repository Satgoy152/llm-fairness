Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  78  24  41  82  32  13  45
1   1  56  83  40  36  51  43  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free division. This means each agent should believe they have received at least as valuable a bundle as the other agent, based on their own valuations.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 85 + 78 + 24 + 41 + 82 + 32 + 13 + 45 = 400
- Agent 1: 1 + 56 + 83 + 40 + 36 + 51 + 43 + 96 = 406

Next, we'll try to allocate items to ensure both agents are satisfied with what they receive. We can use the approach of maximizing each agent's share relative to their total value of all items.

Here are the steps we'll take:

1. Assign items to agents based on the highest relative value each agent assigns to the items.

2. Make sure each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

3. Check for envy-freeness: Each agent should not prefer the other agent's bundle over their own.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 (85) highly, so we allocate it to them.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 (83) highly, so we allocate it to them.
3. Agent 1 also values item 7 (96) highly, so we allocate it to them.
4. Agent 0 values item 1 (78) highly, so we allocate it to them.
5. Agent 0 values item 4 (82) highly, so we allocate it to them.
6. Agent 1 values item 5 (51) highly, so we allocate it to them.
7. Agent 0 values item 3 (41) highly, so we allocate it to them.
8. Agent 1 values item 6 (43) highly, so we allocate it to them.

Now, let's compile this allocation into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive four items each, and the distribution considers their valuations to minimize envy.
