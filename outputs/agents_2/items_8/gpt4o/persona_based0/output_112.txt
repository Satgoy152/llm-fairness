Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  76  92   3  51  13  37  69
1  63   8  26  24  90  81  14  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim for an allocation that is envy-free and efficient. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the items allocated to the other agent over their own allocation. An efficient allocation ensures that the total value obtained from the allocation is maximized.

Let's look at the total valuations each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(2 + 76 + 92 + 3 + 51 + 13 + 37 + 69 = 343\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(63 + 8 + 26 + 24 + 90 + 81 + 14 + 92 = 398\)

To attempt an envy-free and efficient allocation, we might start by allocating items based on each agent's highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share.

Agent 0's highest-valued items:
1. Item 2 (92)
2. Item 1 (76)
3. Item 7 (69)

Agent 1's highest-valued items:
1. Item 7 (92)
2. Item 4 (90)
3. Item 5 (81)

Now, let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Allocate item 7 to Agent 1:** Highest value for Agent 1.
2. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0:** Highest value for Agent 0.
3. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 1:** High value for Agent 1.
4. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0:** High value for Agent 0.
5. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 1:** High value for Agent 1.
6. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 1:** High value for Agent 1.
7. **Allocate item 6 to Agent 0:** High value for Agent 0.
8. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 0:** Remaining item for Agent 0.

Now let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 has items: 2, 1, 6, and 3
- Agent 1 has items: 7, 4, 5, and 0

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items closer to their highest valuations, while also keeping the distribution balanced.

Here is the json representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 6, 3],
    "1": [7, 4, 5, 0]
}
```
