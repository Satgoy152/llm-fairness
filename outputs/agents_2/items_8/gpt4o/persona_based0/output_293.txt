Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  74  16  40   1  21  75  97
1  95  10  51  53  12  89  70  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, ideally minimizing envy.

Let's calculate the total value each agent perceives for all items:
- Agent 0 total value: 50 + 74 + 16 + 40 + 1 + 21 + 75 + 97 = 374
- Agent 1 total value: 95 + 10 + 51 + 53 + 12 + 89 + 70 + 48 = 428

To aim for approximate fairness, each agent should ideally receive half of the total value they perceive, which means:
- Agent 0 should aim for a value of about 187 (374 / 2)
- Agent 1 should aim for a value of about 214 (428 / 2)

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Assign high-value items based on preference**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 7 (97) and item 1 (74).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0 (95) and item 5 (89).

2. **Allocate these initially preferred items to each agent**:
   - Agent 0: Items 7 (97), 1 (74)
   - Agent 1: Items 0 (95), 5 (89)

3. **Continue allocating remaining items to achieve balance**:

   Remaining items are 2, 3, 4, and 6. Evaluate based on total values needed to reach the approximate fair share.

   - Agent 0's current total: 97 + 74 = 171
   - Agent 1's current total: 95 + 89 = 184

   Agent 0 needs an additional value of about 16 to reach 187, while Agent 1 needs an additional value of about 30 to reach 214.

4. **Continue allocation**:
   - Agent 0 values item 6 at 75, which would overshoot their target, but they could take item 2 (16) and item 4 (1) to reach 188.
   - Agent 1 could take item 6 (70), which gets them to 254, but they've already received high-value items, so they can take items 3 (53) and the remaining item 4 (12) to get closer to their goal.

5. **Final allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 7 (97), 1 (74), 2 (16), 4 (1)
   - Agent 1: Items 0 (95), 5 (89), 3 (53), 6 (70)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 5, 3, 6]
}
```
