Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  52  61  37   8  54  59  40
1  26  65   4  95  41   4   5  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents such that the distribution is envy-free, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction given their valuations.

Let's start by evaluating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 87 + 52 + 61 + 37 + 8 + 54 + 59 + 40 = 398
- Agent 1's total valuation: 26 + 65 + 4 + 95 + 41 + 4 + 5 + 58 = 298

Now, let's consider a fair division approach. We will start by assigning the items based on each agent's highest valuations, while ensuring that the distribution remains balanced in terms of total value.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify crucial items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 87.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 95.

2. **Assign the highest valued items to each agent:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Reassess remaining items to balance allocations:**
   - Remaining items: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.

4. **Allocate items to equalize perceived value:**
   - Next highest for Agent 0: item 2 (61), item 5 (54)
   - Next highest for Agent 1: item 1 (65), item 7 (58)

5. **Distribute remaining items:**
   - Assign item 2 and item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 and item 7 to Agent 1.

6. **Balance the remaining items:**
   - Items left: 4, 6.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (41 vs 8).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (59 vs 5).

### Allocation Summary:
By following this procedure, we ensure each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their perceived value while ensuring fairness.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, 5, and 6, while Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, 4, and 7. This allocation balances the total valuation each agent derives from their assigned items and aims to maintain envy-freeness.
