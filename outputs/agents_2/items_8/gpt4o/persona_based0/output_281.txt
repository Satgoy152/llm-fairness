Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  58  37  48  79   5  29  97
1  37  29  98  46   2  82  54  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that aims for envy-freeness, we should consider the values each agent assigns to each item and attempt to allocate items such that no agent envies the other's allocation. This involves considering both the total value of items allocated to each agent and the individual values agents assign to these items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 35 + 58 + 37 + 48 + 79 + 5 + 29 + 97 = 388
- Agent 1's total value: 37 + 29 + 98 + 46 + 2 + 82 + 54 + 13 = 361

Next, we'll try to allocate items such that the perceived value for each agent is as close as possible, maintaining integer allocations.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: 
   - For Agent 0, items with high values are: 7 (97) and 4 (79).
   - For Agent 1, items with high values are: 2 (98) and 5 (82).

2. **Balance Total Values**:
   - Allocate high-value items to each agent to balance out the total perceived value for both.

### Proposed Allocation
- **Agent 0**: Allocate items that maximize their value but ensure balance. Assign items: 7 (97), 4 (79), 3 (48), 0 (35).
  - Total value for Agent 0: 97 + 79 + 48 + 35 = 259

- **Agent 1**: Allocate items that maximize their value and ensure balance. Assign items: 2 (98), 5 (82), 1 (29), 6 (54).
  - Total value for Agent 1: 98 + 82 + 29 + 54 = 263

Both agents have a close perceived total value, aiming for an envy-free allocation.

### Allocation in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.
