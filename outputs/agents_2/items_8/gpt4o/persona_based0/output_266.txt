Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  7  72  53  47  87  55  24  80
1  5  45  71  80   0  19  39  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we need to consider the preferences of each agent and try to allocate items such that no agent believes another agent has a better allocation. In this case, we have two agents (0 and 1) and eight items. Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items in a way that is as fair as possible.

### Agent Valuations:

- **Agent 0's valuations**: [7, 72, 53, 47, 87, 55, 24, 80]
- **Agent 1's valuations**: [5, 45, 71, 80, 0, 19, 39, 65]

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Allocate high-value items**: Start by allocating the highest-valued items for each agent when they strongly prefer them over the other agent.

2. **Balance remaining items**: Distribute the remaining items by considering the next highest values while keeping track of the total valuation each agent receives.

Following this strategy:

- **Agent 0** has a high valuation for items 4 (87) and 1 (72).
- **Agent 1** highly values items 3 (80) and 2 (71).

Let's allocate these items first:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

Now, we have allocated 4 items, and 4 items remain. Let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0** values item 7 (80) highly compared to Agent 1 who values it at 65.
- **Agent 1** has a preference for item 6 (39) over Agent 0 who values it at 24.
- **Agent 0** can take item 5 (55) as it is valued higher than by Agent 1 (19).
- **Agent 0** also values item 0 (7) more than Agent 1 (5).

Allocate these items:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

This allocation ensures that each agent has an integer number of items and aims to balance the total valuation received by each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Items [4, 1, 7, 5, 0]
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 2, 6]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 7, 5, 0],
    "1": [3, 2, 6]
}
```
