Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6   7
0  57  14  58  37  67  58  8  33
1  45  55  29  66  20  92  3  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim for a distribution where each agent values their allocation at least as much as the other agent's allocation. We can use a simple allocation strategy based on maximizing each agent's total valuation for their received items.

Let's calculate the total valuations for some possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 57
   - Item 1: 14
   - Item 2: 58
   - Item 3: 37
   - Item 4: 67
   - Item 5: 58
   - Item 6: 8
   - Item 7: 33

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 45
   - Item 1: 55
   - Item 2: 29
   - Item 3: 66
   - Item 4: 20
   - Item 5: 92
   - Item 6: 3
   - Item 7: 57

### Step 1: Rank Items by Valuation Difference
To make a fair allocation, we can calculate the absolute difference between the valuations of the two agents for each item and assign items with the highest difference in valuation to the agent who values them more.

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value | Difference | Most Valued By |
|------|---------------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| 0    | 57            | 45            | 12         | Agent 0        |
| 1    | 14            | 55            | 41         | Agent 1        |
| 2    | 58            | 29            | 29         | Agent 0        |
| 3    | 37            | 66            | 29         | Agent 1        |
| 4    | 67            | 20            | 47         | Agent 0        |
| 5    | 58            | 92            | 34         | Agent 1        |
| 6    | 8             | 3             | 5          | Agent 0        |
| 7    | 33            | 57            | 24         | Agent 1        |

### Step 2: Allocate Items Based on Highest Difference
1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (highest difference, Agent 0 values more).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (next highest difference, Agent 1 values more).
3. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
4. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
5. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
6. Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
7. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
8. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 5, 7

The total number of items allocated to each agent is equal, and the allocation is envy-free because each agent receives items they value highly.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
