Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11   8  94  44  12  45  25  41
1  17  91  30  92  59  66  75  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution. This means each agent should feel they received a fair share based on their valuation of the items.

### Valuations Table
```
| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   11   |   8    |   94   |   44   |   12   |   45   |   25   |   41   |
|   1   |   17   |   91   |   30   |   92   |   59   |   66   |   75   |   20   |
```

### Approach
1. **Maximize Total Value for Each Agent:** Allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent while keeping the distribution envy-free.
2. **Balance Item Count:** Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, with a total of 8 items allocated.
3. **Evaluate Potential Allocations:** Consider different potential allocations and their resulting envy levels.

### Allocation Strategy
- **Agent 0:** Highly values Item 2 and Item 5.
- **Agent 1:** Highly values Item 1 and Item 3.

### Proposed Allocation
- **Agent 0:** Items [2, 5, 0, 7]
- **Agent 1:** Items [1, 3, 4, 6]

This allocation aims to maximize the value for each agent based on their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.

### JSON Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 0, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation provides Agent 0 with items they value highly (such as Item 2 and Item 5), and Agent 1 with items they value highly (such as Item 1 and Item 3), ensuring an envy-free allocation.
