Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  83  53  87  81  35   0  30
1   3  59  99  29  49  57  15  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we want to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share, based on their valuations. 

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**  
   - Agent 0: 67 + 83 + 53 + 87 + 81 + 35 + 0 + 30 = 436
   - Agent 1: 3 + 59 + 99 + 29 + 49 + 57 + 15 + 85 = 396

2. **Determine a Fair Share for Each Agent:**  
   Since there are 8 items, each agent should ideally get approximately 4 items, considering their valuations.

3. **Choose Items for Each Agent to Maximize Their Value Without Causing Envy:**

   Let's start by choosing items that maximize each agent's value, ensuring that the other agent doesn't have a significantly higher valuation for those items.

   **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (87) and item 4 (81).
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (99) and item 7 (85).

   Let's assign these items initially:

   - Agent 0: Items 3 and 4
   - Agent 1: Items 2 and 7

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**

   Now we have remaining items: 0, 1, 5, 6. Allocate in a way that balances their valuations:

   - Agent 0 values item 0 (67) more than agent 1 values any of the remaining items.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 (59) more than agent 0 values it.

   Assign these items:

   - Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 7

5. **Allocate Remaining Items:**

   The remaining items are 5 and 6. 

   - Agent 0 values item 5 (35) more than agent 1 (57).
   - Agent 1 values item 6 (15) more than agent 0 (0).

   Therefore, assign:

   - Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4, 5
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 6, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their individual valuation while minimizing potential envy.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 6, 7]
}
```
