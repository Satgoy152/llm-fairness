Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  66  86  11  58  50  38  40
1  39  48  76  77  49  86  46  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [39 48 76 77 49 86 46 92]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method that considers both agents' valuations. One approach is to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring that each agent perceives their allocation as fair or at least not envious of the other's allocation.

The given valuation matrix is:

```
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
Agent 0: 51, 66, 86, 11, 58, 50, 38, 40
Agent 1: 39, 48, 76, 77, 49, 86, 46, 92
```

To address this problem, a potential strategy is to allocate items such that each agent receives items with the highest valuation difference in their favor. We can follow this strategy:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Allocate items based on maximizing each agent's perceived value while minimizing envy.

Let's calculate the difference:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 at 39. Difference = 12 (in favor of Agent 0)
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 at 48. Difference = 18 (in favor of Agent 0)
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 at 76. Difference = 10 (in favor of Agent 0)
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 11, Agent 1 at 77. Difference = -66 (in favor of Agent 1)
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 at 49. Difference = 9 (in favor of Agent 0)
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 at 86. Difference = -36 (in favor of Agent 1)
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 38, Agent 1 at 46. Difference = -8 (in favor of Agent 1)
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 at 92. Difference = -52 (in favor of Agent 1)

Now, let's allocate the items based on the differences:

- Agent 0: Items with positive differences (0, 1, 2, 4)
- Agent 1: Items with negative differences (3, 5, 6, 7)

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value more compared to the other agent's valuation.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation respects the given constraints and aims to minimize envy by considering the valuation differences between the agents.
