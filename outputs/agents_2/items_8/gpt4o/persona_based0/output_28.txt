Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  79  39  72  56   9  54  43
1  27  13  55  64  68  94  65  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that neither agent prefers the other's allocation over their own.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent has for all items and then attempt to balance the allocations to ensure fairness:

Agent 0's total valuation of all items:  
57 + 79 + 39 + 72 + 56 + 9 + 54 + 43 = 409

Agent 1's total valuation of all items:  
27 + 13 + 55 + 64 + 68 + 94 + 65 + 14 = 400

Next, we'll try to allocate items to minimize envy by balancing the total valuation of items received by each agent:

1. **Highest Valued Items for Each Agent:**  
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (79).
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (94).

2. **Allocate High-Value Items First:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 and item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Continue Allocating to Balance Valuation:**
   - Agent 0: 79 (Item 1)
   - Agent 1: 94 (Item 5)

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**

   - Consider other high-value items for each agent and alternate to maintain balance:
     - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 64 for Agent 1).
     - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 57 for Agent 0).
     - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 68 for Agent 1).
     - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value 54 for Agent 0).
     - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 55 for Agent 1).
     - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (value 43 for Agent 0).

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 0, 6, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 5, 3, 4, 2

**Valuations After Allocation:**

- Agent 0's total valuation: 79 + 57 + 54 + 43 = 233
- Agent 1's total valuation: 94 + 64 + 68 + 55 = 281

While not perfectly equal, the allocation attempts to balance the high-value preferences of each agent. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 6, 7],
    "1": [5, 3, 4, 2]
}
```
