Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  26  96  70  37  20  18  63
1  77  80  55  19  83  85  35   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[68 26 96 70 37 20 18 63]
 [77 80 55 19 83 85 35  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

Let's summarize the agents' valuations for the items:

- Agent 0's valuations: [68, 26, 96, 70, 37, 20, 18, 63]
- Agent 1's valuations: [77, 80, 55, 19, 83, 85, 35, 2]

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 2 (96) and item 3 (70).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 5 (85) and item 4 (83).

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).

3. **Allocate Remaining High-Valuation Items:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1).

4. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0: Assign items 0 (68) and 7 (63).
   - Agent 1: Assign items 1 (80) and 6 (35).

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 3, 0, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 5, 4, 1, 6

This allocation respects the high-valuations of both agents and aims to minimize envy. Both agents receive items that they highly value, and the total number of items allocated is eight.

### JSON Representation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 0, 7],
    "1": [5, 4, 1, 6]
}
```
