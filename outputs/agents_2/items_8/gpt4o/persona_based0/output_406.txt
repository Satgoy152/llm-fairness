Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  93  61  23  40  99  78  20
1  66  89  47  84  87  18   1  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we want to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We'll use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives to guide our allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's values: [81, 93, 61, 23, 40, 99, 78, 20]
- Agent 1's values: [66, 89, 47, 84, 87, 18, 1, 55]

A potential approach is to maximize the sum of values for each agent while ensuring the distribution is as balanced as possible. A simple algorithm that can be applied here is to assign items iteratively to the agent who values them the most, which might not always lead to an envy-free allocation but can be a starting point for balancing.

Let's assign the items:

1. Item 5 (value 99 for Agent 0 and 18 for Agent 1) is best valued by Agent 0.
2. Item 3 (value 23 for Agent 0 and 84 for Agent 1) is best valued by Agent 1.
3. Item 4 (value 40 for Agent 0 and 87 for Agent 1) is best valued by Agent 1.
4. Item 1 (value 93 for Agent 0 and 89 for Agent 1) is best valued by Agent 0.
5. Item 0 (value 81 for Agent 0 and 66 for Agent 1) is best valued by Agent 0.
6. Item 6 (value 78 for Agent 0 and 1 for Agent 1) is best valued by Agent 0.
7. Item 2 (value 61 for Agent 0 and 47 for Agent 1) is best valued by Agent 0.
8. Item 7 (value 20 for Agent 0 and 55 for Agent 1) is best valued by Agent 1.

The allocation based on the above reasoning would be:

- Agent 0 receives items: 5, 1, 0, 6, 2
- Agent 1 receives items: 3, 4, 7

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 99 + 93 + 81 + 78 + 61 = 412 and Agent 1 a total value of 84 + 87 + 55 = 226.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 0, 6, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 7]
}
```
