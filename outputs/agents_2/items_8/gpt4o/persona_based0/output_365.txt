Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  90  91  73  85  10  13  23
1  37  42  90  68  90  79  80  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [37 42 90 68 90 79 80 61]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents while minimizing envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value that each agent receives. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that both agents feel they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

1. **List the Items with Their Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [9, 90, 91, 73, 85, 10, 13, 23]
   - Agent 1: [37, 42, 90, 68, 90, 79, 80, 61]

2. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: 9 + 37 = 46
   - Item 1: 90 + 42 = 132
   - Item 2: 91 + 90 = 181
   - Item 3: 73 + 68 = 141
   - Item 4: 85 + 90 = 175
   - Item 5: 10 + 79 = 89
   - Item 6: 13 + 80 = 93
   - Item 7: 23 + 61 = 84

3. **Sort Items by Total Valuation:**
   - [Item 2, Item 4, Item 3, Item 1, Item 6, Item 5, Item 7, Item 0]

4. **Allocate Items to Agents Based on Highest Individual Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 values more: Item 0, Item 1, Item 2, Item 3, Item 4
   - Agent 1 values more: Item 5, Item 6, Item 7

5. **Reassign Items for Balance:**
   - Agent 0 should receive 4 items and Agent 1 should receive 4 items.

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Assign items to balance the load and ensure each agent receives items they value highly without causing envy.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 3, and 4 with valuations [9, 90, 73, 85] respectively.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 5, 6, and 7 with valuations [90, 79, 80, 61] respectively.

This distribution aims to balance the total value each agent perceives and minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they value more highly.
