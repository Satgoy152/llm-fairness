Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  95  88   8  76  96  97  14
1  23   5  66  32  57  25  34  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [23  5 66 32 57 25 34 84]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means we want each agent to feel that their allocation is at least as good as what they could get by swapping with the other agent.

Let's summarize the agents' valuations for the items:

- Agent 0's valuations: [48, 95, 88, 8, 76, 96, 97, 14]
- Agent 1's valuations: [23, 5, 66, 32, 57, 25, 34, 84]

We'll use a simple approach to maximize each agent's total value while trying to avoid envy:

1. Sort the items by value for each agent.
2. Alternately assign the most valued available item to each agent, starting with the agent who has the highest single-item valuation.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the most (97), so assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 the most (84), so assign item 7 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 0's next highest value is item 5 (96), so assign item 5 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 1's next highest value is item 2 (66), so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
5. Agent 0's next highest value is item 1 (95), so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
6. Agent 1's next highest value is item 4 (57), so assign item 4 to Agent 1.
7. Agent 0's next highest value is item 0 (48), so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
8. The only item left is item 3, assign it to Agent 1.

After this allocation, we should ensure that the allocation is at least close to envy-free if not perfectly. In many cases, this approach balances the total values received by each agent.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 1, 0],
    "1": [7, 2, 4, 3]
}
```
