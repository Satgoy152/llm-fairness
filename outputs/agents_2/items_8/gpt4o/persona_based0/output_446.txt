Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  45  73  63  87  26  10  99
1  53  17  83  97  21  53  18  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the items in a way that is as fair as possible, considering each agent's valuation of each item. A common concept in fair division is envy-freeness, meaning that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. Although achieving perfect envy-freeness is often challenging, we strive to minimize envy given the constraints.

The valuations for the two agents are:

- Agent 0: [6, 45, 73, 63, 87, 26, 10, 99]
- Agent 1: [53, 17, 83, 97, 21, 53, 18, 23]

We will try to allocate the items so that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

### Steps to Allocate Items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**:
   - Sum of valuations for Agent 0: \(6 + 45 + 73 + 63 + 87 + 26 + 10 + 99 = 409\)
   - Sum of valuations for Agent 1: \(53 + 17 + 83 + 97 + 21 + 53 + 18 + 23 = 365\)

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by allocating items where one agent has a significantly higher valuation than the other.
   - For example, item 7 is highly valued by Agent 0 (99 vs. 23 for Agent 1), so allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
   - Item 3 is highly valued by Agent 1 (97 vs. 63 for Agent 0), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Continue Allocation by Balancing Total Values**:
   - Allocate items to balance the total valuation each agent receives, taking into account both the number of items and the total valuation.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - After analyzing and balancing the total valuations, the allocation could look like this:

### Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 3, 5

This allocation gives:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: \(73 + 87 + 10 + 99 = 269\)
- Total valuation for Agent 1: \(6 + 45 + 97 + 53 = 201\)

While the total valuation isn't perfectly balanced, this allocation reduces envy by ensuring each agent receives items that contribute significantly to their valuation, given the constraints.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 5]
}
```
