Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  49  71  95  52  46  33  18
1  42  73  39  12  12  86  89  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 73 39 12 12 86 89 73]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of the other agent, according to their valuations.

Looking at the valuation matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 66     | 49     | 71     | 95     | 52     | 46     | 33     | 18     |
| 1     | 42     | 73     | 39     | 12     | 12     | 86     | 89     | 73     |

We can start by looking at the items that have the highest difference in valuations between agents, and allocate those to the agent who values them more. This will help in minimizing envy.

1. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 at 12. Difference = 83. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 89, Agent 0 at 33. Difference = 56. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 at 42. Difference = 24. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 86, Agent 0 at 46. Difference = 40. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 at 39. Difference = 32. Allocate to Agent 0.
6. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 73, Agent 0 at 49. Difference = 24. Allocate to Agent 1.
7. Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 73, Agent 0 at 18. Difference = 55. Allocate to Agent 1.
8. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 52, Agent 1 at 12. Difference = 40. Allocate to Agent 0.

Now let's check the allocations and total valuations:

For Agent 0:
- Items: 0, 3, 2, 4
- Total Value: 66 + 95 + 71 + 52 = 284

For Agent 1:
- Items: 6, 5, 1, 7
- Total Value: 89 + 86 + 73 + 73 = 321

While the allocation is not perfectly equal in terms of total valuation, it minimizes envy based on the items' valuations.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 2, 4],
    "1": [6, 5, 1, 7]
}
```
