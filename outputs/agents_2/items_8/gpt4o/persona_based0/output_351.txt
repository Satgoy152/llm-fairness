Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  20  29  73   3  99  84  38
1  36  54  55  95  95  81  35  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation across all items: \(1 + 20 + 29 + 73 + 3 + 99 + 84 + 38 = 347\).
   - Agent 1's total valuation across all items: \(36 + 54 + 55 + 95 + 95 + 81 + 35 + 26 = 477\).

2. **Determine Envy-Free Allocations:**
   - We aim for each agent to receive a set of items such that they value their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent.

3. **Allocate Items Based on Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 5 and 6 (99 and 84), so giving them these items is a good start.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 3 and 4 (95 each), so allocating these to Agent 1 would be fair.

4. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Evaluate the remaining items' valuations to ensure balanced and fair allocations.

**Allocation:**

- Assign items 5 and 6 to Agent 0 since they have a high valuation for these.
- Assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 1 due to their high valuation.
- For the remaining items, allocate in a way that balances the total valuation for each agent:
  - Give item 0 (valued at 1 by Agent 0 and 36 by Agent 1) to Agent 1.
  - Give item 1 (valued at 20 by Agent 0 and 54 by Agent 1) to Agent 1.
  - Give item 2 (valued at 29 by Agent 0 and 55 by Agent 1) to Agent 0.
  - Give item 7 (valued at 38 by Agent 0 and 26 by Agent 1) to Agent 0.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share according to their valuations, and all items are allocated.
