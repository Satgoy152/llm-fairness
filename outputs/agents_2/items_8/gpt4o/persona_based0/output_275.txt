Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6  7
0  61  16  80  41  16   0  26  8
1  75  15  27  64  20  52  62  1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(61 + 16 + 80 + 41 + 16 + 0 + 26 + 8 = 248\)
- Agent 1: \(75 + 15 + 27 + 64 + 20 + 52 + 62 + 1 = 316\)

Next, we need to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair proportion of their overall valuation.

### Steps for Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Check which items have a significantly higher value for one agent compared to the other. These are candidates for allocation to the agent who values them more.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign items to maximize each agent's perceived value while keeping the total number of items balanced (4 items each).

3. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 highly (80), and Agent 1 values item 0 highly (75). 
   - Agent 1 also values items 5 (52) and 6 (62) significantly higher than Agent 0.
   - Conversely, Agent 0 values item 3 (41) more than Agent 1.

4. **Proposed Allocation**:
   - Assign items with the greatest difference in valuation to the agent who values them more.
   - Ensure each agent gets 4 items to maintain balance.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 3, 4, 7
  - Values: 80 (2), 41 (3), 16 (4), 8 (7) = 145

- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 1, 5, 6
  - Values: 75 (0), 15 (1), 52 (5), 62 (6) = 204

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations and has an equal number of items. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 6]
}
```
