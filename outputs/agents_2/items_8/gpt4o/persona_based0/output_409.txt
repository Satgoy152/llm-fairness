Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  12  94  10  18  73  92  74
1  62  17  78  24   2  18  96  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. This means each agent should feel they received at least as much value as the other agent from their perspective. Below is an allocation strategy that aims to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their preference strength.
2. Allocate items to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their individual valuations.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation of each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 99 + 12 + 94 + 10 + 18 + 73 + 92 + 74 = 472
- Agent 1's total valuation: 62 + 17 + 78 + 24 + 2 + 18 + 96 + 17 = 314

Given these total valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that the perceived value for each agent is balanced according to their valuations.

Let's assign the items:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0, 2, 6, and 7.
- Agent 1 highly values items 6 and 2.

To achieve a balanced distribution, we can make the following assignment:

- Assign items 0, 2, 5, and 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 3, 4, and 6 to Agent 1.

This allocation considers the higher valuation items for each agent and tries to balance the overall perceived value from each agent's perspective.

The allocations in the specified JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
