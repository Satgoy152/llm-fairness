Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  90  16  85  59  77  61  34
1  44  23  44  18  77  38  87  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that the division is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own bundle, considering their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [5, 90, 16, 85, 59, 77, 61, 34]
- Agent 1's valuations: [44, 23, 44, 18, 77, 38, 87, 23]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a simple heuristic: assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This method doesn't guarantee envy-freeness, but it often results in a reasonable distribution of items.

1. Compare valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (44 vs. 5)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (90 vs. 23)
   - Item 2: Both value it equally (44 vs. 44), but we need to assign it to one agent. Let's assign it to Agent 1 based on the overall balance.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (85 vs. 18)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (77 vs. 59)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (77 vs. 38)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (87 vs. 61)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (34 vs. 23)

Now distribute the items based on these comparisons:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 2, 4, 6

This allocation gives both agents four items, and while it may not be perfectly envy-free, it ensures that each agent receives items they value highly.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
