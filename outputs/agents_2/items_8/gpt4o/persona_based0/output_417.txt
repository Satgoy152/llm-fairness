Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  12  60  84  62  85   5  53
1   6  44  35  27  24  87  18  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will aim to maximize the satisfaction for each agent given their valuations.

First, let's determine the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 24 + 12 + 60 + 84 + 62 + 85 + 5 + 53 = 385
- Agent 1's total valuation: 6 + 44 + 35 + 27 + 24 + 87 + 18 + 36 = 277

Now, let's consider the valuations for each item for both agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 24, Agent 1 values at 6
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 12, Agent 1 values at 44
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 60, Agent 1 values at 35
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 84, Agent 1 values at 27
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 62, Agent 1 values at 24
- Item 5: Agent 0 values at 85, Agent 1 values at 87
- Item 6: Agent 0 values at 5, Agent 1 values at 18
- Item 7: Agent 0 values at 53, Agent 1 values at 36

We need to allocate these items such that the perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

1. Start by allocating the items with the most significant value difference:
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values this item more (87 vs. 85), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values this item much more (84 vs. 27), allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values this item more (62 vs. 24), allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values this item more (60 vs. 35), allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values this item more (44 vs. 12), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values this item more (53 vs. 36), allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values this item more (18 vs. 5), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values this item more (24 vs. 6), allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 3, 4, 7] 
- Agent 1: [1, 5, 6]

Agent 0 has a total valuation of 24 + 60 + 84 + 62 + 53 = 283
Agent 1 has a total valuation of 44 + 87 + 18 = 149

The allocation is quite skewed. Let's attempt a better balance by re-evaluating the allocation:

To achieve a better balance, let's try reallocating:

- Item 5 (highest value for Agent 1) stays with Agent 1.
- Item 3 stays with Agent 0.
- Item 4 stays with Agent 0.
- Item 2 stays with Agent 0.
- Item 1 stays with Agent 1.
- Item 7 stays with Agent 0.
- Item 6 stays with Agent 1.
- Item 0 stays with Agent 0.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
