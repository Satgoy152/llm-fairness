Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39   2  87  57  15  19  46  41
1  26  36  82  64   6   0   6  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Let's start by calculating the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- **Agent 0**: 39 + 2 + 87 + 57 + 15 + 19 + 46 + 41 = 306
- **Agent 1**: 26 + 36 + 82 + 64 + 6 + 0 + 6 + 58 = 278

Next, we should attempt to divide the items such that the allocations are roughly proportional to the agents' total valuations.

**Step 1:** Sort items by the difference in valuations between agents.

\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
\text{Item} & \text{Agent 0 Valuation} & \text{Agent 1 Valuation} & \text{Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1)} \\
\hline
2 & 87 & 82 & 5 \\
3 & 57 & 64 & -7 \\
0 & 39 & 26 & 13 \\
7 & 41 & 58 & -17 \\
6 & 46 & 6 & 40 \\
1 & 2 & 36 & -34 \\
5 & 19 & 0 & 19 \\
4 & 15 & 6 & 9 \\
\end{array}
\]

**Step 2:** Allocate items to try to minimize envy. We will allocate items to agents such that each agent's bundle of items maximizes their own valuation while considering the difference.

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2, 6, 5 (valuations: 39 + 87 + 46 + 19 = 191)
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 3, 4, 7 (valuations: 36 + 64 + 6 + 58 = 164)

Both agents have received items that they value highly, and the allocation is balanced according to their preferences.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents have received a fair share of the total valuation, considering their preferences, and no agent envies the other's allocation given their own preferences.
