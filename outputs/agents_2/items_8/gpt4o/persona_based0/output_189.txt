Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  76  71  92  39  41  92  22
1  82  75  89  21  94  28  57  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer the bundle of items received by another agent, based on their valuations.

Let's start by computing the total valuation each agent places on all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 32 + 76 + 71 + 92 + 39 + 41 + 92 + 22 = 465
- Agent 1's total valuation: 82 + 75 + 89 + 21 + 94 + 28 + 57 + 51 = 497

Next, let's try to allocate items such that both agents have similar total valuations for their respective allocations, while also ensuring that the allocation is envy-free.

One potential approach is to allocate the items one by one to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that the total valuation for both agents remains balanced:

1. Item 3 (Agent 0: 92, Agent 1: 21) - Assign to Agent 0
2. Item 4 (Agent 0: 39, Agent 1: 94) - Assign to Agent 1
3. Item 2 (Agent 0: 71, Agent 1: 89) - Assign to Agent 1
4. Item 0 (Agent 0: 32, Agent 1: 82) - Assign to Agent 1
5. Item 6 (Agent 0: 92, Agent 1: 57) - Assign to Agent 0
6. Item 1 (Agent 0: 76, Agent 1: 75) - Assign to Agent 0
7. Item 5 (Agent 0: 41, Agent 1: 28) - Assign to Agent 0
8. Item 7 (Agent 0: 22, Agent 1: 51) - Assign to Agent 1

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items: 3, 6, 1, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 4, 2, 0, 7

Let's verify the total valuations:
- Agent 0: 92 (Item 3) + 92 (Item 6) + 76 (Item 1) + 41 (Item 5) = 301
- Agent 1: 94 (Item 4) + 89 (Item 2) + 82 (Item 0) + 51 (Item 7) = 316

This allocation is close in terms of total valuation and aims to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 1, 5],
    "1": [4, 2, 0, 7]
}
```
