Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9   7   1  51  11  27  61  63
1  36  89  89  22  77  15  46  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 9  7  1 51 11 27 61 63]
 [36 89 89 22 77 15 46 88]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy and maximize each agent's valuation of the items they receive. One common approach is to use the Envy-Free algorithm, which attempts to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Let's analyze the total valuations for each item per agent:

Agent 0's valuations: [9, 7, 1, 51, 11, 27, 61, 63]
Agent 1's valuations: [36, 89, 89, 22, 77, 15, 46, 88]

First, calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 9 + 7 + 1 + 51 + 11 + 27 + 61 + 63 = 230
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 36 + 89 + 89 + 22 + 77 + 15 + 46 + 88 = 462

Agent 1 has a significantly higher total valuation, suggesting they might have stronger preferences for certain items. Let's focus on maximizing the value each agent gets while keeping the allocation envy-free.

We can allocate items based on the highest valuations first, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of value.

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 89)
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 89)
3. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 88)
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 77)
5. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 61)
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 51)
7. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 27)
8. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 9)

Checking the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 3, 5, 6] with a total valuation of 9 + 51 + 27 + 61 = 148
- Agent 1 receives items: [1, 2, 4, 7] with a total valuation of 89 + 89 + 77 + 88 = 343

This allocation ensures both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations and minimizes envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 7]
}
```
