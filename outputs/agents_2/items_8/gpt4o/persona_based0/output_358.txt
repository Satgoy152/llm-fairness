Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  94  36  89  10  53  27  19
1  40  62  26  99  24  60  81  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, we should aim for an allocation that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring that neither agent envies the other (envy-freeness).

First, let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 90 + 94 + 36 + 89 + 10 + 53 + 27 + 19 = 418
- Agent 1's total valuation: 40 + 62 + 26 + 99 + 24 + 60 + 81 + 57 = 449

We aim to split the items such that each agent's total valuation from the items they receive is as balanced as possible.

Let's consider some possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0's Preference:**
   - High valued items for Agent 0: 0 (90), 1 (94), 3 (89)
   - Total valuation for these items = 273

2. **Agent 1's Preference:**
   - High valued items for Agent 1: 3 (99), 6 (81), 5 (60)
   - Total valuation for these items = 240

To achieve a fair allocation, we need to balance the remaining items such that both agents have a similar total valuation from their allocations.

Let's try the following allocation:

- Assign items based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring total valuations are balanced:

  - **Agent 0:** Items 0, 1, 4, 5
    - Total Valuation: 90 (item 0) + 94 (item 1) + 10 (item 4) + 53 (item 5) = 247

  - **Agent 1:** Items 2, 3, 6, 7
    - Total Valuation: 26 (item 2) + 99 (item 3) + 81 (item 6) + 57 (item 7) = 263

This allocation ensures a somewhat balanced valuation between the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
