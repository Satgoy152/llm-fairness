Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  45  44  80  25  48  88  84
1  87  88  18  71   5  55  78  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to find an allocation where each agent values their bundle highly and, ideally, no agent envies the other's allocation. This is known as envy-freeness. Given the constraints, it may not always be possible to achieve perfect envy-freeness, but we can aim to minimize dissatisfaction.

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuations for items 3, 6, and 7.
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuations for items 0, 1, and 5.

2. **Allocate high-value items:**
   - Allocate items 3, 6, and 7 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate items 0, 1, and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Remaining items are 2 and 4.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 44, which is higher than Agent 1â€™s valuation of 18. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Both agents value item 4 very lowly, but Agent 0 values it slightly higher (25 vs. 5). Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

Now let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 1, 5

Each agent ends up with a bundle of items such that no agent gets more than 5 items, and each agent gets at least 3 items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
