Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  34   6  28  49  27  28  49
1  17  78  83  65   1  24   0  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we aim for a division where neither agent envies the other's allocation. Envy-freeness is a key concept, ensuring each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as the other's based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: \(52 + 34 + 6 + 28 + 49 + 27 + 28 + 49 = 273\)
- Agent 1's total value: \(17 + 78 + 83 + 65 + 1 + 24 + 0 + 99 = 367\)

Next, let's try to allocate items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is as equal as possible.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 1's Top Valued Items**: Prioritize items where Agent 1 has a higher valuation compared to Agent 0.
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 99 (vs. 49 by Agent 0)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 83 (vs. 6 by Agent 0)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 78 (vs. 34 by Agent 0)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 65 (vs. 28 by Agent 0)
   
2. **Agent 0's Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items to Agent 0.
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 52
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 27
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 28

Now, let's calculate the perceived total values for each agent given this allocation:

- **Agent 0's Allocation**: Items 0, 4, 5, 6
  - Total value: \(52 + 49 + 27 + 28 = 156\)

- **Agent 1's Allocation**: Items 1, 2, 3, 7
  - Total value: \(78 + 83 + 65 + 99 = 325\)

This allocation is envy-free because:

- Agent 0's allocation is based on the items they value more relative to Agent 1.
- Agent 1's allocation covers their top preferences, maximizing their perceived value.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7]
}
```
