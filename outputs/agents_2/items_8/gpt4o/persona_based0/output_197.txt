Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6  7
0  61  94  50  41  67  46  31  2
1  51  95   4  69  44  68  79  1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy between the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's compute the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 61 + 94 + 50 + 41 + 67 + 46 + 31 + 2 = 392
- Agent 1 total valuation: 51 + 95 + 4 + 69 + 44 + 68 + 79 + 1 = 411

Since the total valuation from both agents is 803, each agent should ideally receive items totaling around half of this sum (i.e., 401.5) to be considered a perfectly fair division. However, since we can only allocate whole items and the total number of items is 8, we focus on assigning items in a way that minimizes envy and provides a fair distribution.

To achieve this, we'll use a simple approach to balance the distribution based on valuation:

1. **Assign the highest-valued items to the agent that values them most**.
2. **Ensure the number of items given to each agent is a whole number, and all items are distributed**.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 1 at 94, which is highly valued by both, but Agent 0 has slightly less total valuation.
- **Agent 1** values item 5 at 68, which is also highly valued, but Agent 1 has a higher total valuation and benefits more from other items.

Let's allocate such that the total value each agent receives is balanced:

- Agent 0: items 0, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Agent 1: items 1, 5, 6

This results in:

- Agent 0's valuation: 61 (item 0) + 50 (item 2) + 41 (item 3) + 67 (item 4) + 2 (item 7) = 221
- Agent 1's valuation: 95 (item 1) + 68 (item 5) + 79 (item 6) = 242

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

These allocations ensure that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations, minimizing envy between them.
