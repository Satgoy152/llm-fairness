Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  98  68   1  50  12  46  70
1  14  24  36  85  88  43  84   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to examine the valuations each agent has for each item and try to distribute the items such that neither agent envies the other. This means each agent should feel that the bundle of items they receive is at least as valuable as the bundle the other agent receives, according to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 56
  - Item 1: 98
  - Item 2: 68
  - Item 3: 1
  - Item 4: 50
  - Item 5: 12
  - Item 6: 46
  - Item 7: 70

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 14
  - Item 1: 24
  - Item 2: 36
  - Item 3: 85
  - Item 4: 88
  - Item 5: 43
  - Item 6: 84
  - Item 7: 3

A good approach is to allocate items so that the total valuation from each agent's perspective is as equal as possible. 

Let's allocate items step by step:

1. **Allocate high-valued items to each agent based on their preference:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest value for Item 1 (98). We allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has the highest value for Item 4 (88). We allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

2. **Allocate the next high-valued items:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 7 highly (70). Allocate Item 7 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 highly (85). Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Continue balancing the allocations:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 (68) and Item 0 (56) highly. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values Item 6 (84) highly. Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1.

4. **Allocate the remaining items:**
   - The remaining items are 0 and 5. Agent 0 values Item 0 (56) more than Item 5 (12), and Agent 1 values Item 5 (43) more than Item 0 (14).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 and Item 5 to Agent 1.

After allocation, let's verify the total valuation from each agent's perspective:

- **Agent 0's allocation:** Items [1, 7, 2, 0]
  - Total valuation: 98 + 70 + 68 + 56 = 292

- **Agent 1's allocation:** Items [4, 3, 6, 5]
  - Total valuation: 88 + 85 + 84 + 43 = 300

The allocations are quite balanced, with only a small difference in the total valuation from each agent's perspective. This allocation is reasonably fair, minimizing envy between the agents.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7, 2, 0],
    "1": [4, 3, 6, 5]
}
```
