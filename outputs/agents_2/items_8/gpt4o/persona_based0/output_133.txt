Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  34  41  51  44   1  54  19
1  61  31   9  47  67  40  88  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible or at least maximizes the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Given that we have only two agents and eight items, each agent should ideally receive four items.

Let's calculate the allocations based on maximizing the total value for each agent while trying to maintain balance between them:

**Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**
- Agent 0: 74 + 34 + 41 + 51 + 44 + 1 + 54 + 19 = 318
- Agent 1: 61 + 31 + 9 + 47 + 67 + 40 + 88 + 55 = 398

**Step 2: Consider Each Item's Valuation for Both Agents**
- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 74, Agent 1 values at 61
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 34, Agent 1 values at 31
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 41, Agent 1 values at 9
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 51, Agent 1 values at 47
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 44, Agent 1 values at 67
- Item 5: Agent 0 values at 1, Agent 1 values at 40
- Item 6: Agent 0 values at 54, Agent 1 values at 88
- Item 7: Agent 0 values at 19, Agent 1 values at 55

**Step 3: Allocate Items to Maximize Each Agent's Value**
- Items with greater difference in favor of Agent 0: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Items with greater difference in favor of Agent 1: 4, 6, 7
- Items relatively close: 1

Based on the above breakdown, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3, 5
  - Total value: 74 + 41 + 51 + 1 = 167
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 6, 7
  - Total value: 31 + 67 + 88 + 55 = 241

**Final Allocation in JSON Format:**
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives both agents a fair share based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives exactly four items.
