Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  88  49  11  65  44  49  27
1  18  87  33  30  34  12  71  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to ensure an envy-free or fair division of the items between the two agents based on their valuations. One approach is to use the "Adjusted Winner" method or similar methods that balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's compute the total value each agent assigns to all items and try to allocate items such that the total value is as balanced as possible. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 33 + 88 + 49 + 11 + 65 + 44 + 49 + 27 = 366
   - Agent 1: 18 + 87 + 33 + 30 + 34 + 12 + 71 + 73 = 358

2. Start by assigning items where one agent has a significantly higher value than the other.

3. Assign items to balance the total valuations between the two agents.

Following this strategy, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (88) compared to agent 1 (87), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 7 highly (73) compared to agent 0 (27), so assign item 7 to agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 4 highly (65) compared to agent 1 (34), so assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly (71) compared to agent 0 (49), so assign item 6 to agent 1.
- For item 0, agent 0 values it higher (33) compared to agent 1 (18), so assign item 0 to agent 0.
- For item 2, agent 0 values it higher (49) compared to agent 1 (33), so assign item 2 to agent 0.
- For item 3, neither agent values it highly, but agent 1 values it slightly more (30) compared to agent 0 (11), so assign item 3 to agent 1.
- For item 5, agent 0 values it higher (44) compared to agent 1 (12), so assign item 5 to agent 0.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [3, 6, 7]
}
```

- Agent 0's total value: 33 + 88 + 49 + 65 + 44 = 279
- Agent 1's total value: 30 + 71 + 73 = 174

This allocation attempts to maximize agent 0's total valuation while still ensuring agent 1 receives a fair share based on their relative valuations. Adjustments may be needed for envy-freeness or different fairness criteria, but this provides a balanced starting point.
