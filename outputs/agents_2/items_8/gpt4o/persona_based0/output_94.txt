Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  71  15  19  36  35  73  28
1  22  79  73  71  53  90  80  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they would value the allocation of the other agent.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [86, 71, 15, 19, 36, 35, 73, 28]
- Agent 1: [22, 79, 73, 71, 53, 90, 80, 87]

One strategy to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items while ensuring both agents are satisfied with their share. Below is a proposed allocation:

### Proposed Allocation

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 6 (Total valuation: 86 + 71 + 73 = 230)
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 (Total valuation: 73 + 71 + 53 + 90 + 87 = 374)

### Justification

- **Agent 0** has a high valuation for items 0, 1, and 6, which gives them a substantial total value.
- **Agent 1** receives items 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, which they value highly, particularly item 5 (90) and item 7 (87).

With this allocation, each agent receives a set of items that is relatively high in their own valuation, and neither agent should strongly envy the other's allocation given their own preferences.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed between the two agents and each agent gets an allocation that they value significantly.
