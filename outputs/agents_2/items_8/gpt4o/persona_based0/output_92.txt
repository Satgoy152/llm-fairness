Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  77  53  37  80  97  89  74
1  24  58  50  64  44  87  73  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 45 + 77 + 53 + 37 + 80 + 97 + 89 + 74 = 552
- Agent 1's total valuation: 24 + 58 + 50 + 64 + 44 + 87 + 73 + 41 = 441

Now, let's try to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair portion of their total valuation. One simple method is to attempt a "greedy" allocation by assigning each item to the agent who values it more. However, since we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we may adjust the allocation slightly to ensure fairness and completeness.

Let's go through the items and allocate them:

1. Item 0: Valuation by Agent 0 is 45, by Agent 1 is 24. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Valuation by Agent 0 is 77, by Agent 1 is 58. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Valuation by Agent 0 is 53, by Agent 1 is 50. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Valuation by Agent 0 is 37, by Agent 1 is 64. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Valuation by Agent 0 is 80, by Agent 1 is 44. Allocate to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Valuation by Agent 0 is 97, by Agent 1 is 87. Allocate to Agent 0.
7. Item 6: Valuation by Agent 0 is 89, by Agent 1 is 73. Allocate to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Valuation by Agent 0 is 74, by Agent 1 is 41. Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation gives all items to Agent 0, which isn't ideal as Agent 1 gets nothing. To adjust, we will attempt to reallocate some items to Agent 1 while maintaining a balance in perceived value.

Revising the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 4, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 7]

This allocation ensures:

- Agent 0 receives items worth: 45 + 77 + 80 + 97 + 89 = 388
- Agent 1 receives items worth: 50 + 64 + 41 = 155

Both agents have received some of their higher-valued items, and all 8 items have been allocated.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 7]
}
```
