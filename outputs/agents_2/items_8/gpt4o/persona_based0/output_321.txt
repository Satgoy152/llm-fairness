Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  98  19  13  38  82  78   5
1  84  87  75  31  55  29  12  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that neither agent prefers the other's allocation over their own. One approach is to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations and ensure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value for all items: 6 + 98 + 19 + 13 + 38 + 82 + 78 + 5 = 339
- Agent 1's total value for all items: 84 + 87 + 75 + 31 + 55 + 29 + 12 + 28 = 401

Next, we will aim to divide the items such that both agents have a fair share based on their valuations. A fair share for each agent can be considered as half of the total value of all items they value:

- Fair share for Agent 0: 339 / 2 = 169.5
- Fair share for Agent 1: 401 / 2 = 200.5

Now, let's allocate items to the agents to ensure each agent gets a fair share:

1. Start by allocating high-value items to each agent until their fair share is reached.
2. Ensure that the total number of items allocated is 8.

After considering the above, a potential allocation could be:

- Allocate items 1, 5, and 6 to Agent 0. This gives Agent 0 values: 98 + 82 + 78 = 258, which exceeds their fair share.
- Allocate items 0, 2, 3, 4, and 7 to Agent 1. This gives Agent 1 values: 84 + 75 + 31 + 55 + 28 = 273, which exceeds their fair share.

Both agents receive more than their fair share, and the allocation is envy-free since neither agent would prefer the other's allocation based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
