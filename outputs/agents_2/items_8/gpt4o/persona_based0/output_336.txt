Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  5  14  51  54  63  70   6  60
1  6  26  93  52   7  26  49  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve a division where both agents perceive their bundles as roughly equal in value. This is a concept known as envy-freeness. We will do this by considering each agent's valuations and attempting to ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(5 + 14 + 51 + 54 + 63 + 70 + 6 + 60 = 323\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(6 + 26 + 93 + 52 + 7 + 26 + 49 + 70 = 329\)

Next, we will attempt to divide the items such that each agent receives items whose total value (according to their own valuation) is as close as possible to half of their respective total valuation:

- Half of Agent 0's total valuation is \(161.5\).
- Half of Agent 1's total valuation is \(164.5\).

Given these targets, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Start with the highest valuation items for Agent 0: 5, 14, 51, 54, 63, 70, 6, 60
   - Choose items to reach close to 161.5:
     - Items 5 (70), 4 (63), and 7 (60) together give: \(70 + 63 + 60 = 193\)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Considering the remaining items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6
   - Items 2 (93) and 3 (52) together give: \(93 + 52 = 145\)
   - Add item 1 (26) to get \(145 + 26 = 171\)

Now, let's finalize the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [5, 4, 7]
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 1, 2, 3, 6]

Therefore, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items whose total valuations are close to half of their respective total valuations, promoting envy-freeness.
