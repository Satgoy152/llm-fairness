Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  97   5  64  21  19  76  38
1  89  59  89  97  99  18  67  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents in a manner that is fair and aims for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to maximize fairness by ensuring each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's first summarize the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- **Agent 0:** Total valuation = 45 + 97 + 5 + 64 + 21 + 19 + 76 + 38 = 365
- **Agent 1:** Total valuation = 89 + 59 + 89 + 97 + 99 + 18 + 67 + 22 = 540

Next, we'll consider how to allocate the items to minimize envy. One approach is to try to equalize the total value each agent receives according to their own valuation.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Item 1 (Agent 0: 97, Agent 1: 59):** Highest value for Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 3 (Agent 0: 64, Agent 1: 97):** Highest value for Agent 1. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 4 (Agent 0: 21, Agent 1: 99):** Highest value for Agent 1. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 2 (Agent 0: 5, Agent 1: 89):** Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 0 (Agent 0: 45, Agent 1: 89):** Allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 6 (Agent 0: 76, Agent 1: 67):** Highest value for Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Item 5 (Agent 0: 19, Agent 1: 18):** Allocate to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7 (Agent 0: 38, Agent 1: 22):** Allocate to Agent 0.

**Resulting Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:** Items 1, 6, 5, 7
- **Agent 1:** Items 3, 4, 2, 0

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items according to their valuations and aims to balance the total value perceived by each agent.

{
    "0": [1, 6, 5, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 2, 0]
}
