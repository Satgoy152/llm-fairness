Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  49  50  59  66  94  71  96
1  87   6  45  13  39  56  47  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division where we minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of the valuations for the allocated items per agent. This approach doesn't guarantee perfect envy-freeness, but it can be a practical way to achieve a fair allocation given the valuations.

We'll calculate the total value each agent would receive from different allocations and choose one that balances the valuations as evenly as possible. Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Items with relatively high value: 0 (98), 5 (94), 7 (96)
2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Items with relatively high value: 0 (87), 5 (56), 6 (47), 7 (59)

One possible allocation is:

- Assign items [0, 5, 7] to Agent 0
- Assign items [1, 2, 3, 4, 6] to Agent 1

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives high-value items according to their valuations, and Agent 1 receives a larger number of items to compensate for the lower individual valuations they have compared to Agent 0.

Now, let's look at the total valuation for each agent in this allocation:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 98 (Item 0) + 94 (Item 5) + 96 (Item 7) = 288
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 6 (Item 1) + 45 (Item 2) + 13 (Item 3) + 39 (Item 4) + 47 (Item 6) = 150

These allocations provide a relatively balanced distribution based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints of the problem by allocating all items to the agents while attempting to balance their perceived value.
