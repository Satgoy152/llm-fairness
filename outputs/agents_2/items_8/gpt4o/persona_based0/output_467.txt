Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  90  88  69  14  83  28  76
1  91  81  78  17  98  51  85  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 81 78 17 98 51 85 19]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider the valuations of the items by both agents and ensure each agent receives a set of items that they value highly, minimizing potential envy.

Let's begin by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [91, 90, 88, 69, 14, 83, 28, 76]
- Agent 1's valuations: [91, 81, 78, 17, 98, 51, 85, 19]

One potential approach is to assign items to agents in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while also considering the fairness of the distribution. We can start by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent, then adjust as necessary to ensure each agent gets four items.

1. Identify the highest-valued items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Highest values are for items 0 (91), 1 (90), 2 (88), and 5 (83).
   - Agent 1: Highest values are for items 4 (98), 0 (91), 6 (85), and 2 (78).

2. Assign the highest priority items:
   - Since item 0 is valued equally by both agents (91 each), it can be allocated to either. We'll assign it to Agent 0 initially.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (90).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (98).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (85).

3. Resolve conflicts:
   - Item 2 is valued highly by both, but more by Agent 0 (88 vs. 78). Assign it to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (83).

4. Allocate remaining items:
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (17), as Agent 0 already has 4 items.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (19), to ensure each agent receives four items.

The final allocation is:

Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2, 5
Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 6, 7

This allocation balances the distribution based on each agent's preferences, attempting to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
