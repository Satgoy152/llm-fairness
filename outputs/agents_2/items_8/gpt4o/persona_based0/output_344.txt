Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  86  43  94   2  32  53  29
1  18  55  78  95  37  16  74   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their share as at least as good as the other's share.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can approach this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: First, determine the total valuation that each agent assigns to all items.
   - Agent 0 valuations: 11, 86, 43, 94, 2, 32, 53, 29. Total = 350
   - Agent 1 valuations: 18, 55, 78, 95, 37, 16, 74, 8. Total = 381

2. **Fair Share Calculation**: The fair share for each agent is the total valuation divided by the number of agents. For agent 0, the fair share is 350/2 = 175. For agent 1, it's 381/2 = 190.5.

3. **Initial Allocation**: Start by assigning items that have a significantly higher value to one agent over the other. This can help in achieving an envy-free allocation.

4. **Adjustments**: If necessary, make adjustments to ensure both agents perceive their allocation as at least their fair share.

Let's make the allocations:

- Assign item 3 to agent 1 (valued at 95 by agent 1, compared to 94 by agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (valued at 86 by agent 0, compared to 55 by agent 1).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (valued at 37 by agent 1, compared to 2 by agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to agent 1 (valued at 78 by agent 1, compared to 43 by agent 0).
- Assign item 0 to agent 0 (valued at 11 by agent 0, compared to 18 by agent 1).
- Assign item 5 to agent 0 (valued at 32 by agent 0, compared to 16 by agent 1).
- Assign item 6 to agent 1 (valued at 74 by agent 1, compared to 53 by agent 0).
- Assign item 7 to agent 0 (valued at 29 by agent 0, compared to 8 by agent 1).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 0, 5, 7
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 2, 6

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 5, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 2, 6]
}
```
