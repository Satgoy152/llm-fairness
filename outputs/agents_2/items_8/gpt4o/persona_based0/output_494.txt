Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  38  65  68  78   5  20  94
1  55  74  77   6   6  50  53  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims for envy-freeness, we want to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as the others', based on their own valuations. While achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging, especially with indivisible items, we can aim for a distribution that minimizes envy.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 14 + 38 + 65 + 68 + 78 + 5 + 20 + 94 = 382
- Agent 1's total valuation: 55 + 74 + 77 + 6 + 6 + 50 + 53 + 23 = 344

Next, we want to try distributing the items in a way that balances these valuations as evenly as possible across the agents. We can use a greedy algorithm, where we allocate items in descending order of value to the agent who values them the most.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 7 (value 94 for Agent 0, 23 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 0.
2. Item 4 (value 78 for Agent 0, 6 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 0.
3. Item 6 (value 20 for Agent 0, 53 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 1.
4. Item 1 (value 38 for Agent 0, 74 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 1.
5. Item 2 (value 65 for Agent 0, 77 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 1.
6. Item 3 (value 68 for Agent 0, 6 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 0.
7. Item 0 (value 14 for Agent 0, 55 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 1.
8. Item 5 (value 5 for Agent 0, 50 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 1.

This allocation assigns:

- Agent 0: Items 7, 4, 3
- Agent 1: Items 6, 1, 2, 0, 5

Let's verify the valuations:

- Agent 0's allocation: 94 (Item 7) + 78 (Item 4) + 68 (Item 3) = 240
- Agent 1's allocation: 53 (Item 6) + 74 (Item 1) + 77 (Item 2) + 55 (Item 0) + 50 (Item 5) = 309

This distribution minimizes envy because Agent 0 receives the highest-valued items according to their valuation, and Agent 1 receives more items but with a higher total valuation according to their own values.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4, 3],
    "1": [6, 1, 2, 0, 5]
}
```
