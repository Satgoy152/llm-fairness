Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  30  78  85  36  42  68  55
1  20  60  97  50   3  69  94  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 8 30 78 85 36 42 68 55]
 [20 60 97 50  3 69 94 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. We need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation to be at least as valuable as the allocation given to the other agent. 

Here is the valuation matrix for clarity:

- Agent 0: [8, 30, 78, 85, 36, 42, 68, 55]
- Agent 1: [20, 60, 97, 50, 3, 69, 94, 76]

Firstly, we calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 8 + 30 + 78 + 85 + 36 + 42 + 68 + 55 = 402
- Total value for Agent 1: 20 + 60 + 97 + 50 + 3 + 69 + 94 + 76 = 469

Next, we should try to divide items so that each agent gets approximately half of their total valuation.

To achieve an envy-free allocation:

1. Assign high-value items to each agent based on their preferences.
2. Attempt to balance the total valuation for each agent.

After analyzing the matrix, a fair allocation could look like this:

- Assign to Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 4, 7]
- Assign to Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 5, 6]

Let's check the total valuation for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0: 78 + 85 + 36 + 55 = 254
- Agent 1: 20 + 60 + 69 + 94 = 243

This allocation keeps the total valuations close, aiming for fairness.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 6]
}
```
