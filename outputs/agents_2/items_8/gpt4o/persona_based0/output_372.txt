Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  34  97  86  45  37  39  72
1  44  43  92  49  47  41  51  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents while ensuring an integer number of items for each agent, let's consider the concept of maximizing total value for each agent while minimizing envy. The table of valuations for each agent is as follows:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 58     | 34     | 97     | 86     | 45     | 37     | 39     | 72     |
| 1     | 44     | 43     | 92     | 49     | 47     | 41     | 51     | 34     |

First, we calculate the total value of all items for each agent to understand their preference:

- Agent 0 Total Value: 58 + 34 + 97 + 86 + 45 + 37 + 39 + 72 = 468
- Agent 1 Total Value: 44 + 43 + 92 + 49 + 47 + 41 + 51 + 34 = 401

Next, let's allocate items by considering the highest value items for each agent while maintaining the overall fairness:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (97), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 0 values item 3 second highest (86), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (51), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 1 values item 2 second highest, but it's already taken, so we allocate item 1 (43) to Agent 1.
5. Agent 0 values item 0 next highest (58), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
6. Agent 1 values item 4 next highest (47), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
7. Agent 0 values item 7 (72), so we allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
8. Agent 1 values item 5 (41), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

Allocating the items based on these valuations, we try to balance preferences across both agents. The allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 0, 7
- Agent 1: Items 6, 1, 4, 5

Hence, the fair allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 0, 7],
    "1": [6, 1, 4, 5]
}
```
