Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  50  89  29  72  19  13  53
1  14  18  37  59  60  14  19  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free, meaning that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle. Given the valuations, we will try to distribute the items in a way that balances the total valuations for each agent as closely as possible.

First, let's summarize the valuations for each item:

- Agent 0 valuations: [62, 50, 89, 29, 72, 19, 13, 53]
- Agent 1 valuations: [14, 18, 37, 59, 60, 14, 19, 55]

Let's calculate the total valuation for all items for each agent:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 62 + 50 + 89 + 29 + 72 + 19 + 13 + 53 = 387
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 14 + 18 + 37 + 59 + 60 + 14 + 19 + 55 = 276

We want to allocate the items such that each agent's share of their total valuation is as close as possible considering the entire set of items.

To achieve this, we'll consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to maximize the valuation for each agent while trying to keep the total valuation balanced.
2. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.
  
Considering these points, here's one possible allocation:

- Assign items 0, 2, 4, and 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 3, 6, and 7 to Agent 1.

Let's verify the valuation for this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 2, 4, 5] with total valuation of 62 + 89 + 72 + 19 = 242.
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 3, 6, 7] with total valuation of 18 + 59 + 19 + 55 = 151.

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 and Agent 1 receive a fair share of their total potential valuations. The allocations can be represented in JSON format as:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
