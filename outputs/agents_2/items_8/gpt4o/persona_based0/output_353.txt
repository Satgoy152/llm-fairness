Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  67  67  31  71   1  50  34
1  48  16  65  89  23  94  26   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that both agents receive a bundle of items such that neither agent envies the other's allocation assuming each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they would value the other's. This is known as an envy-free allocation. 

First, let's sum up the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 values: 76 + 67 + 67 + 31 + 71 + 1 + 50 + 34 = 397
- Agent 1 values: 48 + 16 + 65 + 89 + 23 + 94 + 26 + 9 = 370

Next, we seek a distribution that maximizes each agent's satisfaction (sum of values of items received), while ensuring that neither envies the other.

One possible allocation could be:

- **Agent 0 (valuing items higher overall):**
  - Item 0 (value 76)
  - Item 1 (value 67)
  - Item 2 (value 67)
  - Item 4 (value 71)
  
  Total value for Agent 0: 76 + 67 + 67 + 71 = 281

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 3 (value 89)
  - Item 5 (value 94)
  - Item 6 (value 26)
  - Item 7 (value 9)
  
  Total value for Agent 1: 89 + 94 + 26 + 9 = 218

This allocation attempts to balance the value received by each agent, given their respective valuations.

Now, let's express the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
