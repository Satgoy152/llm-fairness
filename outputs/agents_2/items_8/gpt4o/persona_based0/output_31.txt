Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  94   4  31  13  96  64  92
1  57  47  11  57  69   8  30  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents with respect to their valuations in a way that minimizes envy, we can use a method like the envy-free allocation, which aims to distribute items such that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by the other agent over their own.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [61, 94, 4, 31, 13, 96, 64, 92]
- Agent 1's valuations: [57, 47, 11, 57, 69, 8, 30, 95]

To achieve a fair division, we can start by considering the items with the highest valuations for each agent and trying to balance the overall value of items each agent receives.

1. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign each agent the item that they value the most.
   - Then, allocate remaining items by alternating between agents while considering both fairness and maximizing each agent's valuation.

Steps:
- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 96.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the highest at 95.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 and item 7 to Agent 1.

2. **Continuing Allocation:**
   - For remaining items, assign them based on the next highest valuations for each agent alternately.

   - Agent 0's next highest after item 5 is item 1 (94), assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's next highest after item 7 is item 4 (69), assign item 4 to Agent 1.

   - Agent 0's next highest after item 1 is item 7 (92), but it's already allocated, so the next is item 6 (64), assign item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's next highest after item 4 is item 3 (57), assign item 3 to Agent 1.

   - Agent 0's next highest after item 6 is item 0 (61), assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's next highest after item 3 is item 0 (57), but it's already allocated, so the next is item 2 (11), assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Final Allocation:**
   - Only item 4 remains for allocation, Agent 0 has fewer items, so assign item 4 to Agent 0.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [0, 1, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: [2, 3, 4, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle they value highly, while maintaining balance in terms of total perceived value.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
