Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  16  17  46  35  52  64  49
1  53  30  30  80   2  34  91  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness in the allocation of items to agents, we need to carefully consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We'll aim to maximize the perceived value for each agent, ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 6 highly at 64.
   - Agent 1 values item 6 even more, at 91, which suggests a strong preference.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 because they value it the most (91).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 because they value it highly at 80.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Items left to allocate: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7.
   - Agent 0 highly values item 5 at 52.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

4. **Continue Allocation by Best Fit:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest remaining value for item 7 at 49.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 also values item 4 at 35.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 17.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Remaining items 0 and 1 can be assigned to Agent 1, as they have already received high-value items.

5. **Final Check:**
   - Ensure all items are allocated correctly and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives four items, and the allocation respects the relative valuations of each agent, minimizing envy and maximizing perceived fairness.
