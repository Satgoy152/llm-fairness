Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74   8   3  82  64  29   5  58
1  62  42  93   4  95  81  20  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[74  8  3 82 64 29  5 58]
 [62 42 93  4 95 81 20 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and achieves a balance in total valuation for each agent. The valuation table is as follows:

```
Agent 0: [74, 8, 3, 82, 64, 29, 5, 58]
Agent 1: [62, 42, 93, 4, 95, 81, 20, 59]
```

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items 3 (82) and 0 (74) highly.
   - Agent 1 values items 4 (95) and 2 (93) highly.

2. **Initial Allocation of High-Value Items:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate items 4 and 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Continue Allocating Based on Remaining High Values:**
   - Agent 0: Allocate item 0 (74).
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 5 (81).

4. **Allocate Remaining Items to Balance Valuation:**
   - Remaining items are 1, 6, and 7.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0: [0, 3, 6, 7]**
  - Total valuation: 74 (item 0) + 82 (item 3) + 5 (item 6) + 58 (item 7) = 219

- **Agent 1: [1, 2, 4, 5]**
  - Total valuation: 42 (item 1) + 93 (item 2) + 95 (item 4) + 81 (item 5) = 311

This allocation provides each agent with an integer number of items and attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives, reducing envy to a practical level.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
