Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  95  65  84  96  90  70  15
1  47  31  87  60  17  87  56  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider both agents' valuations and aim for a distribution where neither agent feels the other has received a better share.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(60 + 95 + 65 + 84 + 96 + 90 + 70 + 15 = 575\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(47 + 31 + 87 + 60 + 17 + 87 + 56 + 41 = 426\)

The challenge is to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as at least half of their total valuation, minimizing any potential envy.

One possible allocation method is to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations and attempt to balance the total perceived value for each agent.

Let's try an allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Choose items with highest value according to their valuation.
   - Highest values for Agent 0 are items: 4 (96), 1 (95), 5 (90), 3 (84).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Choose items with highest value according to their valuation.
   - Highest values for Agent 1 are items: 2 (87), 5 (87), 6 (56).

Now, there are overlaps and some items need to be reassigned to maintain balance.

Let's balance:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 3, 4, 6]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 2, 5, 7]

Now let's calculate the total valuation for each agent with this distribution:

- **Agent 0's valuation**: \(95 + 84 + 96 + 70 = 345\)
- **Agent 1's valuation**: \(47 + 87 + 87 + 41 = 262\)

Both agents receive items valued more than half their total valuation, and the allocation minimizes envy.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 7]
}
```
