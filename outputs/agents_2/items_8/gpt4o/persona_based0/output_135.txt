Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  63  55  91  59  76  33   8
1  49  47  88  38   4  88  10  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations and try to balance the perceived value each agent receives from their allocation. One approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent gets (Maximin Share), while also ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Let's calculate the total value each agent perceives for all items:

- Agent 0's total value: \(77 + 63 + 55 + 91 + 59 + 76 + 33 + 8 = 462\)
- Agent 1's total value: \(49 + 47 + 88 + 38 + 4 + 88 + 10 + 58 = 382\)

We aim to allocate items such that the total perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Now, let's consider potential allocations:

1. **Allocating high-value items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highly (91), so it would be beneficial to allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 highly (88), so it would be beneficial to allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

2. **Allocating remaining items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 (77) and item 5 (76) relatively high, so consider allocating those to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 highly (88), so reallocating item 5 to Agent 1 ensures balance.

3. **Balancing the remaining items:**
   - Allocate the remaining items to balance the total perceived values.

Following these considerations, a possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4, 6
  - Total value for Agent 0: \(77 + 91 + 59 + 33 = 260\)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 5, 7
  - Total value for Agent 1: \(47 + 88 + 88 + 58 = 281\)

This allocation aims to balance the perceived values. The difference in total perceived values is within a reasonable range, considering the discrete nature of item allocation.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 7]
}
```
