Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  30  26  24  18  89  45  67
1  66  25  58  42  98  78  63  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to distribute the items in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

The valuations for Agent 0 are: [35, 30, 26, 24, 18, 89, 45, 67]  
The valuations for Agent 1 are: [66, 25, 58, 42, 98, 78, 63, 59]

One approach to achieving a fair division is to use the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or another method like maximizing the total valuation within each allocation. However, given the simplicity of the problem with only two agents and eight items, we can proceed with a heuristic approach to ensure each agent gets an approximately equal total valuation of items.

### Steps:
1. **Total Valuations**: Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
   - Agent 0 total: 334
   - Agent 1 total: 489

2. **Initial Allocation Heuristic**: Allocate items starting with the highest valuation differences, ensuring each agent gets items that maximize their perceived value while minimizing envy.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Allocate items to ensure each agent gets as close as possible to half of their total valuation, while respecting that each item can only go to one agent and all items must be allocated.

### Allocation:
- Agent 0 highly values item 5 (89) and item 7 (67).
- Agent 1 highly values item 4 (98) and item 0 (66).

By analyzing the key items and balancing out the rest, we can make the allocation as follows:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 1, 5, 7]
  - Valuations: 35 (item 0) + 30 (item 1) + 89 (item 5) + 67 (item 7) = 221

- **Agent 1**: [2, 3, 4, 6]
  - Valuations: 58 (item 2) + 42 (item 3) + 98 (item 4) + 63 (item 6) = 261

This allocation ensures each agent receives a bundle of items valued highly by them while minimizing envy, as each agent is getting items they value significantly.

### Final Allocation JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation is designed to ensure that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations, minimizing potential envy.
