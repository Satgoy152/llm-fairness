Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  58  77  58  47   1  32  55
1  20  40  48  44  85  18   2  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find a fair allocation of items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own bundle.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(13 + 58 + 77 + 58 + 47 + 1 + 32 + 55 = 341\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(20 + 40 + 48 + 44 + 85 + 18 + 2 + 64 = 321\)

Given that there are 8 items, each agent should ideally receive half the total value in terms of their own valuation to ensure fairness.

Next, let's evaluate the valuation of each item by each agent:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| 0    | 13            | 20            |
| 1    | 58            | 40            |
| 2    | 77            | 48            |
| 3    | 58            | 44            |
| 4    | 47            | 85            |
| 5    | 1             | 18            |
| 6    | 32            | 2             |
| 7    | 55            | 64            |

To achieve a fair distribution, we can use a strategic approach by initially assigning items based on maximizing individual agents' valuations, then adjust to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's start by allocating items to each agent:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
4. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
6. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
8. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).

Now, check the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 1, 3, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 4, 7, 0, 5

Calculate the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0: \(77 + 58 + 58 + 32 = 225\)
- Agent 1: \(85 + 64 + 20 + 18 = 187\)

While the allocation is based on maximizing the value per agent, it might not be perfectly envy-free. However, the values are reasonably balanced given constraints.

Finally, provide the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 3, 6],
    "1": [4, 7, 0, 5]
}
```
