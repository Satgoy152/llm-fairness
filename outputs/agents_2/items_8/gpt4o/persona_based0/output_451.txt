Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  56   8  75   3  27  10  93
1  43   6  97  94  10  10  74  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents with the goal of minimizing envy, we should consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim to balance the total value of items each agent receives.

Here are the initial valuations:

- Agent 0: [49, 56, 8, 75, 3, 27, 10, 93]
- Agent 1: [43, 6, 97, 94, 10, 10, 74, 13]

A common method for fair division is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion, which tries to ensure that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. While achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible, we can make an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible given the discrete nature of the problem.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. Start by allocating the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most. This can reduce the potential envy.

2. Allocate Item 3 (valued at 94 by Agent 1) to Agent 1.

3. Allocate Item 7 (valued at 93 by Agent 0) to Agent 0.

4. Allocate Item 2 (valued at 97 by Agent 1) to Agent 1.

5. Allocate Item 0 (valued at 49 by Agent 0) to Agent 0.

6. Allocate Item 6 (valued at 74 by Agent 1) to Agent 1.

7. Allocate Item 1 (valued at 56 by Agent 0) to Agent 0.

8. Allocate Item 5 (valued at 27 by Agent 0) to Agent 0.

9. Allocate Item 4 (valued at 10 by both agents) to Agent 1.

Let's check the allocations and the total values:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 5, 7
  - Total value for Agent 0: 49 + 56 + 27 + 93 = 225

- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 4, 6
  - Total value for Agent 1: 97 + 94 + 10 + 74 = 275

This allocation aims to balance the valuations based on each agent's preferences, minimizing envy given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
