Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  67  48  82  18  34  15   5
1  39  21  56  50  87  81  22  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim to minimize envy, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We'll use a simple approach to achieve this: maximizing the sum of each agent's valuations for the items they're allocated, while ensuring each agent gets a fair number of items.

Let's begin by calculating the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(7 + 67 + 48 + 82 + 18 + 34 + 15 + 5 = 276\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(39 + 21 + 56 + 50 + 87 + 81 + 22 + 76 = 432\)

Given these totals, we aim to allocate items so that each agent's perceived value from their allocation is as close as possible to half of their total valuation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (82), Item 1 (67), Item 2 (48), Item 5 (34), Item 4 (18), Item 6 (15), Item 0 (7), Item 7 (5)
   - Allocate items with highest values: Item 3, Item 1, Item 2, Item 5

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (87), Item 5 (81), Item 7 (76), Item 2 (56), Item 3 (50), Item 6 (22), Item 0 (39), Item 1 (21)
   - Allocate items with highest values: Item 4, Item 7, Item 0, Item 6

### Check Allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 3, 1, 2, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 4, 7, 0, 6

### Valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation from items allocated: \(82 + 67 + 48 + 34 = 231\)
- Agent 1's total valuation from items allocated: \(87 + 76 + 39 + 22 = 224\)

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of value relative to their total valuations.

### Final JSON Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [4, 7, 0, 6]
}
```
