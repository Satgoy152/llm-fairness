Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  13  26   7  67  65  33  89
1  72  94   9  32  78  81  55  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming to achieve envy-freeness, we first need to evaluate each agent's preference or valuation for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels that they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [45, 13, 26, 7, 67, 65, 33, 89]
- Agent 1's valuations: [72, 94, 9, 32, 78, 81, 55, 22]

One possible approach is to use the method of "maximum envy-free" allocation, where we try to minimize the maximum envy across all allocations. Generally, this involves strategic balancing of high-valued items to ensure perceived fairness.

Here is a step-by-step approach to find a fair allocation:

1. **Sort items based on combined valuation** to see which items are most globally valued and need careful allocation:
   - Combined valuations: [117, 107, 35, 39, 145, 146, 88, 111]

2. **Allocate items** by alternating between agents based on preference:
   - Highest combined valuation item (Item 5) is preferred by both but more by Agent 1. Assign it to Agent 1.
   - Next, Item 4 is highly valued by Agent 0 but also by Agent 1; assign it to Agent 0.
   - Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 1, so assign it to Agent 1.
   - Item 7 is more valued by Agent 0, assign it to Agent 0.
   - Item 0 is highly valued by both, but more so by Agent 1, assign it to Agent 1.
   - Item 6 is more valued by Agent 1; assign it to Agent 1.
   - Item 2 is more valued by Agent 0; assign it to Agent 0.
   - Item 3 is of low value to both but slightly more valued by Agent 1; assign it to Agent 1.

3. **Verify totals and allocations** to ensure all items are distributed:
   - Agent 0: Items [4, 7, 2]
   - Agent 1: Items [5, 1, 0, 6, 3]

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived fairness by assigning items where they are most valued and balancing the high-valued items between agents.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7, 2],
    "1": [5, 1, 0, 6, 3]
}
``` 

This allocation considers both agents' valuations and aims to achieve a fair division with minimized envy.
