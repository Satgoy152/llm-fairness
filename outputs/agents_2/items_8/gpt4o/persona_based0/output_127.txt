Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  57  93  14  84  25  76  82
1  22  49  71  81   2  82  11  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1), we aim to make the allocation envy-free or at least minimize envy as much as possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is as good as or better than what the other agent receives, based on their valuations.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 35 + 57 + 93 + 14 + 84 + 25 + 76 + 82 = 466
- Agent 1's total valuation: 22 + 49 + 71 + 81 + 2 + 82 + 11 + 92 = 410

To achieve an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation, we consider how to distribute the items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is as balanced as possible.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest valuations for each agent and allocate items that maximize their satisfaction while keeping the overall distribution balanced.
2. Attempt to ensure that neither agent feels the other has received a more valuable set of items.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0's Highest Valuations:** 
  - Item 2 (93), Item 4 (84), Item 7 (82)

- **Agent 1's Highest Valuations:**
  - Item 7 (92), Item 5 (82), Item 3 (81)

Considering these preferences:

- Assign Agent 0 items: 2, 4, 6, 0
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 93 + 84 + 76 + 35 = 288

- Assign Agent 1 items: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 49 + 81 + 82 + 92 = 304

This allocation seeks to balance the perceived value each agent receives, while ensuring that both agents get items they highly value. It may not be perfectly envy-free, but it minimizes potential envy within the constraints.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.
