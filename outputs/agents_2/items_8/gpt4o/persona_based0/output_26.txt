Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  15  60  77  60  96  40  53
1  25  89  36   0  30  55  71  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while minimizing envy and ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuation each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate the items in a way that is fair and possibly envy-free, where each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 Total Valuation: 74 + 15 + 60 + 77 + 60 + 96 + 40 + 53 = 475
- Agent 1 Total Valuation: 25 + 89 + 36 + 0 + 30 + 55 + 71 + 78 = 384

Now, let's try to allocate the items to minimize envy and give each agent a fair share according to their total valuations.

1. **Initial Allocation based on highest individual valuations:**

   - Agent 0 highly values items: 
     - Item 5 (Value: 96)
     - Item 3 (Value: 77)
     - Item 0 (Value: 74)
     - Item 2 (Value: 60)
     - Item 4 (Value: 60)

   - Agent 1 highly values items:
     - Item 1 (Value: 89)
     - Item 7 (Value: 78)
     - Item 6 (Value: 71)

2. **Assign items based on these preferences:**

   - Agent 0 gets items: 0, 3, 5
   - Agent 1 gets items: 1, 6, 7

3. **Distribute remaining items fairly:**

   Remaining items are: 2, 4

   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (higher value for Agent 0)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (more balance)

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation is designed to be fair based on the agents' valuations of each item while ensuring all items are allocated.
