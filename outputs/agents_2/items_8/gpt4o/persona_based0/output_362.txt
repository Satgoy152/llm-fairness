Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  69  32  44  60  23  81  20
1  83  25  30  60  20  40  80  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as the other agent's allocation. This can be a challenging task with integer allocations, but we will strive to minimize envy to the extent possible.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [50, 69, 32, 44, 60, 23, 81, 20]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [83, 25, 30, 60, 20, 40, 80, 77]

One way to approach this is to use a method like "sequential allocation" or "round-robin" where each agent picks their most preferred item from the remaining items. However, given that we want to minimize envy, a good approach is to try to balance the total perceived value for each agent.

Here is a potential allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items:
   - Total value for Agent 0: 379 (sum of [50, 69, 32, 44, 60, 23, 81, 20])
   - Total value for Agent 1: 415 (sum of [83, 25, 30, 60, 20, 40, 80, 77])

2. The goal is to make the perceived value of allocations as close as possible. Let's allocate items:

- Assign items based on the highest value each agent places on them while maintaining balance:
  - Agent 0: Assign items [0, 1, 4, 7]
    - Values: [50, 69, 60, 20] => Total value = 199
  - Agent 1: Assign items [2, 3, 5, 6]
    - Values: [30, 60, 40, 80] => Total value = 216

3. Review:
   - Agent 0's total value is 199
   - Agent 1's total value is 216

This allocation minimizes envy as much as possible given the constraints of integer item allocations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation should be fairly balanced in terms of the values perceived by each agent.
