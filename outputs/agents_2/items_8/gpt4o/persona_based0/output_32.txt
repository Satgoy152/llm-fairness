Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26   2  47  71  45  12  46  85
1   1  46  70  31  60  36  68  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One well-known method to achieve this is the "Adjusted Winner" procedure, or we can attempt a direct approach by balancing total valuations as closely as possible.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(26 + 2 + 47 + 71 + 45 + 12 + 46 + 85 = 334\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(1 + 46 + 70 + 31 + 60 + 36 + 68 + 59 = 371\)

Now, let's try to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation from their allocated items is approximately equal, which should lead to a fair division.

### Allocation Approach

1. **Distribute high-value items:** Initially allocate high-value items to balance total value.
2. **Iterate to balance:** Check and adjust by swapping items to minimize envy.

#### Initial Allocation:

- Assign item 7 (Agent 0 values at 85) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 (Agent 1 values at 70) to Agent 1.

#### Balancing:

- Allocate item 3 (valued 71 by Agent 0 and 31 by Agent 1) to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 (valued 45 by Agent 0 and 60 by Agent 1) to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 6 (valued 46 by Agent 0 and 68 by Agent 1) to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 5 (valued 12 by Agent 0 and 36 by Agent 1) to Agent 1.

Continue distributing remaining items to balance:

- Allocate item 0 (valued 26 by Agent 0 and 1 by Agent 1) to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 (valued 2 by Agent 0 and 46 by Agent 1) to Agent 1.

#### Check Valuations:

- **Agent 0:** Items 7, 3, 0. Total valuation: \(85 + 71 + 26 = 182\)
- **Agent 1:** Items 2, 4, 6, 5, 1. Total valuation: \(70 + 60 + 68 + 36 + 46 = 280\)

Adjust to balance:

- Move item 1 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 to balance valuations further.

#### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 7, 3, 0, 1. Total valuation: \(85 + 71 + 26 + 2 = 184\)
- **Agent 1:** Items 2, 4, 6, 5. Total valuation: \(70 + 60 + 68 + 36 = 234\)

The final allocation is not perfectly balanced, but it reduces envy between agents as much as possible given integer allocations.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3, 0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 5]
}
```
