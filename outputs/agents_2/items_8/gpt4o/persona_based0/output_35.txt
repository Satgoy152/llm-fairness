Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  28  15  49  14  89  46  80
1  20  97  73  77  25  83  45  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents, we need to consider both maximizing individual valuations and ensuring envy-freeness. Envy-freeness implies that each agent should not prefer the allocation of the other agent to their own.

Let's first look at the total valuations each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 97 + 28 + 15 + 49 + 14 + 89 + 46 + 80 = 418
- Agent 1's total valuation: 20 + 97 + 73 + 77 + 25 + 83 + 45 + 36 = 456

An optimal strategy for a fair allocation is to assign items such that each agent's share is as close as possible to half of their total valuation.

We should also ensure that the allocation is envy-free, meaning that each agent should not prefer the other agent's allocation over their own.

Let's start by allocating items to try to satisfy these goals:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High valuations: Item 0 (97), Item 5 (89), Item 7 (80)
   - Total valuation: 97 + 89 + 80 = 266

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuations: Item 1 (97), Item 2 (73), Item 3 (77), Item 5 (83)
   - Total valuation: 97 + 73 + 77 + 83 = 330

Now we need to adjust the allocation to ensure each item is allocated and no agent prefers the other's allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: 0, 5, 7 (values: 97, 89, 80; total value: 266)
   - Add Item 6 (value: 46) to Agent 0
   - Total valuation: 266 + 46 = 312

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: 1, 2, 3 (values: 97, 73, 77; total value: 247)
   - Add Item 4 (value: 25) to Agent 1
   - Add Item 6 (value: 45) to Agent 1
   - Total valuation: 247 + 25 + 45 = 317

Let's now finalize the allocation. Note that we've already added Item 6 to both agents' calculations, which was a mistake. Letâ€™s correct and finalize the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 5, 6, 7
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 2, 3, 4

This allocation appears to be balanced, and each agent has a fair share based on their own valuations.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
