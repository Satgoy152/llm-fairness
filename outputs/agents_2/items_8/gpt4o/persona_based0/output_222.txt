Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  13  84  67  28  73  27  67
1  99  27  29  46  14  72  61  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items between the two agents while ensuring fairness and minimizing envy, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuation, and ideally, neither agent envies the other's allocation.

### Valuation Matrix:
- Agent 0: 
  - Items: [86, 13, 84, 67, 28, 73, 27, 67]
- Agent 1: 
  - Items: [99, 27, 29, 46, 14, 72, 61, 13]

### Strategy:
1. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**:
   - Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. **Adjust for Fairness**:
   - Check if any adjustments are needed to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share.
3. **Finalize Allocation**:
   - Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Highest Valuation Allocation**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (99 vs 86)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (27 vs 13)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (84 vs 29)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (67 vs 46)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (28 vs 14)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (73 vs 72)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (61 vs 27)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (67 vs 13)

2. **Allocate for Envy-Freeness**:
   - After initial allocation:
     - Agent 0: [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
     - Agent 1: [0, 1, 6]
   - Total items: 8, but Agent 0 has 5 and Agent 1 has 3, needing adjustment.
   - Swap item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 to balance the number of items and improve Agent 1's allocation.
   - New Allocation:
     - Agent 0: [2, 3, 4, 7]
     - Agent 1: [0, 1, 5, 6]

3. **Final Allocation**:
   - Ensure envy-free by verifying agents do not prefer the other's allocation based on their valuations.

### Final Allocation Result:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the item distribution while considering each agent's valuation, thus minimizing envy and promoting fairness.
