Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  60   9  63  65  56  36  40
1   9  90  38  62  14  44  90  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 9 90 38 62 14 44 90 51]]
Output:
To find a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, which means each agent should not prefer the allocation of items of the other agent over their own allocation, based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations: [62, 60, 9, 63, 65, 56, 36, 40]  
Agent 1's valuations: [9, 90, 38, 62, 14, 44, 90, 51]

We can use a simple method to allocate items by considering each agent's valuation for the items and distributing them in a way that balances the perceived value as evenly as possible.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**  
   - Agent 0 values items significantly: 0, 3, 4
   - Agent 1 values items significantly: 1, 6

2. **Assign high-value items to each agent:**
   - Give item 0, 3, 4 to Agent 0.
   - Give item 1, 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Distribute remaining items to balance the total value:**
   - Remaining items: 2, 5, 7
   - Compare remaining values for each agent:
     - For item 2: Agent 0 = 9, Agent 1 = 38 → Assign to Agent 1.
     - For item 5: Agent 0 = 56, Agent 1 = 44 → Assign to Agent 0.
     - For item 7: Agent 0 = 40, Agent 1 = 51 → Assign to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 6, 7

This allocation provides a balanced approach, attempting to minimize envy by focusing on the highest value items for each agent and distributing the remaining items to balance the total perceived value.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 6, 7]
}
```
