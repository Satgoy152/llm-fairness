Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  17  68  81  24  87  92  48
1  55   7  96  66  15   7   9  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or approximately envy-free distribution. Here, both agents should feel that they are getting a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's summarize the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \(73 + 17 + 68 + 81 + 24 + 87 + 92 + 48 = 490\)
- Agent 1: \(55 + 7 + 96 + 66 + 15 + 7 + 9 + 55 = 310\)

Since the total valuation for Agent 0 is higher, we can initially aim to give them more high-value items to balance perceived fairness.

We'll use a simple greedy algorithm to allocate the items based on the highest value for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. Identify the highest-valued items for each agent.
2. Alternate assigning items starting with the agent who values an item the most.
3. Ensure the total number of items allocated equals 8, and no item is allocated more than once.

Following this approach:

1. Agent 1 values item 2 (96) the highest overall, so we'll assign item 2 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 then values item 6 (92) significantly, so we'll assign item 6 to Agent 0.
3. Next, Agent 0 values item 5 (87), so we'll assign item 5 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 0 values item 3 (81), so we'll assign item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Agent 0 values item 0 (73), so we'll assign item 0 to Agent 0.
6. Agent 1 values item 7 (55), so we'll assign item 7 to Agent 1.
7. Agent 1 values item 3 (66) but it's already allocated, so we move to item 0 (55), but it's also allocated. So, we assign item 4 (15) to Agent 1.
8. The remaining item, item 1, goes to Agent 1.

Let's ensure each agent has a fair share:

- Agent 0 receives items: 6, 5, 3, 0
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 7, 4, 1

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(92 + 87 + 81 + 73 = 333\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(96 + 55 + 15 + 7 = 173\)

This distribution is envy-free because each agent receives items that they value highly, and given the constraints, it is balanced in terms of perceived value.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 7]
}
```
