Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  98  80  65  57  76  43  66
1  34  87  71  42  71  26  82  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we strive to achieve a division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their individual valuations.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate the items to get as close as possible to an envy-free allocation:

Valuations:
- Agent 0: [34, 98, 80, 65, 57, 76, 43, 66]
- Agent 1: [34, 87, 71, 42, 71, 26, 82, 80]

1. Identify high-value items for each agent.
2. Try to distribute items in such a way that each agent's total valuation is maximized according to their preferences while keeping the allocations as balanced as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:
- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items: 1 (98), 2 (80), 5 (76).
- **Agent 1** has high valuations for items: 2 (71), 7 (80), 6 (82).

Let's allocate the items based on individual valuations and attempt to balance the total value:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Allocate items 1 (98) and 5 (76) to Agent 0. These are high-value items for Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Allocate items 6 (82) and 7 (80) to Agent 1. These are high-value items for Agent 1.

3. Remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 4
   - Allocate item 0 (34) to Agent 0. It has the same value for both agents.
   - Allocate item 2 (80) to Agent 0. It is a high-value item for both but balances the distribution.
   - Allocate items 3 (42) and 4 (71) to Agent 1. They have relatively higher value for Agent 1 compared to Agent 0.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Total value = 34 + 98 + 80 + 76 = 288
- **Agent 1:** Total value = 82 + 80 + 42 + 71 = 275

This allocation ensures both agents receive items they highly value, and the total valuations are balanced as closely as possible.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 8 items while taking into account the agents' preferences and aims to keep the distribution fair and balanced.
