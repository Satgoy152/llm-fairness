Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  86  38  70  27  56  25  33
1  59  60  31  58  58  70  28  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [59 60 31 58 58 70 28 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a manner that aims to minimize envy and ensure each gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations matrix. The goal is to make the allocation as envy-free as possible, meaning each agent should feel they received at least as much value as they perceive the other agent did.

The valuation matrix is:

```
     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0:  48  86  38  70  27  56  25  33
1:  59  60  31  58  58  70  28  79
```

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 1 with a value of 86.
   - Next, choose item 3 valued at 70.
   - Then choose item 0 valued at 48.
   - Then choose item 5 valued at 56.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 7 with a value of 79.
   - Next, choose item 5 valued at 70.
   - Then choose item 0 valued at 59.
   - Next, choose item 4 valued at 58.

We will adjust this allocation to ensure each agent has a fair share and account for all items:

- **Agent 0: [1, 3, 2, 6]**
  - Total value for Agent 0: 86 (item 1) + 70 (item 3) + 38 (item 2) + 25 (item 6) = 219

- **Agent 1: [0, 5, 4, 7]**
  - Total value for Agent 1: 59 (item 0) + 70 (item 5) + 58 (item 4) + 79 (item 7) = 266

This allocation ensures that each agent receives four items, and all items are distributed. The distribution is aimed at balancing the perceived value each agent receives, making it as fair and envy-free as possible given the constraints.

    "0": [1, 3, 2, 6],
    "1": [0, 5, 4, 7]
