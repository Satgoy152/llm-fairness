Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  17  89  11  52  54  95  99
1  63  60   2  32  22   7  58  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to satisfy envy-freeness and efficiency as much as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that each agent should not prefer the other's allocation over their own. Since there are only two agents, an allocation that maximizes each agent's total valuation can help in achieving a fair distribution. Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 39  
- Item 1: 17  
- Item 2: 89  
- Item 3: 11  
- Item 4: 52  
- Item 5: 54  
- Item 6: 95  
- Item 7: 99  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 63  
- Item 1: 60  
- Item 2: 2  
- Item 3: 32  
- Item 4: 22  
- Item 5: 7  
- Item 6: 58  
- Item 7: 94  

To allocate the items fairly, we can compare the relative preferences of each agent for each item and attempt to distribute them in a manner that balances the total value received by each agent.

Allocation strategy:
1. Allocate items by comparing the difference in valuations:
   - Agent 0 values item 7 at 99 whereas Agent 1 values it at 94. Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 values item 6 at 95 whereas Agent 1 values it at 58. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 89 whereas Agent 1 values it at 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 values item 5 at 54 whereas Agent 1 values it at 7. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 63 whereas Agent 0 values it at 39. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 60 whereas Agent 0 values it at 17. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 32 whereas Agent 0 values it at 11. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 22 whereas Agent 0 values it at 52. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```
