Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  18  52  15  74  42  58  10
1  47  78  27  11  46  95  38  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we seek an allocation that is envy-free, meaning each agent should value their own allocation at least as much as the other agent's allocation. One common approach to achieve this is to use the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or other similar fair division algorithms, but for simplicity, a manual approach can also be effective given the small number of items and agents.

First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 36 + 18 + 52 + 15 + 74 + 42 + 58 + 10 = 305
- Agent 1: 47 + 78 + 27 + 11 + 46 + 95 + 38 + 12 = 354

Since the items cannot be divided, we need to allocate them in a way that maximizes fairness based on the given valuations.

Let's start with a step-by-step allocation:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most:
   - Agent 0's highest value item is item 4 (74).
   - Agent 1's highest value item is item 5 (95).

2. Allocate remaining items by comparing relative values:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (47 vs. 36).
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (78 vs. 18).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (52 vs. 27).
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (15 vs. 11).
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (58 vs. 38).
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (12 vs. 10).

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 4, 6
  - Total value for Agent 0: 52 + 15 + 74 + 58 = 199
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 5, 7
  - Total value for Agent 1: 47 + 78 + 95 + 12 = 232

Both agents receive items they value significantly, and neither allocation is perceived as worse than the other from each agent's perspective.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 7]
}
```
