Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  64  23  16  22  81  89   2
1  81  99  49  23  79  66   2  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents, we will aim to achieve a division that minimizes envy and tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: First, we calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items combined.

   - Agent 0's total valuation: 10 + 64 + 23 + 16 + 22 + 81 + 89 + 2 = 307
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 81 + 99 + 49 + 23 + 79 + 66 + 2 + 84 = 483

2. **Calculate Individual Item Differences**: For each item, we calculate the difference in valuation between the two agents (Agent 0's valuation - Agent 1's valuation).

3. **Sort Items**: Sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuation from highest to lowest. This helps in identifying which items are more contentious and should be allocated first.

4. **Allocate Items**: Start allocating items to the agents in a way that balances the total valuation each agent receives while trying to minimize overall envy.

5. **Adjust for Balance**: Ensure that each agent ends up with 4 items, since there are 8 items in total.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Items with high valuation difference**:
  - Item 1: Agent 0 = 64, Agent 1 = 99 (Difference: -35)
  - Item 5: Agent 0 = 81, Agent 1 = 66 (Difference: 15)
  - Item 6: Agent 0 = 89, Agent 1 = 2 (Difference: 87)
  - Item 0: Agent 0 = 10, Agent 1 = 81 (Difference: -71)

- **Allocation**:
  - Assign items with higher value to the agent who values it more.
  - Aim for equal number of items: 4 each.

**Allocation**:
- Agent 0 gets items: [5, 6, 2, 3]
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 81 + 89 + 23 + 16 = 209
- Agent 1 gets items: [0, 1, 4, 7]
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 81 + 99 + 79 + 84 = 343

**Final Allocations in JSON format**:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive an integer number of items, and every item is allocated. The allocation is also envy-minimizing given the constraints of integer allocations.
