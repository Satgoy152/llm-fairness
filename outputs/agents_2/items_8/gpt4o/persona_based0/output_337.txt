Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  66  49  86  10  62  10  31
1  55  87  89  47  12  19  20  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items where each agent receives an integer number of items, we'll aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to it as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other allocation they might envy.

Let's first review the valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 66
  - Item 2: 49
  - Item 3: 86
  - Item 4: 10
  - Item 5: 62
  - Item 6: 10
  - Item 7: 31

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 87
  - Item 2: 89
  - Item 3: 47
  - Item 4: 12
  - Item 5: 19
  - Item 6: 20
  - Item 7: 91

### Allocation Strategy

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the following strategy:

1. Sort the items based on the difference in valuation between the two agents. This will help us identify items where agents have a strong preference.
2. Allocate items to the agent who values them the most to minimize potential envy.

Here are the differences in valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more by \(55 - 34 = 21\)
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more by \(87 - 66 = 21\)
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more by \(89 - 49 = 40\)
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more by \(86 - 47 = 39\)
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more by \(10 - 12 = -2\)
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more by \(62 - 19 = 43\)
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more by \(10 - 20 = -10\)
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it more by \(91 - 31 = 60\)

Let's allocate based on these differences:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 3, Item 5 (high preference over Agent 1)
  
- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0, Item 1, Item 2, Item 7 (high preference over Agent 0)

Now we need to allocate the remaining items, 4 and 6:

- Item 4: Although Agent 0 has a slightly higher valuation, it might be beneficial to give it to Agent 1 to balance the allocation.
- Item 6: Similarly, give to Agent 1 to balance the allocation given the low negative difference.

### Final Allocation

The final allocation, considering all the items and aiming to minimize envy, would be:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives items to the agents based on their strongest preferences, aiming for a fair and envy-reduced distribution.
