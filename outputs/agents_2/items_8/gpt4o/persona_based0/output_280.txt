Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  83  87  15  27  69  90  95
1  73  48  55  88  34  60  55   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering the valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we need to aim for an allocation where each agent values their own bundle at least as much as they value the other agent's bundle.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(67 + 83 + 87 + 15 + 27 + 69 + 90 + 95 = 533\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(73 + 48 + 55 + 88 + 34 + 60 + 55 + 8 = 421\)

Given that there are 8 items, we will attempt to distribute them so that the perceived value for each agent is as close as possible.

Let's approach this by trying to ensure that each agent gets items such that they value their bundle more than the other agent's bundle.

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**:  
   - Agent 0 values items 6 and 7 highly (90, 95).
   - Agent 1 values items 3 and 0 highly (88, 73).

2. **Start allocation by assigning high-value items**:
   - Give item 6 and item 7 to Agent 0.
   - Give item 3 and item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Complete the allocation**:
   - Remaining items are 1, 2, 4, 5.

4. **Assign remaining items with balance consideration**:
   - Agent 0 gets item 2 and item 5.
   - Agent 1 gets item 1 and item 4.

Let's verify the perceived values:
- Agent 0's items: 6, 7, 2, 5 → \(90 + 95 + 87 + 69 = 341\)
- Agent 1's items: 0, 3, 1, 4 → \(73 + 88 + 48 + 34 = 243\)

Now, let's ensure this allocation is fair (envy-free):
- Agent 0 values Agent 1's bundle at \(67 + 15 + 83 + 27 = 192\), which is less than 341.
- Agent 1 values Agent 0's bundle at \(55 + 8 + 55 + 60 = 178\), which is less than 243.

Thus, both agents prefer their allocated bundles to the other’s, achieving envy-freeness.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 1, 4]
}
```
