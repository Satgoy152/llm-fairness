Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49   9  76  11  62  93  48  26
1  74  21  84  65  94  18  27  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that neither of the agents would prefer the other's allocation over their own.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Identify Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: \(49 + 9 + 76 + 11 + 62 + 93 + 48 + 26 = 374\)
   - Agent 1's total valuation: \(74 + 21 + 84 + 65 + 94 + 18 + 27 + 67 = 450\)

2. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 1 has a higher total valuation, which suggests items are generally more valuable to Agent 1.
   - We aim for a balanced distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start by giving each agent their highest valued items until the total number of items is eight.

4. **Allocate Highest Valued Items:**
   - For Agent 0, the highest valued items are 5 (93), 2 (76), and 4 (62).
   - For Agent 1, the highest valued items are 4 (94), 2 (84), and 3 (65).

5. **Resolve Conflicts:**
   - Item 4 is highly valued by both agents but more so by Agent 1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Item 2 is also highly valued by both agents but more so by Agent 1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

6. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Allocate items 0, 6, 7 to Agent 0, as Agent 1 has already received some of their top preferences.
   - Allocate items 3, 5 to Agent 1, complementing the high-value items already allocated.

7. **Final Allocation:**
   - After resolving conflicts and ensuring all items are distributed, we arrive at an allocation that attempts to satisfy both agents based on their preferences.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items in a manner that is balanced according to their individual valuations, aiming for an envy-free distribution.
