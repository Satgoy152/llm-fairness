Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  9  48  72  10  59  92  23  93
1  7  72  19  36   6  39  59  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of "envy-freeness" and "maximizing total utility". Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of the other agent over their own allocation. Total utility maximization ensures that the sum of the values assigned to each agent is as high as possible.

Let's calculate the sum of each agent's valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 9 + 48 + 72 + 10 + 59 + 92 + 23 + 93 = 406
- Agent 1's total valuation: 7 + 72 + 19 + 36 + 6 + 39 + 59 + 60 = 298

Now, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's individual valuation is maximized while ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Identify items with significantly higher valuations for one agent compared to the other.
2. Assign those items to the agent with the higher valuation.
3. Balance the allocation by ensuring approximately equal distribution of total valuation among agents.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 9 and Agent 1 at 7. Assign to Agent 0 (higher valuation).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 48 and Agent 1 at 72. Assign to Agent 1 (higher valuation).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 72 and Agent 1 at 19. Assign to Agent 0 (higher valuation).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 10 and Agent 1 at 36. Assign to Agent 1 (higher valuation).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 59 and Agent 1 at 6. Assign to Agent 0 (higher valuation).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 92 and Agent 1 at 39. Assign to Agent 0 (higher valuation).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 23 and Agent 1 at 59. Assign to Agent 1 (higher valuation).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 93 and Agent 1 at 60. Assign to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

**Final Allocations:**
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 6

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that neither agent envies the other, as each agent receives items for which they have relatively higher valuations. The total number of items allocated remains 8, fulfilling the requirement.
