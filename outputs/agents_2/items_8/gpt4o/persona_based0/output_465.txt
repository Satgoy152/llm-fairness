Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  62  76  44  25   3  53  60
1  77  10  23  50  96  92   2  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and maximizes the perceived value for each agent. This is often done by trying to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's start by calculating the total value that each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 40 + 62 + 76 + 44 + 25 + 3 + 53 + 60 = 363
- Agent 1's total value: 77 + 10 + 23 + 50 + 96 + 92 + 2 + 86 = 436

Since we have two agents and eight items, each agent should ideally receive four items. To distribute these items fairly, we look for a way to balance the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign items 0, 2, 5, and 7 to Agent 1:
  - Agent 1's valuation: 77 (item 0) + 23 (item 2) + 92 (item 5) + 86 (item 7) = 278
- Assign items 1, 3, 4, and 6 to Agent 0:
  - Agent 0's valuation: 62 (item 1) + 44 (item 3) + 25 (item 4) + 53 (item 6) = 184

This allocation balances the perceived values between the two agents, minimizing envy, given their valuations.

The JSON representation of the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items with high personal valuations, while also balancing the total value of items received by each agent.
