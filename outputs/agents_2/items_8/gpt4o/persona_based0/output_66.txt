Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  45  84  99  87  19  64   0
1  71  60  23  34   5  75  59  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent and try to allocate items such that each agent perceives their bundle to be at least as valuable as the bundle of any other agent. One common method to achieve this is by using the adjusted winner procedure, but since we are limited to allocating whole items, we can use a simpler approach, ensuring that each agentâ€™s total valuation is as balanced as possible.

### Calculating Total Valuations

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0 Total Valuation:** 91 + 45 + 84 + 99 + 87 + 19 + 64 + 0 = 489
- **Agent 1 Total Valuation:** 71 + 60 + 23 + 34 + 5 + 75 + 59 + 41 = 368

Based on these valuations, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their total valuation from their allocated items to be roughly balanced.

### Strategy for Allocation

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's highest value items: 3 (99), 0 (91), 4 (87), 2 (84), 1 (45)
   - Agent 1's highest value items: 5 (75), 0 (71), 1 (60), 6 (59), 2 (23)

2. **Allocate Items to Balance Perceived Value:**
   - Allocate items starting from the highest value an agent assigns to them, ensuring that both agents receive a somewhat balanced total valuation.

### Allocation Plan

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: 3 (99), 0 (91), 2 (84), 7 (0)
   - Total Valuation = 99 + 91 + 84 + 0 = 274

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: 5 (75), 1 (60), 6 (59), 4 (5)
   - Total Valuation = 75 + 60 + 59 + 5 = 199

### Allocation in JSON Format

The allocation ensures each agent is getting a bundle of items that are as close as possible to their perceived valuation, given the constraints of integer item allocation. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 2, 7],
    "1": [5, 1, 6, 4]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items between the two agents, with each agent receiving 4 items.
