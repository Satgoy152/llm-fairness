Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  11  97  18  15  81  99  18
1   1  72  21  35  15  81  28  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 1 72 21 35 15 81 28 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and attempts to be as fair as possible given the constraints.

Let's first summarize the agents' total valuations for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 44 + 11 + 97 + 18 + 15 + 81 + 99 + 18 = 383
- Agent 1's total valuation: 1 + 72 + 21 + 35 + 15 + 81 + 28 + 65 = 318

Now, we'll try to allocate the items to achieve an envy-free (or as close as possible) division. One approach is to assign items in such a way that both agents derive an approximately equal total value from their respective allocations.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Assign item 6 (valued at 99 by Agent 0) to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 5 (valued at 81 by both agents) to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 (valued at 97 by Agent 0) to Agent 0.
4. Assign item 1 (valued at 72 by Agent 1) to Agent 1.
5. Assign item 7 (valued at 65 by Agent 1) to Agent 1.
6. Assign item 0 (valued at 44 by Agent 0) to Agent 0.
7. Assign item 3 (valued at 35 by Agent 1) to Agent 1.
8. Assign item 4 (valued at 15 equally by both) to Agent 0.

After these allocations, let's check the valuations:

- Agent 0's allocated items: [0, 2, 4, 6]
  - Total valuation by Agent 0: 44 + 97 + 15 + 99 = 255
- Agent 1's allocated items: [1, 3, 5, 7]
  - Total valuation by Agent 1: 72 + 35 + 81 + 65 = 253

This allocation is quite balanced in terms of total valuation perceived by each agent.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
