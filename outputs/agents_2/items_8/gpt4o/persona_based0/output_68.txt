Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  75  98  88   1  69  36  35
1  36  99  88  71  97  55  12  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly and ensure envy-freeness, we should aim for a distribution where each agent perceives their share as at least as valuable as the other agent's share. One approach to achieve this is to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while striving to balance the total values.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent would have if they received certain items, and then decide on a fair allocation.

1. **Agent 0's valuations:**

   - Item 0: 76
   - Item 1: 75
   - Item 2: 98
   - Item 3: 88
   - Item 4: 1
   - Item 5: 69
   - Item 6: 36
   - Item 7: 35

2. **Agent 1's valuations:**

   - Item 0: 36
   - Item 1: 99
   - Item 2: 88
   - Item 3: 71
   - Item 4: 97
   - Item 5: 55
   - Item 6: 12
   - Item 7: 32

To achieve a fair division, we should consider the largest values for each agent and try to distribute the items accordingly to maximize perceived fairness.

Let's allocate items:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Picks items with highest valuations: 2 (98), 3 (88), 0 (76), 5 (69)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Picks items with highest valuations: 1 (99), 4 (97), 2 (88), 3 (71)

After considering these allocations, let's sum the total perceived valuation for each agent:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Total value = 98 (for item 2) + 88 (for item 3) + 76 (for item 0) + 69 (for item 5) = 331

- **Agent 1:**
  - Total value = 99 (for item 1) + 97 (for item 4) + 71 (for item 3) + 88 (for item 2) = 355

Now, we need to make sure each agent has a set of items that adds up to a similar perceived value. Let's adjust the allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Assign items 0, 2, 5, 7
  - Total value = 76 + 98 + 69 + 35 = 278

- **Agent 1:**
  - Assign items 1, 3, 4, 6
  - Total value = 99 + 71 + 97 + 12 = 279

Now both agents have a similar total valuation, ensuring a fair distribution. Hereâ€™s the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
