Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  79  80  58  84  58   6  67
1  51  66  87  11  63  79  24  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while trying to equalize their total satisfaction. Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive for various allocations and aim to balance their total valuations as closely as possible.

The agents' valuations for each item are as follows:

Agent 0 valuations: [84, 79, 80, 58, 84, 58, 6, 67]
Agent 1 valuations: [51, 66, 87, 11, 63, 79, 24, 37]

To find a fair allocation, let's consider the following strategy:

1. Sort items by the difference in valuations between the two agents.
2. Allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets an approximately equal total value.

Let's apply this strategy:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item:

   - Item 0: 84 - 51 = 33
   - Item 1: 79 - 66 = 13
   - Item 2: 80 - 87 = -7
   - Item 3: 58 - 11 = 47
   - Item 4: 84 - 63 = 21
   - Item 5: 58 - 79 = -21
   - Item 6: 6 - 24 = -18
   - Item 7: 67 - 37 = 30

2. Sort items by the absolute difference:

   - Item 3: 47
   - Item 0: 33
   - Item 7: 30
   - Item 4: 21
   - Item 5: -21
   - Item 6: -18
   - Item 1: 13
   - Item 2: -7

3. Allocate each item to the agent with the higher valuation, considering balance:

   - Items with positive difference (3, 0, 7, 4) to Agent 0.
   - Items with negative difference (5, 6, 2) to Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 to balance the total value.

Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 3, 0, 7, 4
- Agent 1 gets items: 5, 6, 2, 1

Check total valuations:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 58 + 84 + 67 + 84 = 293
- Agent 1 total valuation: 79 + 24 + 87 + 66 = 256

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations as closely as possible. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 7, 4],
    "1": [5, 6, 2, 1]
}
```
