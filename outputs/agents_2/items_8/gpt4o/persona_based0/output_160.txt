Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  53  90  11  20   4   0  44
1   2  67   8  97  43  85  94  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 2 67  8 97 43 85 94 66]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that neither agent would prefer the other's allocation to their own.

### Valuations Table

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 99     | 53     | 90     | 11     | 20     | 4      | 0      | 44     |
| 1     | 2      | 67     | 8      | 97     | 43     | 85     | 94     | 66     |

### Steps to Achieve Fair Division

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values Item 0 (99), Item 2 (90), and Item 1 (53).
   - Agent 1 highly values Item 3 (97), Item 5 (85), Item 6 (94), and Item 1 (67).

2. **Allocate Items Based on High Valuation:**
   - We aim to balance the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations.

3. **Balancing the Allocation:**
   - Allocate items to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent, ensuring that the total perceived value is as balanced as possible.

### Proposed Allocation

- **Agent 0:**
  - Assign items: 0, 2, 4, 7
  - Total valuation for Agent 0 with these items: 99 (Item 0) + 90 (Item 2) + 20 (Item 4) + 44 (Item 7) = 253

- **Agent 1:**
  - Assign items: 1, 3, 5, 6
  - Total valuation for Agent 1 with these items: 67 (Item 1) + 97 (Item 3) + 85 (Item 5) + 94 (Item 6) = 343

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair amount of value according to their personal valuations, and all items are distributed.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
