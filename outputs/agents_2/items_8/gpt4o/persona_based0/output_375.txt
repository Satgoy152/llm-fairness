Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  37  38  23  80  23  75  86
1  72  45  39  85  34   5  89  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we seek an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent perceives a fair share based on their valuations. Here are the steps and considerations:

1. **Total Value Calculation**:
   - Calculate the sum of valuations for each agent.
   - Agent 0's total value: \(0 + 37 + 38 + 23 + 80 + 23 + 75 + 86 = 362\)
   - Agent 1's total value: \(72 + 45 + 39 + 85 + 34 + 5 + 89 + 71 = 440\)

2. **Fair Share Calculation**:
   - Calculate the fair share for each agent based on the sum of all item valuations.
   - Total sum of all items: \(362 + 440 = 802\)
   - Fair share for Agent 0: \(\frac{362}{802} \times 8 \approx 3.61\) items
   - Fair share for Agent 1: \(\frac{440}{802} \times 8 \approx 4.39\) items

3. **Greedy Allocation**:
   - Start by allocating items to agents based on the highest value they assign to each item.
   - Sort the items based on the highest valuations between the two agents.

4. **Assignment**:
   - Choose items in such a way that the sum of values each agent receives is balanced and close to their fair share.

5. **Resulting Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Choose items 4, 6, 7 (values: 80, 75, 86)
   - Agent 1: Choose items 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 (values: 72, 45, 39, 85, 5)

   These allocations consider both the number of items and the total value received by each agent, aiming to maintain fairness.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
