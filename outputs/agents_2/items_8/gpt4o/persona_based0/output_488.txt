Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  48   5  56  74  17  18  11
1  23  10  17  66  98  21  49  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, meaning each agent should feel that they have received a fair share of the items according to their own valuations.

One approach is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while attempting to balance the total value allocated to each. Given the valuations, let's analyze the situation:

**Agent 0's valuations:**
- Item 0: 87
- Item 1: 48
- Item 2: 5
- Item 3: 56
- Item 4: 74
- Item 5: 17
- Item 6: 18
- Item 7: 11

**Agent 1's valuations:**
- Item 0: 23
- Item 1: 10
- Item 2: 17
- Item 3: 66
- Item 4: 98
- Item 5: 21
- Item 6: 49
- Item 7: 36

To achieve a fair division:
1. Start by assigning items with high disparities in valuation between the agents to the agent who values them more.
2. Ensure that each agent gets 4 items, as there are 8 items in total.

**Allocation Strategy:**
- Agent 0 values item 0 significantly higher than Agent 1, so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 significantly higher, so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Similarly, allocate item 3 to Agent 1 due to high valuation compared to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it much more.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it more.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 because Agent 1's valuation is slightly higher.
- Allocate item 2 and item 7 to Agent 0, since they have a relatively equal low value for both agents.

**Final Allocation:**
- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Agent 1 gets items: 3, 4, 5, 6

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while respecting the individual valuations as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
