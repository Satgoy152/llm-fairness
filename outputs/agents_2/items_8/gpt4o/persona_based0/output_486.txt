Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  24  62   2  52  10  49  21
1  64  31  82  83  66  73  99  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy, ideally achieving envy-freeness. This means each agent should feel that they have received a set of items that they value at least as much as the set of items received by the other agent.

Given the valuations, we can proceed with the allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   For Agent 0: \( 11 + 24 + 62 + 2 + 52 + 10 + 49 + 21 = 231 \)
   
   For Agent 1: \( 64 + 31 + 82 + 83 + 66 + 73 + 99 + 90 = 588 \)

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - We want to balance the perceived value of the items each agent receives.
   - One possible way to achieve this is by allocating items based on their highest valuation for each agent, considering the cumulative value each agent receives.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Assign items one by one, aiming to balance the total valuations for both agents.

Let's execute this process:

- Agent 1 has significantly higher valuations. We start by assigning some of the high-value items to Agent 1.

  - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 99).
  - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 83).
  - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 82).
  - Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 90).

- Now, Agent 1 has a total valuation of \( 99 + 83 + 82 + 90 = 354 \).

- Next, allocate the remaining items to Agent 0:

  - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 11).
  - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 24).
  - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 52).
  - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 10).

- Agent 0 now has a total valuation of \( 11 + 24 + 52 + 10 = 97 \).

This allocation does not achieve perfect envy-freeness but tries to balance total perceived value given the large valuation disparity.

**Final Allocation in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
