Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  30  51  99  90  25  22  56
1  51  12  28  45  13  20  24   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim for envy-freeness, meaning each agent should not envy the other's allocation given their own valuations. We also need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: \(55 + 30 + 51 + 99 + 90 + 25 + 22 + 56 = 428\)
- Agent 1's total value: \(51 + 12 + 28 + 45 + 13 + 20 + 24 + 4 = 197\)

Next, we can try to allocate items so that the perceived value by each agent is as balanced as possible, given their different valuations.

A possible allocation strategy is to have each agent take turns picking their most valued remaining item. This approach doesn't always guarantee a perfect envy-free solution but can help us find a balanced allocation.

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (99), so they take it.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (51), so they take it.
3. Agent 0 values item 4 the next highest (90), so they take it.
4. Agent 1 values item 2 the next highest (28), so they take it.
5. Agent 0 values item 2 next, but it's taken, so they take item 0 (55).
6. Agent 1 values item 6 next (24), so they take it.
7. Agent 0 values item 1 next (30), so they take it.
8. Agent 1 values item 5 next (20), so they take it.
9. Agent 0 values item 7 next (56), so they take it.

Now let's evaluate the allocations:

- Agent 0 has: items [3, 4, 0, 1, 7].
- Agent 1 has: items [0, 2, 6, 5].

However, upon review, Agent 0 was allocated item 0 twice. Let's re-evaluate the allocations to ensure no duplication:

Revised Allocation:
- Agent 0: [3, 4, 1, 7] (Total value: 99 + 90 + 30 + 56 = 275)
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 5, 6] (Total value: 51 + 28 + 20 + 24 = 123)

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives 4 items.

Finally, here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 1, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 6]
}
```
