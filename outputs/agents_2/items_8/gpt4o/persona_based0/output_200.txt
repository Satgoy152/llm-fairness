Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0  1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  7  85  56   0  52  75  11
1  29  5  49   8  40  79  73  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to minimize envy, such as the Envy-Free (EF) allocation method. Our goal is to allocate items such that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 7
  - Item 2: 85
  - Item 3: 56
  - Item 4: 0
  - Item 5: 52
  - Item 6: 75
  - Item 7: 11

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 29
  - Item 1: 5
  - Item 2: 49
  - Item 3: 8
  - Item 4: 40
  - Item 5: 79
  - Item 6: 73
  - Item 7: 47

A reasonable approach is to allocate items by selecting the most valuable items for each agent in a manner that balances their overall perceived value. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0:** Highly valued by Agent 0 (95) compared to Agent 1 (29). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 5:** Highly valued by Agent 1 (79) compared to Agent 0 (52). Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2:** Highly valued by Agent 0 (85) compared to Agent 1 (49). Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 6:** Similar high value for both, but Agent 0 has already received high-value items. Allocate to Agent 1 (73 vs. 75).
5. **Item 3:** Allocate to Agent 0 (56 vs. 8) since Agent 1 has received high-value items already.
6. **Item 7:** Allocate to Agent 1 (47 vs. 11) as it balances the lower value items Agent 1 has received.
7. **Item 4:** Allocate to Agent 1 (40 vs. 0) as it adds value to Agent 1's allocation.
8. **Item 1:** Allocate to Agent 0 (7 vs. 5) as both have low values and Agent 0 has a smaller total value so far.

The allocations are made with a focus on balancing the total perceived value for each agent.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 1],
    "1": [5, 6, 7, 4]
}
```
