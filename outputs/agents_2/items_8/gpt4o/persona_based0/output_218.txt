Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  68  72  22  47  21  79  46
1  16   4  30  74  26   8  10  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize each agent's satisfaction. The key is to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their own valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0: `76 + 68 + 72 + 22 + 47 + 21 + 79 + 46 = 431`
- Agent 1: `16 + 4 + 30 + 74 + 26 + 8 + 10 + 57 = 225`

Next, we'll try to allocate items such that each agent gets items they highly value, while also attempting to balance the total value allocated to each agent.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 6 (79), item 0 (76), and item 2 (72).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (74) and item 7 (57).

Now, let's allocate these items based on high valuations:

- Allocate item 6, item 0, and item 2 to **Agent 0**.
- Allocate item 3 and item 7 to **Agent 1**.

Next, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 4, 5) to balance the allocations:

- **Agent 0** values item 1 (68) considerably, so allocate item 1 to **Agent 0**.
- Allocate item 4 (26) and item 5 (8) to **Agent 1** since these items have moderate values for Agent 1 and relatively lower for Agent 0.

### Allocation Summary:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1, 2, 6]
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 4, 5, 7]

This allocation should be perceived as fair given the valuations, with each agent getting items they value significantly.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
