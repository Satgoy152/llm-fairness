Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  80  75  42  66  80  73  78
1  61  27  48  60  43  10  67  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while striving for an envy-free solution, we start by considering each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share, ideally minimizing envy.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 12 + 80 + 75 + 42 + 66 + 80 + 73 + 78 = 506
- Agent 1's total valuation: 61 + 27 + 48 + 60 + 43 + 10 + 67 + 22 = 338

Next, we'll aim to allocate the items so that each agent receives a set of items maximizing their perceived value. This often involves iterative testing to find a suitable distribution. Here, we'll use a heuristic approach, attempting to balance the value each agent receives.

Let's try an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: We'll allocate items with high value for Agent 0 that are not as highly valued by Agent 1:
   - Items 1, 2, 5, 7

2. **Agent 1**: We'll allocate items with relatively higher value for Agent 1:
   - Items 0, 3, 4, 6

Check the total valuation for each agent with the proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0's allocation**: Items [1, 2, 5, 7]
  - Total valuation: 80 + 75 + 80 + 78 = 313

- **Agent 1's allocation**: Items [0, 3, 4, 6]
  - Total valuation: 61 + 60 + 43 + 67 = 231

This allocation provides a reasonable distribution of value given the constraints, with Agent 0 receiving a slightly higher total valuation but not overwhelmingly so given their original valuation structure.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
