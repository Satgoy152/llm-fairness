Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  29  13  21  74  97  28  77
1  26  91  36  87  52  31  66  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 91 36 87 52 31 66 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can approach this problem using the concept of maximizing the total utility for each agent while ensuring that neither agent envies the allocation of the other.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [22, 29, 13, 21, 74, 97, 28, 77]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [26, 91, 36, 87, 52, 31, 66, 53]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a method such as the envy-free up to one item (EF1) allocation. This approach doesn't guarantee absolute envy-freeness but ensures that any envy can be resolved by removing at most one item from the envied bundle.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify high-value items**: Start by identifying the items that are highly valued by each agent. We aim to allocate these items to ensure each agent receives a fair share of high-value items.

2. **Balance the total valuation**: Ensure that the total value of the items allocated to each agent is as balanced as possible, considering their respective valuations.

### Implementing the strategy:

1. **High-value items for Agent 0**: Item 5 (value 97), Item 4 (value 74)
2. **High-value items for Agent 1**: Item 1 (value 91), Item 3 (value 87)

#### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Items: 0, 2, 4, 5
  - Total valuation: 22 + 13 + 74 + 97 = 206

- **Agent 1**:
  - Items: 1, 3, 6, 7
  - Total valuation: 91 + 87 + 66 + 53 = 297

This allocation attempts to balance the maximum perceived value by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly. Let's ensure the allocation is envy-free up to one item.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This distribution aims to provide a fair allocation by maximizing each agent's total valuation while maintaining a reasonable balance.
