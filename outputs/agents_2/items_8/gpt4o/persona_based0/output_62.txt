Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4   6  70  98   9  72  90  84
1  28  18  76  34  27  53   5  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we will aim to make the distribution envy-free and equitable, considering each agent's valuations. The goal is to minimize envy by ensuring each agent feels they have received an equitable share based on their valuations.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0's total valuation**: 4 + 6 + 70 + 98 + 9 + 72 + 90 + 84 = 433
- **Agent 1's total valuation**: 28 + 18 + 76 + 34 + 27 + 53 + 5 + 95 = 336

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items to balance the perceived value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0** highly values:
   - Item 3 (98)
   - Item 6 (90)
   - Item 7 (84)
   - Item 5 (72)

2. **Agent 1** highly values:
   - Item 7 (95)
   - Item 2 (76)
   - Item 5 (53)
   - Item 3 (34)

We should aim to allocate based on these high valuations while trying to ensure each agent feels their allocation is fair.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Assign highly valued items: 3, 6, 0, 1
  - Total valuation for Agent 0 with these items: 98 + 90 + 4 + 6 = 198

- **Agent 1**:
  - Assign highly valued items: 7, 2, 5, 4
  - Total valuation for Agent 1 with these items: 95 + 76 + 53 + 27 = 251

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives, aiming for a fair distribution without envy.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 0, 1],
    "1": [7, 2, 5, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives 4 items, and we ensure all items are distributed, fulfilling the given conditions.
