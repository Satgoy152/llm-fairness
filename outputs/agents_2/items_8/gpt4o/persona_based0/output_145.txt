Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  21   8  31  28   4  81  78
1  19  46  30   5  60  28  27  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items such that no agent envies the other. Envy-freeness means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent. 

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
- Agent 0: \(80 + 21 + 8 + 31 + 28 + 4 + 81 + 78 = 331\)
- Agent 1: \(19 + 46 + 30 + 5 + 60 + 28 + 27 + 12 = 227\)

Given these total valuations, we can aim for each agent to receive approximately half of their total value. However, since the total valuations differ significantly, we'll attempt to balance the allocations so that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their valuations.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 6, and 7. Allocating these items to Agent 0 gives them a substantial value.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 significantly. Assigning item 4 to Agent 1 would be suitable.
3. The remaining items should be distributed to balance the overall perceived value for each agent.

Let's allocate:
- Agent 0: [0, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Now, let's verify the total values:
- Agent 0 values their allocation at \(80 + 81 + 78 = 239\).
- Agent 1 values their allocation at \(46 + 30 + 5 + 60 + 28 = 169\).

Each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations without envying the other's allocation.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
