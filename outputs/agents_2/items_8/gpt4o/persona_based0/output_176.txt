Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  41  84   4  56  45  23  63
1  97  98  21  82  35  94  43  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we will aim for an allocation that is envy-free and as fair as possible given the valuations. We will use a simple heuristic approach by considering the preferences of the agents and trying to distribute items such that neither agent envies the other.

First, let's list each agent's total valuation for all items:

- Agent 0: 91 + 41 + 84 + 4 + 56 + 45 + 23 + 63 = 407
- Agent 1: 97 + 98 + 21 + 82 + 35 + 94 + 43 + 92 = 562

Next, we calculate the average value per item each agent would ideally receive to ensure fairness:

- Total value combined: 407 + 562 = 969
- Ideal average value per agent: 969 / 2 = 484.5

Now, we need to allocate items while aiming to balance these valuations as closely as possible:

1. Start by allocating items with the highest individual valuations for each agent.
2. Ensure that the total valuation for each agent is as close to their ideal value of 484.5 as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0 (91) and 2 (84).
- Agent 1 highly values items 1 (98), 0 (97), and 5 (94).

To balance, we'll begin by allocating items with the highest value for each agent:

1. Give Agent 0 items 0 and 2.
2. Give Agent 1 items 1 and 5.

Now, let's continue by allocating the remaining items:

- Items left: 3, 4, 6, 7
- Remaining valuations for Agent 0: 4, 56, 23, 63
- Remaining valuations for Agent 1: 82, 35, 43, 92

Continue allocating based on maximizing the remaining value for each agent:

- For Agent 0, allocate item 4 (56).
- For Agent 1, allocate item 3 (82).

Remaining items are 6 and 7:

- Give Agent 0 item 7 (63).
- Give Agent 1 item 6 (43).

Final allocation results in:

- Agent 0: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Agent 1: 1, 3, 5, 6

This allocation seeks to balance total valuations given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned while considering the agents' preferences, aiming to minimize envy and achieve fairness.
