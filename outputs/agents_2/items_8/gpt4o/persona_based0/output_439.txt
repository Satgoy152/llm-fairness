Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  52  83  25  57  96  26  27
1  40  20  24  58   2  34  93  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[66 52 83 25 57 96 26 27]
 [40 20 24 58  2 34 93 77]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we should consider their valuations for each item. The goal is to maximize each agent's total value of the items they receive while balancing the total value across both agents.

### Valuations Table
- **Agent 0**: [66, 52, 83, 25, 57, 96, 26, 27]
- **Agent 1**: [40, 20, 24, 58, 2, 34, 93, 77]

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: Start by identifying items that have significantly higher valuations for each agent compared to the other agent. 

2. **Allocate based on maximizing total value**: Aim to give each agent the items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets a similar total valuation.

3. **Swap and adjust**: If necessary, swap items to balance the total valuation while keeping individual valuations high.

### Proposed Allocation
- **Agent 0**: 
  - Items that have significantly higher valuation for Agent 0 compared to Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 5.
  - Additional item to balance the total value: Item 4.

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Items that have significantly higher valuation for Agent 1 compared to Agent 0: Items 6, 7.
  - Additional items to balance total value: Items 1, 3.

### Allocation Breakdown
- **Agent 0** receives items [0, 2, 4, 5].
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 66 (item 0) + 83 (item 2) + 57 (item 4) + 96 (item 5) = 302

- **Agent 1** receives items [1, 3, 6, 7].
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 20 (item 1) + 58 (item 3) + 93 (item 6) + 77 (item 7) = 248

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation received by each agent, while also considering individual item preferences.

### Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and aims to be as fair as possible based on the given valuations.
