Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  45   1  89  40  39  60  26
1  93   6  55  69  61  64  93   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, trying to make each agent feel they received their fair share based on their valuations. One possible approach is to compute the total valuation each agent would receive if they were allocated specific items, and try to equalize these totals as much as possible.

Let's calculate the total value for each scenario:

### Step 1: Valuations for each item
- **Agent 0:** [80, 45, 1, 89, 40, 39, 60, 26]
- **Agent 1:** [93, 6, 55, 69, 61, 64, 93, 9]

### Step 2: Allocation Strategy
Given the total number of items, our goal is to divide them so that the perceived value for each agent is as equal as possible. We can try to draft items for each agent and see how the allocation impacts their total valuation.

### Step 3: Initial Allocation
Let's start by allocating items based on each agent's higher preference, attempting to balance the total value received:

1. **Agent 0:** Prefers items that have higher personal value.
2. **Agent 1:** Prefers items that have higher personal value.

### Step 4: Trial Allocations
- Assign items based on descending order of value preference for each agent while ensuring both agents get at least some items.

### Trial Allocation Attempt:
- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 3, 5, 7]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 80 + 89 + 39 + 26 = 234
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 2, 4, 6]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 6 + 55 + 61 + 93 = 215

The allocation is close in terms of total value received by each agent. 

### Final Allocation:
Based on this attempt, we can finalize the allocation as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 and Agent 1 a relatively balanced total valuation, while ensuring all items are allocated.
