Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  68  21   7  81  90  38  54
1  81  95   7  69   9  72  34  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to create an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation received by the other agent, according to their own valuation.

Let's analyze the situation:

**Agent 0's valuations:**
- Item 0: 21
- Item 1: 68
- Item 2: 21
- Item 3: 7
- Item 4: 81
- Item 5: 90
- Item 6: 38
- Item 7: 54

**Total value for Agent 0:** 380

**Agent 1's valuations:**
- Item 0: 81
- Item 1: 95
- Item 2: 7
- Item 3: 69
- Item 4: 9
- Item 5: 72
- Item 6: 34
- Item 7: 10

**Total value for Agent 1:** 377

To find an allocation, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives based on their own valuation:

1. **Agent 0:** Highly values items 4 and 5 (81 and 90).
2. **Agent 1:** Highly values items 0 and 1 (81 and 95).

Given these preferences, a reasonable allocation can be made as follows:

- Allocate items 4, 5, 6, and 7 to Agent 0. These items have high value for Agent 0, and they sum to 263.
- Allocate items 0, 1, 2, and 3 to Agent 1. These items include the ones Agent 1 values highly, and they sum to 298.

This way, both agents receive a total value that reflects their preferences closely, and neither agent is particularly envious of the other's allocation based on their valuations.

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```
