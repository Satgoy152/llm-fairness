Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  70   1  40  81  31  10  38
1  63  44  87  13  75  67  21  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering the goal of minimizing envy (where an agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own), we can use a method that considers the valuations provided in the table.

Let's break down the approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: 62, 70, 1, 40, 81, 31, 10, 38
     - Total = 333
   - Agent 1: 63, 44, 87, 13, 75, 67, 21, 72
     - Total = 442

2. **Fair Share for Each Agent**:
   - Each agent should ideally receive items totaling at least half of their total valuation since we have two agents. 
   - Fair share for Agent 0 = 333 / 2 = 166.5
   - Fair share for Agent 1 = 442 / 2 = 221

3. **Allocate Items by Highest Valuation Preference**:
   - Start by allocating items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them, to achieve a fair and envy-free distribution.

4. **Iteratively Assign Items**:
   - Consider the highest valued items for each agent and start allocating them while balancing the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Prefers items: 4 (81), 1 (70), 0 (62), 3 (40), 5 (31), 7 (38), 6 (10), 2 (1)
- **Agent 1**:
  - Prefers items: 2 (87), 5 (67), 4 (75), 7 (72), 0 (63), 6 (21), 1 (44), 3 (13)

Let's allocate the items to ensure a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 1, 3, 6
  - Total value for Agent 0 = 62 + 70 + 40 + 10 = 182

- Agent 1 gets items: 2, 4, 5, 7
  - Total value for Agent 1 = 87 + 75 + 67 + 72 = 301

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a value close to their fair share and minimizes potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
