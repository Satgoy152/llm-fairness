Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  39  48  43  18  19  24  33
1  14  73  63  95  92  56  84  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents using the concept of envy-freeness, we can consider the valuation each agent has for the items and try to distribute them such that neither agent envies the other. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as they would if given any other agent's allocation.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and then attempt to allocate items to balance the perceived value.

Agent 0's valuation of items:
- Total value = 94 + 39 + 48 + 43 + 18 + 19 + 24 + 33 = 318

Agent 1's valuation of items:
- Total value = 14 + 73 + 63 + 95 + 92 + 56 + 84 + 89 = 566

Given that the total value perceived by both agents is different, we should focus on equalizing the perceived value through the allocation of items.

### Allocation Strategy
The goal is to ensure that both agents feel they have received a fair share, considering their valuations. We should try to give each agent a share that closely matches their total valuation proportions, while also aiming to keep each agent from envying the other's allocation.

### Allocation Process
1. Identify high-value items for each agent to ensure they feel satisfied.
2. Assign items to each agent such that the total value of the allocated items is as close as possible to half of their total perceived value.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign items {0, 5, 6, 7} to Agent 1, which have a high valuation for Agent 1.
- Assign items {1, 2, 3, 4} to Agent 0, which are relatively more valued by Agent 0.

### Calculation of Allocated Values
- Agent 0's allocated items: 39 + 48 + 43 + 18 = 148
- Agent 1's allocated items: 94 + 19 + 24 + 33 = 170

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a significant portion of their total perceived value, and neither agent receives an obviously envied allocation based on their own valuations.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation should help in achieving a fair distribution based on the valuation each agent assigns to the items.
