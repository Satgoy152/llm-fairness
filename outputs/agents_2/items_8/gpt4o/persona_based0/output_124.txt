Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  19  96  20  37  38  24  12
1  72  69  12  76  89  56  92  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation or as close to it as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation to the other agent. Given the valuations, this can be challenging, but we can attempt to minimize envy as much as possible.

Here are the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [74, 19, 96, 20, 37, 38, 24, 12]
- Agent 1: [72, 69, 12, 76, 89, 56, 92, 95]

To allocate items fairly, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:** We start by identifying items that are highly valued by each agent.
   
2. **Allocate High-Value Items:** Assign items that are uniquely highly valued by one agent to that agent.

3. **Balance the Total Value:** Try to balance the total valuation of items allocated to each agent.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:** Distribute remaining items such that the total value is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0's High-Value Items:** Agent 0 highly values item 2 (96).
2. **Agent 1's High-Value Items:** Agent 1 highly values items 4 (89) and 7 (95).

**Initial Allocation Based on High-Value Items:**
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [4, 7]

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**

- Agent 0 values item 0 (74) highly compared to Agent 1.
- Agent 1 values item 6 (92) highly compared to Agent 0.

After considering the remaining items and balancing the total valuation, we can allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 1, 2, 5
- **Agent 1:** Items 3, 4, 6, 7

**Valuation Check:**

- **Agent 0's Total Valuation:** 74 + 19 + 96 + 38 = 227
- **Agent 1's Total Valuation:** 76 + 89 + 92 + 95 = 352

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent. Although it may not be perfectly envy-free, it considers the highest valuations and attempts to distribute items fairly based on the given preferences.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 7]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
