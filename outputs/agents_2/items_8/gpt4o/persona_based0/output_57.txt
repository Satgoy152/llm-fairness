Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95   5  61  94  16  52  74   7
1  25  51  80  37  20  91  99  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. Envy-freeness means that after the allocation, no agent should prefer the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's first summarize the valuation for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: values for items: [95, 5, 61, 94, 16, 52, 74, 7]
- Agent 1: values for items: [25, 51, 80, 37, 20, 91, 99, 36]

To find a fair allocation, we can use the following strategy: 

1. Assign items one by one in such a way that each agent receives items that they value highly, while ensuring that the allocation remains balanced in terms of total value received by each agent.

Let's go through a step-by-step allocation process:

**Step 1**: Compare the highest valued items for each agent and allocate accordingly:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0 (95) and 3 (94).
- Agent 1 highly values items 6 (99) and 5 (91).

Assign these highly valued items first:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 5 and 6.

**Step 2**: Allocate the remaining items while trying to balance the total value received by each agent.

Remaining items are: 1, 2, 4, 7.

- Agent 0 values item 2 at 61, which is relatively high for them.
- Agent 1 values item 2 at 80, which is higher for them.

Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

Remaining items: 1, 4, 7.

- Agent 0 values item 4 at 16.
- Agent 1 values item 4 at 20.

Assign item 4 to Agent 1 for better balance.

Remaining items: 1, 7.

- Agent 0 values item 1 at 5 and item 7 at 7.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 51 and item 7 at 36.

Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

Finally, assign item 7 to Agent 0.

Now, let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 7]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the total value received by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly, aiming to achieve an envy-free distribution as possible given the constraints.
