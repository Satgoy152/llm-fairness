Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  32  40   9  34  94  25  50
1  85  82  97  38  75  27  89  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations for each item from both agents. Our goal is to divide the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as what the other agent receives. We want to minimize any potential envy while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's begin by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [30, 32, 40, 9, 34, 94, 25, 50]
- Agent 1's valuations: [85, 82, 97, 38, 75, 27, 89, 83]

We'll consider allocating high-value items according to each agent's preference to minimize envy. 

### Step 1: Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation

1. **Agent 1's Highest Valuations:**
   - Item 2: 97
   - Item 0: 85
   - Item 1: 82
   - Item 7: 83

2. **Agent 0's Highest Valuations:**
   - Item 5: 94
   - Item 7: 50
   - Item 2: 40
   - Item 4: 34

### Step 2: Allocate Based on Priorities

- Allocate items starting with the highest valuation per agent to ensure that each receives items they value highly.

**Allocations:**

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 2 (97)
  - Item 0 (85)
  - Item 1 (82)

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 5 (94)
  - Item 4 (34)

### Step 3: Allocate Remaining Items

We have allocated 5 items so far, leaving 3 items to be allocated (items 3, 6, and 7).

- **Agent 1:**
  - Add Item 3 (38) - next highest valued by Agent 1
  - Add Item 6 (89) - high value for Agent 1

- **Agent 0:**
  - Add Item 7 (50) - higher value for Agent 0 than remaining options

### Final Allocation

Let's review the allocations to ensure fairness and that each agent gets an integer number of items. We should ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent perceives their allocation as valuable.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 0, 1, 3, 6]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items [5, 4, 7] with valuations [94, 34, 50].
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 0, 1, 3, 6] with valuations [97, 85, 82, 38, 89].

All 8 items have been allocated, and the allocation aims to minimize envy by aligning with each agent's highest valuations.
