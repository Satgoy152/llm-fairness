Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  56  84  20   9  83  42  40
1  69   1  29  73  63  66   1  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation. Here, we have two agents and eight items. Let's proceed with a fair division:

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0:** [91, 56, 84, 20, 9, 83, 42, 40]
- **Agent 1:** [69, 1, 29, 73, 63, 66, 1, 47]

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **High Valuations First:** Start by allocating items that each agent values significantly higher than the other agent:
   - **Item 0:** Agent 0 values this at 91 compared to Agent 1's 69. Assign to Agent 0.
   - **Item 1:** Agent 0 values this at 56 compared to Agent 1's 1. Assign to Agent 0.
   - **Item 3:** Agent 1 values this at 73 compared to Agent 0's 20. Assign to Agent 1.
   - **Item 4:** Agent 1 values this at 63 compared to Agent 0's 9. Assign to Agent 1.

2. **Balance Remaining Items:**
   - **Item 5:** Agent 0 values this at 83 compared to Agent 1's 66. Assign to Agent 0.
   - **Item 2:** Agent 0 values this at 84 compared to Agent 1's 29. Assign to Agent 0.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - **Item 6:** Although both value it low, Agent 0's valuation (42) is higher than Agent 1's (1). Assign to Agent 0.
   - **Item 7:** Agent 1 values this at 47 compared to Agent 0's 40. Assign to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 1, 2, 5, 6]
- **Agent 1:** Items [3, 4, 7]

This allocation seeks to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their bundle, reducing potential envy.

### JSON Allocation:

{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 7]
}
