Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  21  46  56  47  23  52  22
1  60  93  25  81  44  49  77   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while minimizing envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. The goal is to distribute the items so that both agents feel they have received an equitable share according to their valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items collectively:

- Agent 0 total valuation: \(40 + 21 + 46 + 56 + 47 + 23 + 52 + 22 = 307\)
- Agent 1 total valuation: \(60 + 93 + 25 + 81 + 44 + 49 + 77 + 2 = 431\)

By trying to allocate items to balance these valuations, we can ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate items to maximize the minimum value received by both agents, considering their valuations.
   - Begin by assigning items with the largest difference in valuation between the two agents to the agent who values them more.

2. **Fair Allocation:**
   - Ensure both agents receive a balanced value in terms of their initial total valuations.

Let's go through the process:

- Items with the largest valuation differences:
  - Item 1: Agent 1 (93) vs. Agent 0 (21) → give to Agent 1.
  - Item 3: Agent 1 (81) vs. Agent 0 (56) → give to Agent 1.
  - Item 7: Agent 0 (22) vs. Agent 1 (2) → give to Agent 0.
  
- Remaining items:
  - Allocate based on remaining high valuations while ensuring total number of items is balanced.
  
- After initial allocations, check remaining items and distribute to balance value.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 4, 7] 
  - Total value: \(40 + 46 + 47 + 22 = 155\)

- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 5, 6]
  - Total value: \(93 + 81 + 49 + 77 = 300\)

This allocation minimizes envy by ensuring each agent receives a fair share relative to their total valuations.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are assigned, with each agent receiving 4 items, while striving for fairness based on their valuations.
