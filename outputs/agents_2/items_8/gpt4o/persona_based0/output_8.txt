Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3  4   5   6   7
0  99  96  22  12  6  55  98  93
1  69   1   4  47  4  92  16  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction of each agent. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they receive a fair share of the items based on their valuations. 

Let's start by computing the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 99 + 96 + 22 + 12 + 6 + 55 + 98 + 93 = 481
- Agent 1's total valuation: 69 + 1 + 4 + 47 + 4 + 92 + 16 + 46 = 279

Next, we will attempt to allocate the items in a manner that minimizes envy. One way to achieve this is by assigning items to agents in a manner where the difference in the sum of valuations is minimized between the two agents.

Let's consider allocating the items in the following way:

1. Assign items that are most valued by each agent to that agent:
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, 6, and 7.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 5 and 3.

2. Allocate the items step by step:
   - Assign items 0, 1, 6, and 7 to Agent 0.
   - Assign items 3 and 5 to Agent 1.

3. Distribute remaining items 2 and 4 to balance the total valuations:
   - Assign items 2 and 4 to Agent 0 as they are valued higher by Agent 0 than Agent 1.

Now we check the allocation:

- Agent 0's allocated items: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Agent 1's allocated items: 3, 5

Valuations:
- Agent 0's total valuation for their items: 99 + 96 + 22 + 6 + 98 + 93 = 414
- Agent 1's total valuation for their items: 47 + 92 = 139

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and attempts to minimize envy based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 5]
}
```
