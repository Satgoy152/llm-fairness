Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  76  31  14  81   9  82  90
1  58   2   0   7  21  10  54  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize their satisfaction. Here, we will aim for a balanced distribution based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4, 6, and 7.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 and 6.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Allocate to Agent 1 (58 vs 3) - Better for Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Allocate to Agent 0 (76 vs 2) - Better for Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Allocate to Agent 0 (31 vs 0) - Better for Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Allocate to Agent 0 (14 vs 7) - Better for Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Allocate to Agent 0 (81 vs 21) - Better for Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Allocate to Agent 1 (10 vs 9) - Slightly better for Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Allocate to Agent 1 (54 vs 82) - Better for Agent 1.
8. Item 7: Allocate to Agent 0 (90 vs 19) - Better for Agent 0.

Now we can present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers the higher preferences each agent has for the items and tries to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.
