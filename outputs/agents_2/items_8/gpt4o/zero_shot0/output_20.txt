Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  28  40  73  12  54  23  12
1  11  19  58   8  80  28  58  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can consider the valuations of each item for both agents. One potential method is to allocate items to the agent who values them more, while trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**:  
   - Agent 0: 17 + 28 + 40 + 73 + 12 + 54 + 23 + 12 = 259
   - Agent 1: 11 + 19 + 58 + 8 + 80 + 28 + 58 + 48 = 310

2. **Consider Individual Item Valuations**:  
   - Compare each item's valuation for both agents and allocate it to the agent who values it more.

3. **Allocate Items Based on Valuations**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (17 vs 11).
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (28 vs 19).
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (58 vs 40).
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (73 vs 8).
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (80 vs 12).
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (54 vs 28).
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (58 vs 23).
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (48 vs 12).

4. **Ensure Each Agent Gets an Integer Number of Items**:  
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3, 5]
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 4, 6, 7]

With these allocations, each agent gets 4 items, and the items are allocated based on which agent values them more.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
