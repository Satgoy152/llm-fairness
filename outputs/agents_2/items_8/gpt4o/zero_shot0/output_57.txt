Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  90  99  37  79  18  73  14
1  40  72  19  18   9  31  85  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction given their valuations. One common approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm where each agent is allocated the item they value the most, one at a time, until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0's Highest Valuation:**  
   - Item 2 (value 99)

2. **Agent 1's Highest Valuation:**  
   - Item 6 (value 85)

3. **Agent 0's Next Highest Valuation:**  
   - Item 1 (value 90)

4. **Agent 1's Next Highest Valuation:**  
   - Item 0 (value 40)

5. **Agent 0's Next Highest Valuation:**  
   - Item 4 (value 79)

6. **Agent 1's Next Highest Valuation:**  
   - Item 7 (value 60)

7. **Agent 0's Next Highest Valuation:**  
   - Item 3 (value 37)

8. **Agent 1's Next Highest Valuation:**  
   - Item 5 (value 31)

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest remaining valuations at each step. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 4, 3],
    "1": [6, 0, 7, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures both agents receive an integer number of items and attempts to balance the total valuation each receives.
