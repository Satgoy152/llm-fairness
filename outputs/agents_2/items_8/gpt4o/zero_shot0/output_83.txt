Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  74  79   3  52  78  61  23
1  77   4  67  25   0  63  10  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their satisfaction based on the given valuations, while also ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Value of item 0: 26
   - Value of item 1: 74
   - Value of item 2: 79
   - Value of item 3: 3
   - Value of item 4: 52
   - Value of item 5: 78
   - Value of item 6: 61
   - Value of item 7: 23

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Value of item 0: 77
   - Value of item 1: 4
   - Value of item 2: 67
   - Value of item 3: 25
   - Value of item 4: 0
   - Value of item 5: 63
   - Value of item 6: 10
   - Value of item 7: 77

Let's consider allocating based on maximizing the total value for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 2, 5, 6] (valuations: 74, 79, 78, 61)
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 3, 4, 7] (valuations: 77, 25, 0, 77)

This allocation gives:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 74 + 79 + 78 + 61 = 292
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 77 + 25 + 0 + 77 = 179

Therefore, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
