Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  87  56  81  67  34  43  68
1  72  29  61  71  60   8   8  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 29 61 71 60  8  8 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on the given valuations, we can use a greedy algorithm that allocates each item to the agent who values it the most. This method aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

Here is the allocation process:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it more.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the higher valuation.
3. If both agents value an item equally, the item can be assigned to either agent.

Let's go through the items one by one:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 at 72. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 at 29. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 at 61. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 at 71. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 67, Agent 1 at 60. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 at 8. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 at 8. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 at 63. Assign to Agent 0.

Based on this allocation process, the final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [2]
}
```
