Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  89  33  55   6  30  64  70
1  84  63  63  29  25  88  65  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 63 63 29 25 88 65 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to balance the total valuation for each agent. Here's one approach to achieve this:

First, calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 69 + 89 + 33 + 55 + 6 + 30 + 64 + 70 = 416
- Agent 1's total valuation: 84 + 63 + 63 + 29 + 25 + 88 + 65 + 79 = 496

Now, let's allocate the items to balance the total valuations as evenly as possible:

1. Assign items to the agent who values them more, while keeping track of the total valuation.
2. Re-adjust if necessary to balance the overall values more evenly.

Let's proceed with this method:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values this item more (84 vs 69), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values this item more (89 vs 63), assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Both agents value this equally (63), assign to any. Let's give it to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values this item more (55 vs 29), assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values this item more (6 vs 25), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values this item more (88 vs 30), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values this item more (65 vs 64), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values this item more (70 vs 79), assign to Agent 1.

Now let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 3] with values = 89 + 33 + 55 = 177
- Agent 1: Items [0, 4, 5, 6, 7] with values = 84 + 25 + 88 + 65 + 79 = 341

The allocation seems imbalanced. Let's try again to balance this:

Re-allocating to balance:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (84)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (89)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (63)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (55)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (25)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (88)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (64)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (70)

Recalculate:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 6, 7] with values = 89 + 55 + 64 + 70 = 278
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 4, 5] with values = 84 + 63 + 25 + 88 = 260

Final allocation is more balanced:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
