Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  68   3  81  75  74  61  45
1  37  82  13  57  32  69  94   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, one common approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the values each agent assigns to the items, we can use a simple greedy approach to allocate items in a manner that attempts to maximize the sum of values each agent receives.

First, let's sum the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 33 + 68 + 3 + 81 + 75 + 74 + 61 + 45 = 440
- Agent 1's total value: 37 + 82 + 13 + 57 + 32 + 69 + 94 + 0 = 384

Since Agent 0 has a higher total value, we can start by trying to give Agent 0 the items they value more. However, to make it fair, we will ensure that the allocation overall maximizes the value for both agents.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (37 vs 33)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (82 vs 68)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (13 vs 3)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (81 vs 57)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (75 vs 32)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (74 vs 69)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (94 vs 61)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (45 vs 0)

Now, let's ensure the allocation is balanced between the agents:

- Agent 0 receives items [3, 4, 5, 7]
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 1, 2, 6]

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0's total value: 81 + 75 + 74 + 45 = 275
- Agent 1's total value: 37 + 82 + 13 + 94 = 226

Given this allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes their respective total values while making a fairly balanced allocation, it seems reasonable.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6]
}
```
