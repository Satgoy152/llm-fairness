Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32   6  70   1   9  71  84  67
1  64  83  21  51  42  31   9  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach based on maximizing the total value each agent receives. One common method is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring both agents receive an equal number of items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuations, in descending order.
3. Assign each item to the agent who values it more until both agents have received 4 items each.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Differences in valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: |32 - 64| = 32
   - Item 1: |6 - 83| = 77
   - Item 2: |70 - 21| = 49
   - Item 3: |1 - 51| = 50
   - Item 4: |9 - 42| = 33
   - Item 5: |71 - 31| = 40
   - Item 6: |84 - 9| = 75
   - Item 7: |67 - 87| = 20

2. Sort items by the absolute difference in descending order and allocate to the agent with the higher valuation:
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (83)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (84)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (51)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (70)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (71)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (42)
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (64)
   - Item 7: Agent 1 (87)

3. Ensure both agents have an equal number of items:
   - Agent 0: [2, 5, 6]
   - Agent 1: [0, 1, 3, 4, 7]

Adjustments:
   - Move item 7 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 to balance the number of items.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```
