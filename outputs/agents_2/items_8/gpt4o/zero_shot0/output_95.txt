Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  21  96  21  86  87  71  32
1  48  20  32  70  59  81  31  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each item by both agents:
- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 34, Agent 1 values at 48
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 21, Agent 1 values at 20
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 96, Agent 1 values at 32
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 21, Agent 1 values at 70
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 86, Agent 1 values at 59
- Item 5: Agent 0 values at 87, Agent 1 values at 81
- Item 6: Agent 0 values at 71, Agent 1 values at 31
- Item 7: Agent 0 values at 32, Agent 1 values at 28

Next, we'll allocate items to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

1. Assign items to agents based on the highest value they give to each item.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure a fair distribution, attempting to equalize the total valuation each agent receives.

Allocations:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the total value each agent receives:
- Agent 0: 34 (Item 0) + 96 (Item 2) + 86 (Item 4) + 71 (Item 6) = 287
- Agent 1: 20 (Item 1) + 70 (Item 3) + 81 (Item 5) + 28 (Item 7) = 199

This initial distribution aims to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences. If a more equal distribution is desired, further adjustments can be made.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
