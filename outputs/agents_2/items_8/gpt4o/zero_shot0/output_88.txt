Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14   2  92  74  96  17  10  29
1  29  89  64  42  46  83  20  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. One approach is to use a method that maximizes the minimum satisfaction for each agent. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent if they receive all items:
   - Agent 0: 14 + 2 + 92 + 74 + 96 + 17 + 10 + 29 = 334
   - Agent 1: 29 + 89 + 64 + 42 + 46 + 83 + 20 + 56 = 429

2. Allocate items to balance the total valuation each agent receives:
   - Assign items to agents to balance their total values as closely as possible.

Here is a fair allocation based on the valuations:

- Agent 0 will receive items that collectively give them a fair share of the total value.
- Agent 1 will receive the remaining items.

After considering the values and trying to equalize the total value for each agent, the allocation can be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the valuation each agent receives, keeping the distribution fair based on their individual valuations for each item.
