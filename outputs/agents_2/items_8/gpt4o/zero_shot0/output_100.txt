Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  18  11  35  21  32  63  16
1  16  91  23  97   5  46   6  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation, ensuring that neither agent feels they are getting less value than the other. Given the valuations, we can apply a simple heuristic to ensure each agent gets a balanced and fair allocation.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (76), while agent 1 highly values item 3 (97).
2. Agent 1 values item 1 (91) much higher than agent 0 (18).
3. Agent 0 values items 4 (21) and 5 (32) more than agent 1 does.
4. Agent 1 values item 7 (84) significantly higher than agent 0 (16).
5. For items where the valuations are closer, we can try to balance the overall value.

Taking into account the distribution of preferences and trying to balance the total value, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 4, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: [1, 3, 7]

Now let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items in a manner that respects each agent's valuations and provides a balanced outcome.
