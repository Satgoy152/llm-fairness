Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  71  74  92  20  31  60  14
1   1  88  96  76  71  53  12  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 1 88 96 76 71 53 12 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to balance the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to ensure that the total valuation of the items each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Items: 0, 2, 3, 6
  - Total Value: 45 + 74 + 92 + 60 = 271

- Agent 1:
  - Items: 1, 4, 5, 7
  - Total Value: 88 + 71 + 53 + 17 = 229

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 271 and Agent 1 a total value of 229. Although it's not perfectly balanced, it is one of the fairer distributions considering the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
