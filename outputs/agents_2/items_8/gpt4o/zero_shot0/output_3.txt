Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  71  93  18  83  62  85  88
1  69  71  91  46  16  94  53  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [69 71 91 46 16 94 53 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, aiming to maximize the product of utilities received by each agent. This approach often results in a fair and efficient allocation.

Using the given valuations, we can proceed with a potential allocation that seems fair based on the values:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Value 39
   - Item 3: Value 18
   - Item 4: Value 83
   - Item 6: Value 85

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 1: Value 71
   - Item 2: Value 91
   - Item 5: Value 94
   - Item 7: Value 65

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value received by each agent, considering their individual valuations for each item.
