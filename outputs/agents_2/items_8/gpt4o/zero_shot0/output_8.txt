Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  51  44  38  25  16  96   4
1  74  60  23  33  20  45  66  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation. One simple method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's how the allocation breaks down:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 values it at 74. Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 values it at 60. Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 44, Agent 1 values it at 23. Assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 38, Agent 1 values it at 33. Assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 values it at 20. Assign to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 16, Agent 1 values it at 45. Assign to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 values it at 66. Assign to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 4, Agent 1 values it at 90. Assign to Agent 1.

Based on these valuations, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most.
