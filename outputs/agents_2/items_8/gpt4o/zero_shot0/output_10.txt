Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  44  76  10  17  37  31  21
1  24  40  26  63  92  57  78   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a method like the "Envy-Free" allocation or "Max-Min Fairness", but given the simplicity of this problem, we can manually allocate the items based on maximizing value per agent.

Let's look at the values each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0: [11, 44, 76, 10, 17, 37, 31, 21]
- Agent 1: [24, 40, 26, 63, 92, 57, 78, 2]

We'll start by allocating the items with the highest difference in value favoring one agent significantly over the other. This way, we can maximize the satisfaction of both agents.

1. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 92, while Agent 0 values it at 17. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 76, while Agent 1 values it at 26. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 78, while Agent 0 values it at 31. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 63, while Agent 0 values it at 10. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 57, while Agent 0 values it at 37. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 44, while Agent 1 values it at 40. Allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 24, while Agent 0 values it at 11. Allocate to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 21, while Agent 1 values it at 2. Allocate to Agent 0.

The allocation can be summarized as:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 7],
    "1": [4, 6, 3, 5, 0]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a nearly equal opportunity to maximize their total valuation based on their preferences.
