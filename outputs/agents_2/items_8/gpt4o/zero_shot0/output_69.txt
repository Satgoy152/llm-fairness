Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  56  57  60  43  21   8  83
1  54  13  96  31  37   5  50  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an approach that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each gets an integer number of items. A good strategy is to assign items based on the highest value difference between the agents for each item.

Here's the allocation process:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations between the two agents for each item.
2. Assign each item to the agent that values it more.

Let's compute the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 values it at 54. Difference = 71 - 54 = 17 (Assign to Agent 0)
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 values it at 13. Difference = 56 - 13 = 43 (Assign to Agent 0)
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 values it at 96. Difference = 96 - 57 = 39 (Assign to Agent 1)
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 values it at 31. Difference = 60 - 31 = 29 (Assign to Agent 0)
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 values it at 37. Difference = 43 - 37 = 6 (Assign to Agent 0)
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 values it at 5. Difference = 21 - 5 = 16 (Assign to Agent 0)
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 values it at 50. Difference = 50 - 8 = 42 (Assign to Agent 1)
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 83, Agent 1 values it at 56. Difference = 83 - 56 = 27 (Assign to Agent 0)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 6]
}
```
