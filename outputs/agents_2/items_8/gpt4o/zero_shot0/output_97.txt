Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  36  95   8  21  39  74  98
1  21   1  31  19  35  37  89   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can consider the total value each agent derives from the items and try to balance the allocation based on those values. The goal is to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as equal as possible.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 
  88 + 36 + 95 + 8 + 21 + 39 + 74 + 98 = 459

- Total valuation for Agent 1: 
  21 + 1 + 31 + 19 + 35 + 37 + 89 + 6 = 239

Since Agent 0 has higher total valuations for the items, they should receive items such that the total value they derive is close to the total value Agent 1 derives from their allocated items.

Let's allocate the items iteratively, aiming to balance the total valuations:

1. Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 95) and item 7 (value 98). Total for Agent 0: 95 + 98 = 193.
2. Agent 1 gets item 6 (value 89). Total for Agent 1: 89.

Continuing this process:

3. Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 88). Total for Agent 0: 193 + 88 = 281.
4. Agent 1 gets item 5 (value 37). Total for Agent 1: 89 + 37 = 126.

5. Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 36). Total for Agent 0: 281 + 36 = 317.
6. Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 35). Total for Agent 1: 126 + 35 = 161.

7. Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 8). Total for Agent 0: 317 + 8 = 325.
8. Agent 1 gets item 0 (value 21). Total for Agent 1: 161 + 21 = 182.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 7, 0, 1, 3
- Agent 1: Items 6, 5, 4

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 0, 1, 3],
    "1": [6, 5, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations that each agent derives from the items, given the constraint of integer allocations.
