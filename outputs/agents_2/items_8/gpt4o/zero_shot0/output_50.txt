Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80   7  55  34  37  72  26  49
1  59  14   4  83  56  82  95  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each gets an integer number of items. We can use a simple item-by-item allocation strategy, assigning each item to the agent who values it more, while also ensuring a balance in the number of items each receives.

Let's examine the valuations for each item and allocate them:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 values it at 59. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 7, Agent 1 values it at 14. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 values it at 4. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 values it at 83. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 values it at 56. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 values it at 82. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 values it at 95. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 values it at 21. Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, we need to ensure the number of items each agent receives is balanced. Here, Agent 0 receives 3 items and Agent 1 receives 5 items. Since Agent 1 has higher valuations for most items, this allocation seems fair in terms of maximizing total utility.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
