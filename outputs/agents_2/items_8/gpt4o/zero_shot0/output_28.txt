Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23   4  95   8  83  85  89  97
1  68  80  61  61   9  67  86  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to distribute the items:

1. **Initial Analysis**: 
   - Agent 0 has higher valuations for items 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
   - Agent 1 has higher valuations for items 0, 1, and 3.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign items where each agent has a significantly higher valuation than the other first.
   - Then, balance the remaining items based on the overall valuation.

3. **Step-by-Step Allocation**:
   - **Agent 0**:
     - Item 2 (95 vs 61)
     - Item 4 (83 vs 9)
     - Item 5 (85 vs 67)
     - Item 6 (89 vs 86)
     - Item 7 (97 vs 17)
   - **Agent 1**:
     - Item 0 (23 vs 68)
     - Item 1 (4 vs 80)
     - Item 3 (8 vs 61)

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives items where they have a stronger preference.
   - Agent 1 receives items where they have a stronger preference.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents get a fair share of items based on their valuations.
