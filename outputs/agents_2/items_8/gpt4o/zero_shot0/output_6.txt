Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  34  68  55  72  70  98   8
1   7  20   0  18  95  65  57  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. This approach attempts to balance the distribution of items based on their respective valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 has a higher valuation for most items except item 7.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for items 4, 5, 7.

Based on these observations, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. Allocate items with high values for Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3, 6.
2. Allocate items with high values for Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 5, 7.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent the items they value the most while ensuring both agents get an equal number of items.
