Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  40  93  78  84  95  51  61
1  77  65  62  58  84  69  91  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 65 62 58 84 69 91 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Let's calculate the total values each agent assigns to all items and then allocate items to balance these values as closely as possible.

Here are the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 57 + 40 + 93 + 78 + 84 + 95 + 51 + 61 = 559
- Agent 1: 77 + 65 + 62 + 58 + 84 + 69 + 91 + 34 = 540

The goal is to distribute the items such that the total valuation each agent receives is as close as possible. Let's use a simple allocation method to achieve this.

1. Pair the items with the difference in value between the two agents.
2. Allocate items starting with the largest difference to the agent who values it more until all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (77 vs 57).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (65 vs 40).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (93 vs 62).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (78 vs 58).
- Item 4: Both agents value equally (84), default to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (95 vs 69).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (91 vs 51).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (61 vs 34).

Final allocation based on maximizing individual satisfaction:

- Agent 0: [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 6]

JSON format allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 6]
}
```
