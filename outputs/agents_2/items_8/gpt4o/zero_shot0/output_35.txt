Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  70  25  51  11  80   2  54
1  71  87  89  43  95   3  22  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach that ensures each agent receives an integer number of items while attempting to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation process:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 5.
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2, 4, and 1.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - We'll attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly, balancing the overall valuation between the agents.

3. **Step-by-Step Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it at 87, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 70).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it at 80, significantly higher than Agent 1's valuation of 3).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it at 89, significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation of 25).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it at 95, significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation of 11).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (since the remaining items need to balance the count, and Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it even though it's low, balancing item count).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (to equalize the number of items).

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Each agent receives 4 items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 7]
}
```
