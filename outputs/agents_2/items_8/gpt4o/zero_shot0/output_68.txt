Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  69  40  17  72  68  35  76
1  53  98  84  65  25   3  62   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, I'll use a method that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives four items, as there are eight items in total.

1. **Evaluate each item's value for each agent:**

   Agent 0: 
   - Item 0: 3
   - Item 1: 69
   - Item 2: 40
   - Item 3: 17
   - Item 4: 72
   - Item 5: 68
   - Item 6: 35
   - Item 7: 76

   Agent 1: 
   - Item 0: 53
   - Item 1: 98
   - Item 2: 84
   - Item 3: 65
   - Item 4: 25
   - Item 5: 3
   - Item 6: 62
   - Item 7: 2

2. **Allocate items to each agent to maximize their total value:**

   - **Agent 0's top values:** Item 7 (76), Item 4 (72), Item 1 (69), Item 5 (68)
   - **Agent 1's top values:** Item 1 (98), Item 2 (84), Item 3 (65), Item 0 (53)

3. **Resolve conflicts and finalize allocations:**

   Since both agents highly value Item 1, prioritize it for Agent 1 due to its higher value to them. As a result, Agent 0 can be assigned items that are next in their preference list.

   Final allocation:
   - Agent 0: Items [7, 4, 5, 6]
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 3, 0]

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 0]
}
```
