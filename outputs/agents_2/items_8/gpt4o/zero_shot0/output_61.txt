Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  39  59  96  49  75  59  71
1  60   2  99   2  15  67   7  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we strive for an allocation that balances the total valuations for each agent as evenly as possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Aim to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is as close as possible.

Let's start by calculating the total valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 32 + 39 + 59 + 96 + 49 + 75 + 59 + 71 = 480
- Agent 1's total valuation: 60 + 2 + 99 + 2 + 15 + 67 + 7 + 61 = 313

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent until the total valuation is balanced.
2. Adjust if needed to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

By trial and error, we can find an allocation that balances the valuations between the agents:

- Assign items [0, 3, 4, 5, 6] to Agent 0.
- Assign items [1, 2, 7] to Agent 1.

Valuations after allocation:
- Agent 0: 32 (item 0) + 96 (item 3) + 49 (item 4) + 75 (item 5) + 59 (item 6) = 311
- Agent 1: 39 (item 1) + 99 (item 2) + 71 (item 7) = 209

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations, balancing the total value across both agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 7]
}
```
