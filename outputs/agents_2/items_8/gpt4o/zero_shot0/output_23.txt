Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70   6  95  70  33  13  11  93
1   1  79  50  56   8  49  79  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. A common approach to achieve this is using the "greedy" method, where items are allocated to the agent who values them the most, one by one.

Here is how we can allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.

Let's go through each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 values it at 1. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 values it at 79. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 values it at 50. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 values it at 56. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 33, Agent 1 values it at 8. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 values it at 49. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 11, Agent 1 values it at 79. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 values it at 28. Assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation aims to maximize the value each agent receives based on their respective valuations.
