Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  34   5  75  93   6  37  53
1  89  13  11  14  91  65  84  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the total value each agent assigns to the items and try to balance the allocations so each agent gets a fair share of the total value. We'll aim for an allocation where the total value assigned to each agent is as balanced as possible.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value for all items: \(3 + 34 + 5 + 75 + 93 + 6 + 37 + 53 = 306\)
- Agent 1's total value for all items: \(89 + 13 + 11 + 14 + 91 + 65 + 84 + 53 = 420\)

Now, let's try to allocate the items to balance these total values:

1. Assign items to agent 0 in a way that maximizes their value, while considering agent 1's valuations as well.
2. Assign the remaining items to agent 1.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 will get items: 3, 4, 5
  - Total value for agent 0: \(75 + 93 + 6 = 174\)
- Agent 1 will get items: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7
  - Total value for agent 1: \(89 + 13 + 11 + 84 + 53 = 250\)

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations as much as possible given the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6, 7]
}
```
