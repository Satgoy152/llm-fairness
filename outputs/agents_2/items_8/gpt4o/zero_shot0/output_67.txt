Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  30  34  56  86  58  38  82
1  49  65  58  17   2  41  66  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. This can be approached as an optimization problem where we try to balance the total valuation each agent gets.

Let's consider a simple approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 49; Agent 0 values it at 24. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 65; Agent 0 values it at 30. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 58; Agent 0 values it at 34. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 56; Agent 1 values it at 17. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 86; Agent 1 values it at 2. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 58; Agent 1 values it at 41. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 66; Agent 0 values it at 38. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 82; Agent 1 values it at 71. Assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations of the items.
