Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73   1   2  26  11  75  74  23
1  66  65  37  39  26  57  19  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple algorithm that ensures each agent receives a relatively balanced value from their allocated items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuation difference between the two agents.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the allocation process:

1. Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute difference in descending order.
3. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more, while keeping track of the total value for each agent.
4. Ensure that both agents receive four items each.

Let's go through the allocation process:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value | Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| 0    | 73            | 66            | 7                              |
| 1    | 1             | 65            | -64                            |
| 2    | 2             | 37            | -35                            |
| 3    | 26            | 39            | -13                            |
| 4    | 11            | 26            | -15                            |
| 5    | 75            | 57            | 18                             |
| 6    | 74            | 19            | 55                             |
| 7    | 23            | 87            | -64                            |

Sorted by absolute difference:

1. Item 1: Difference -64
2. Item 7: Difference -64
3. Item 2: Difference -35
4. Item 4: Difference -15
5. Item 3: Difference -13
6. Item 6: Difference 55
7. Item 5: Difference 18
8. Item 0: Difference 7

Allocating items:

- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (74)
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (75)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (73)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (26)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (39)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (37)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (65)
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 1 (87)

Now, let's ensure both agents receive four items. Swap items if necessary to balance the count:

Initial allocation based on value:
- Agent 0: [6, 5, 0]
- Agent 1: [1, 7, 2, 4, 3]

To balance:
- Move Item 3 from Agent 1 to Agent 0

Balanced allocation:
- Agent 0: [6, 5, 0, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 7, 2, 4]

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 0, 3],
    "1": [1, 7, 2, 4]
}
```
