Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  94  74  78  42   9  27  23
1  29  45   7  10  76  22  22  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use an approach to balance the total valuations each agent receives. Here's one way to do it:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0: 67 + 94 + 74 + 78 + 42 + 9 + 27 + 23 = 414
   - Agent 1: 29 + 45 + 7 + 10 + 76 + 22 + 22 + 99 = 310

2. We aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation each agent receives is as balanced as possible, given the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items.

3. We can achieve a balanced allocation by examining the value each agent places on each item and attempting to even out the total valuation. Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 should get items with high values for them and low values for Agent 1, and vice versa.

Let's allocate:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 4, 7

4. Calculate the total valuation of each agent for their allocated items:
   - Agent 0: 67 (item 0) + 94 (item 1) + 9 (item 5) + 27 (item 6) = 197
   - Agent 1: 74 (item 2) + 78 (item 3) + 76 (item 4) + 99 (item 7) = 327

This allocation tries to balance the valuations as evenly as possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
