Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  64  92  48   1  57  32  24
1  94  43  98  66  52  28  86  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 43 98 66 52 28 86 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for both agents while trying to distribute the items as evenly as possible. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item by both agents to understand the preferences.
2. Assign items to the agent who values them more, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Based on the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values items: 
  - 0: 61
  - 1: 64
  - 2: 92
  - 3: 48
  - 4: 1
  - 5: 57
  - 6: 32
  - 7: 24

- Agent 1 values items:
  - 0: 94
  - 1: 43
  - 2: 98
  - 3: 66
  - 4: 52
  - 5: 28
  - 6: 86
  - 7: 27

Now, let's allocate items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (94 vs 61), so it goes to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (64 vs 43), so it goes to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (98 vs 92), so it goes to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (66 vs 48), so it goes to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (52 vs 1), so it goes to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (57 vs 28), so it goes to Agent 0.
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (86 vs 32), so it goes to Agent 1.
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (27 vs 24), so it goes to Agent 1.

However, since Agent 1 ends up with more items, we'll need to adjust to ensure a fair distribution:

- Move Item 4 to Agent 0 to balance the number of items, as Agent 0 initially received fewer items. This maintains fairness by balancing the number of items each agent receives.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the distribution is adjusted for fairness based on the number of items.
