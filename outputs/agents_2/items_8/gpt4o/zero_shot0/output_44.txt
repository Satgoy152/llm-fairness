Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22   8  90   0  79  86  25  46
1  56  39  93  36  67  31  50  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple allocation method where each agent gets the items based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets an equal or nearly equal number of items. Here, there are 8 items and 2 agents, so ideally, each agent should get 4 items. 

Let's calculate the allocation step by step:

1. **Agent 0's valuations**: 22, 8, 90, 0, 79, 86, 25, 46
2. **Agent 1's valuations**: 56, 39, 93, 36, 67, 31, 50, 44

Sort the items based on the difference in valuations between the agents:

- Item 2: Difference = 93 - 90 = 3 (Agent 1 has a higher valuation)
- Item 5: Difference = 31 - 86 = -55 (Agent 0 has a higher valuation)
- Item 4: Difference = 67 - 79 = -12 (Agent 0 has a higher valuation)
- Item 0: Difference = 56 - 22 = 34 (Agent 1 has a higher valuation)
- Item 6: Difference = 50 - 25 = 25 (Agent 1 has a higher valuation)
- Item 7: Difference = 44 - 46 = -2 (Agent 0 has a higher valuation)
- Item 1: Difference = 39 - 8 = 31 (Agent 1 has a higher valuation)
- Item 3: Difference = 36 - 0 = 36 (Agent 1 has a higher valuation)

Allocate items to balance the number of items each agent receives:

- Agent 1 gets items with the highest positive differences: 2, 0, 6, 1
- Agent 0 gets the rest: 5, 4, 7, 3

Thus, the fair allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 7, 3],
    "1": [2, 0, 6, 1]
}
```
