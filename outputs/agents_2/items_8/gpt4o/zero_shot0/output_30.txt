Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  97  71  27  65   1   1  32
1  17  23  90  95  70  85  70  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use the "greedy" method, where we assign each item to the agent who values it more until all items are allocated. Let's go through this process:

1. Create a list of items with their respective valuations by the two agents.
2. Sort this list in descending order based on the difference in valuations between the two agents.
3. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.

Let's apply this method to the given table:

| Item | Agent 0 Valuation | Agent 1 Valuation | Difference (Agent 1 - Agent 0) |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1    | 97                | 23                | -74                            |
| 0    | 78                | 17                | -61                            |
| 2    | 71                | 90                | 19                             |
| 4    | 65                | 70                | 5                              |
| 3    | 27                | 95                | 68                             |
| 7    | 32                | 46                | 14                             |
| 5    | 1                 | 85                | 84                             |
| 6    | 1                 | 70                | 69                             |

Now, allocate each item to the agent who values it more:

- Item 1: Agent 0 (97 > 23)
- Item 0: Agent 0 (78 > 17)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (90 > 71)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (70 > 65)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (95 > 27)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (46 > 32)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (85 > 1)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (70 > 1)

After assigning items, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
