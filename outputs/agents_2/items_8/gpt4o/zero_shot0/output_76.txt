Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  42  13  10  49  51  62  70
1  49  74  44  35  14  59  43  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction of each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a method like "round-robin" or "envy-free" allocation, but given the specific context, let's attempt a direct allocation based on maximizing individual preference.

Let's begin by allocating the items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that both agents receive four items each.

### Initial Allocation Strategy:

1. Compare the value each agent assigns to each item.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
3. Adjust to ensure each agent ends up with four items, as there are eight items in total.

### Allocation Process:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 49, higher than Agent 0's 40, so assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 74, higher than Agent 0's 42, so assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 44, higher than Agent 0's 13, so assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 10, higher than Agent 1's 35, so assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 49, higher than Agent 1's 14, so assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 51, higher than Agent 1's 59, so assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 62, higher than Agent 1's 43, so assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it at 85, higher than Agent 0's 70, so assign to Agent 1.

### Adjustments:

Currently, Agent 1 has 5 items (0, 1, 2, 5, 7) and Agent 0 has 3 items (3, 4, 6). To ensure each agent has 4 items, we need to swap one item from Agent 1 to Agent 0. The item with the smallest value difference that Agent 0 values more than Agent 1 is Item 5.

- **Swap Item 5**: Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.

Now, Agent 0 has items (3, 4, 5, 6) and Agent 1 has items (0, 1, 2, 7).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives four items, and the distribution is based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive.
