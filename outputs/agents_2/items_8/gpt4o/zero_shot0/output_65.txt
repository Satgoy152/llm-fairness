Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  99  75  68  72  56  64  20
1   7  97  61   7  46  51  93  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuation difference between the two agents. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute difference of valuations in descending order.
3. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's the process for the given data:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value | Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| 0    | 48            | 7             | 41                             |
| 1    | 99            | 97            | 2                              |
| 2    | 75            | 61            | 14                             |
| 3    | 68            | 7             | 61                             |
| 4    | 72            | 46            | 26                             |
| 5    | 56            | 51            | 5                              |
| 6    | 64            | 93            | -29                            |
| 7    | 20            | 39            | -19                            |

Sort the items by the absolute difference:

1. Item 3: Difference = 61
2. Item 0: Difference = 41
3. Item 4: Difference = 26
4. Item 2: Difference = 14
5. Item 1: Difference = 2
6. Item 5: Difference = 5
7. Item 7: Difference = -19
8. Item 6: Difference = -29

Allocate based on who values each item more:

- Agent 0: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Agent 1: 5, 6, 7

Now, the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
