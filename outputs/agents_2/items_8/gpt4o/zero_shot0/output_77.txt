Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  20  21  25   6  76  53  48
1  52  23  18  42  91  68  99  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We can achieve this by comparing the values each agent assigns to each item and assigning items to the agent with the higher valuation. However, we must ensure that each agent receives four items, as there are eight items in total.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to the agent who values them more, while ensuring each agent receives exactly four items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 at 52. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 at 23. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 at 18. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 at 42. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 at 91. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 68. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 at 99. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 48, Agent 1 at 93. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, count the items each agent receives:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 5, (needs one more item)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 (has one extra item)

To balance, we need to move one item from Agent 1 to Agent 0. We can choose Item 5, where Agent 0 has a slightly higher valuation.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 5, 7
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 4, 6

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
