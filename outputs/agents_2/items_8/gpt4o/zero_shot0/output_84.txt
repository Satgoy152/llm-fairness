Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  25  32  37  60  73  90  38
1  98  12  65  74   9  24  11  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will use a strategy that tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0 total valuation: \(16 + 25 + 32 + 37 + 60 + 73 + 90 + 38 = 371\)
- Agent 1 total valuation: \(98 + 12 + 65 + 74 + 9 + 24 + 11 + 15 = 308\)

Now, let's try to allocate items in a way that balances the total valuation each agent receives. One approach is to assign items based on which agent values them more, while trying to keep the number of items each agent receives balanced.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Items with higher value for Agent 0 compared to Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Items with higher or equal value for Agent 1 compared to Agent 0: Items 0, 3

Now let's allocate based on the above analysis:

- Agent 0: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of: \(25 + 32 + 60 + 73 + 90 + 38 = 318\)
This allocation gives Agent 1 a total valuation of: \(98 + 74 = 172\)

While this allocation might not perfectly balance the total valuation, it ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items. The distribution can be adjusted further if needed to better balance the valuations, but given the stark differences in preferences, this might be a reasonable allocation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
