Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98   1  97  47  61  46  37  31
1  62  44  96  99  21  51  86  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that maximizes the total satisfaction of the agents. One method to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's allocate the items accordingly:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it more.
2. Assign the item to that agent.

Let's proceed with this method for the given table:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 values it at 62. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 1, Agent 1 values it at 44. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 values it at 96. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 values it at 99. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 21. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 46, Agent 1 values it at 51. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 values it at 86. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 31, Agent 1 values it at 84. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's represent the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it most, aiming to maximize overall satisfaction.
