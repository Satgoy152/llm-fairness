Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  53  29  42  96  63  50  10
1  30  79  11   4  56  72  46  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use an approach that tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives. One such method is a greedy allocation based on maximizing the difference in value for each item between the two agents. Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Calculate the value difference for each item between the agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuations, in descending order.
3. Allocate items one by one, starting from the one with the highest difference, to the agent who values it more, taking care to balance the total number of items allocated to each agent.

Below is the calculation and allocation process:

1. Calculate the value difference for each item:
   - Item 0: |46 - 30| = 16
   - Item 1: |53 - 79| = 26
   - Item 2: |29 - 11| = 18
   - Item 3: |42 - 4| = 38
   - Item 4: |96 - 56| = 40
   - Item 5: |63 - 72| = 9
   - Item 6: |50 - 46| = 4
   - Item 7: |10 - 53| = 43

2. Sort items by the absolute difference in descending order:
   - Item 7 (43), Item 4 (40), Item 3 (38), Item 1 (26), Item 2 (18), Item 0 (16), Item 5 (9), Item 6 (4)

3. Allocate items:
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 1 (higher value: 53)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (higher value: 96)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (higher value: 42)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (higher value: 79)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (higher value: 29)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (higher value: 46)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 (higher value: 72)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0 (higher value: 50)

Final allocations:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 5, 7

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 5, 7]
}
```
