Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  97  56  33  92  20  71  53
1  45   7  31  32  50  56   7  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- For Agent 0:
  - Total Value = 68 + 97 + 56 + 33 + 92 + 20 + 71 + 53 = 490

- For Agent 1:
  - Total Value = 45 + 7 + 31 + 32 + 50 + 56 + 7 + 31 = 259

Now, we should allocate items in a way that tries to balance the total value received by each agent. A possible allocation strategy could be to give Agent 0 the items they value more highly and Agent 1 the items they value less, but we also need to ensure an approximately equal number of items are allocated to each agent.

One feasible allocation could be:

Agent 0: Assign items that Agent 0 has higher valuations for, balancing the total value:
- Items: 0, 1, 4, 6

Agent 1: Assign the remaining items:
- Items: 2, 3, 5, 7

Let's summarize this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation provides a fair division based on the relative valuations of the items by each agent.
