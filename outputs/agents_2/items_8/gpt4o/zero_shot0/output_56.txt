Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  31   4   0  43  46  88  75
1  79  67  76  20   3  91  96  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. A common strategy for this kind of problem is to use an algorithm like the "Greedy Allocation" method, which iteratively assigns items to agents based on the highest value preference until all items are allocated. Below is one possible allocation:

1. Start by listing the value each agent has for each item:
   - Agent 0: [31, 31, 4, 0, 43, 46, 88, 75]
   - Agent 1: [79, 67, 76, 20, 3, 91, 96, 58]

2. For each item, check which agent values it more and allocate the item to that agent.
3. If both agents value an item equally, allocate it to the agent with the lesser total valuation so far to balance out the allocation.

Following this method, here's a possible allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (79 vs 31)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (67 vs 31)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (76 vs 4)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (20 vs 0)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (43 vs 3)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (91 vs 46)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (96 vs 88)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (75 vs 58)

Resulting Allocation:
- Agent 0: [4, 7]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6]

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents get items, and attempts to maximize the valuation each agent receives based on their preferences.
