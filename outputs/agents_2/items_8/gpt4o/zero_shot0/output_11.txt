Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  59  20   2  70  97  43  47
1  13  30  51  87  93  97   6  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy method, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it more, provided it helps balance the number of items each agent receives.

Let's evaluate the allocation:

1. We compare the valuations of each item by both agents:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 at 13.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 at 30.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 at 51.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 2,  Agent 1 at 87.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 at 93.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 at 97.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 at 6.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 at 35.

2. Allocate items based on higher valuations while ensuring a fair number of items:

- Items most valued by Agent 0: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7
- Items most valued by Agent 1: 2, 3, 4

To ensure a fair allocation (4 items each), we may need to adjust slightly to balance the number of items:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 4, 7]

This allocation balances the number of items and allocates each item to the agent who values it most or ensures a fair distribution.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
