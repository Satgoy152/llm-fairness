Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  43   8  94  61  91  85   4
1  40  85  93  95  91  61  76  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that tries to balance the total value of items assigned to each agent. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that allocates items based on maximizing the current difference in total valuation until all items are allocated.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive no items:
- Agent 0: 0
- Agent 1: 0

Then, we proceed by iteratively assigning each item to the agent for whom it results in the least increase in the current imbalance in total valuation, aiming to keep the valuations as balanced as possible.

Here is how we can allocate the items:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (95) to start strong.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (50).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (85).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (61).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (93).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (91).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (85).
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (53).

After this allocation, the total values for each agent will be balanced as follows:
- Agent 0: 50 + 61 + 91 + 85 = 287
- Agent 1: 95 + 85 + 93 + 53 = 326

It seems that the allocation can be adjusted to better balance the valuations. Let's make a better allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (94).
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (91).
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (91).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (40).
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (43).
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (93).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (85).
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (53).

Now, the total valuations are:
- Agent 0: 94 + 91 + 43 + 85 = 313
- Agent 1: 91 + 40 + 93 + 53 = 277

The allocation is close to balanced. Based on this approach, here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 1, 6],
    "1": [4, 0, 2, 7]
}
```
