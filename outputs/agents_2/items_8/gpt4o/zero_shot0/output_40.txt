Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  74  63  35  78  44  22  46
1  73  86   4  35  69  49  28  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll use a strategy that tries to balance the total value of items each agent receives. This is a simple approach that doesn't guarantee absolute fairness but strives to distribute items in a way that considers each agent's valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and then allocate items to balance these totals as much as possible:

Agent 0 total valuation:  
72 + 74 + 63 + 35 + 78 + 44 + 22 + 46 = 434

Agent 1 total valuation:  
73 + 86 + 4 + 35 + 69 + 49 + 28 + 70 = 414

Now, let's allocate items to balance the total valuation:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (86), because it is highly valued by Agent 1.
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (72), because it is highly valued by Agent 0.
3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (78), as Agent 0 values it highly.
4. Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (70), since Agent 1 values it highly.
5. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (49), considering Agent 1's higher valuation.
6. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (63), for higher valuation.
7. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (35), as both value it equally, but helps balance.
8. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (28), as Agent 1 values it slightly more.

After allocation, we have:

Agent 0: 0, 4, 2  
Agent 1: 1, 7, 5, 3, 6

Now, let's present the allocation in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.
