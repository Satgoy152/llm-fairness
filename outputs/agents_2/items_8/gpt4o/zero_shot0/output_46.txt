Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  60  57  22   8  50  81  29
1  47  86  92  66  81  89  39  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can try to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. A simple approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items based on the relative preferences of the agents. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items by this difference in descending order.
3. Allocate the items to the agents one by one, starting with the item that has the highest difference, to the agent who values it more unless it results in an imbalance in the number of items.

Let's assign the items based on the approach above:

- Item 2: Agent 1 values it higher (92 vs 57), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it higher (86 vs 60), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it higher (81 vs 39), assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it higher (89 vs 50), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it higher (66 vs 22), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it higher (47 vs 33), assign to Agent 0 to balance.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it higher (81 vs 8), assign to Agent 0 to balance.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it higher (29 vs 27), assign to Agent 0.

With this allocation, Agent 0 and Agent 1 both get 4 items each. Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive an equal number of items while also considering their preferences.
