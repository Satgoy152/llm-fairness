Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  99  79  13  49  19  92  45
1   1  49   9  25  86  17  53  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. This can be done by considering the highest value each agent places on the items and trying to balance these values.

Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations to ensure each agent receives a significant portion of their highest valued items.
2. Balance the remaining items to ensure a fair distribution of total values.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0:
- 0: 82
- 1: 99
- 2: 79
- 3: 13
- 4: 49
- 5: 19
- 6: 92
- 7: 45

Agent 1:
- 0: 1
- 1: 49
- 2: 9
- 3: 25
- 4: 86
- 5: 17
- 6: 53
- 7: 99

To maximize fairness, we should prioritize assigning each agent the items they value most highly:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 and item 6 very highly.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 and item 4 highly.

By examining the preferences, we can make the following allocations which balance the overall values:

- Assign items 0, 1, 2, 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 3, 4, 5, 7 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives:

Agent 0 total value: 82 + 99 + 79 + 92 = 352
Agent 1 total value: 25 + 86 + 17 + 99 = 227

Now, we present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation is one way to fairly distribute the items based on the given valuations and ensures each agent receives a significant portion of their highest-valued items.
