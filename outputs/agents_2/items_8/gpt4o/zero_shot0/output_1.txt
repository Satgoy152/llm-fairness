Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  89  65  13  17  82  10  45
1  34  16  75  10  88  64  51  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. One common method for achieving this is by using a modified version of the "Knapsack problem," which ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's first calculate the total value of items for each agent if they were to receive all items:

- Agent 0: 80 + 89 + 65 + 13 + 17 + 82 + 10 + 45 = 401
- Agent 1: 34 + 16 + 75 + 10 + 88 + 64 + 51 + 28 = 366

Since there are 8 items, a possible fair allocation would give 4 items to each agent, aiming to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Let's adopt the strategy of assigning items to agents based on the differences in their valuations, aiming to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent ends up with 4 items.

Here is one potential allocation:

- Assign items based on differences in valuation and ensuring equal number of items:
  - Agent 0 receives items with higher relative value differences favoring them.
  - Agent 1 receives items with higher relative value differences favoring them.

Allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 5, 7]
  - Total value: 80 + 89 + 82 + 45 = 296
- Agent 1: [2, 3, 4, 6]
  - Total value: 75 + 10 + 88 + 51 = 224

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets 4 items.
