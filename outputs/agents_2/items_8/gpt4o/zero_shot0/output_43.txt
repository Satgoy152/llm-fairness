Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  98  77  35  32  48  48  64
1  47  75  65  57  85  39  96  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. One common method for achieving this is to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their total value from the items they receive compared to the other agent. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent:

   - Agent 0 total valuation: 22 + 98 + 77 + 35 + 32 + 48 + 48 + 64 = 424
   - Agent 1 total valuation: 47 + 75 + 65 + 57 + 85 + 39 + 96 + 83 = 547

2. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Let's distribute the items to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

3. Allocate items based on the highest individual item valuation for each agent:

   - Agent 1 values item 6 the most (96), so allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (98), so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Continue allocating items that provide the highest marginal increase in each agent's total valuation.
   
4. Based on the above approach, here is one possible allocation:

   - Agent 0: [1, 2, 3, 5]
   - Agent 1: [0, 4, 6, 7]

Hereâ€™s the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly maximize the total valuation each agent receives.
