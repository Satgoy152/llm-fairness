Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  82   5  84  82   4  78  38
1  67  85  91  48  48  15  10  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total satisfaction or valuation for both agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items:
   - Agent 0: 93 + 82 + 5 + 84 + 82 + 4 + 78 + 38 = 466
   - Agent 1: 67 + 85 + 91 + 48 + 48 + 15 + 10 + 62 = 426

2. Aim to distribute items such that each agent gets a fair share of the total value based on their preferences. A fair allocation could be one where each agent receives half of the items (4 items each), attempting to maximize their satisfaction.

3. To achieve this, consider the valuations and try to allocate items to maximize each agent's total value:

   - Assign the highest-value items to each agent in turns, ensuring each agent ends up with 4 items.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values items: (0: 93), (3: 84), (1: 82), (4: 82) highest.
- Agent 1 values items: (2: 91), (1: 85), (7: 62), (0: 67) highest.

Given the above, a fair distribution could be:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: [2, 5, 6, 7]

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations each agent receives.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 7]
}
```
