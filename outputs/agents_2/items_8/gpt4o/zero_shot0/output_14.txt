Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55   9  47  11  21   6  71  32
1  71  41  90  96   8  19  18   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. This can be approached by considering the valuations each agent has for each item and trying to balance the total value of items allocated to each agent.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent and then allocate items to maximize fairness:

Agent 0 Valuations:
- Item 0: 55
- Item 1: 9
- Item 2: 47
- Item 3: 11
- Item 4: 21
- Item 5: 6
- Item 6: 71
- Item 7: 32

Agent 1 Valuations:
- Item 0: 71
- Item 1: 41
- Item 2: 90
- Item 3: 96
- Item 4: 8
- Item 5: 19
- Item 6: 18
- Item 7: 6

To allocate items fairly, we will try to give each agent the items they value the most, ensuring each agent gets 4 items (since there are 8 items and 2 agents).

1. Sort items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents. This will help in prioritizing items that are strongly preferred by one agent over the other.

2. Allocate items to the agent who values them more, attempting to balance the total value.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- Agent 1 could get items: 2, 3, 0, 5
- Agent 0 could get items: 6, 7, 4, 1

This is based on maximizing the valuation for each agent while maintaining a fair distribution of items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 4, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items that they highly value, creating a fair distribution based on their respective valuations.
