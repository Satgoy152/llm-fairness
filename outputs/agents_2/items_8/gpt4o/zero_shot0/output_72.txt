Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  12  98  65  95   2  75  46
1  10  36  45  16  85  69  11  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple heuristic method like maximizing the total value each agent receives. One common strategy is to allocate items greedily based on which agent values them more, while ensuring both agents receive an equal number of items (since there are 8 items, each agent should get 4 items).

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Compare the valuations for each item and allocate the item to the agent with the higher valuation.
2. Ensure that each agent receives exactly 4 items. If necessary, adjust allocations to balance the number of items each agent receives, while trying to maintain the highest possible valuation for each agent.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 values it at 10. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 values it at 36. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 values it at 45. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 values it at 16. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 values it at 85. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 values it at 69. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 values it at 11. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 46, Agent 1 values it at 37. Allocate to Agent 0.

After initial allocation, Agent 0 has 6 items and Agent 1 has 2 items. We need to rebalance:

- Move Item 6 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it less, but this balances the count).
- Move Item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it less, but this balances the count).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 2, 3, 7]
- Agent 1 receives items: [1, 4, 5, 6]

    "1": [1, 4, 5, 6]
