Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  11  26  56  22  55  93  27
1  47  19  83  69  89  69  16  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 19 83 69 89 69 16 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0's valuations: [88, 11, 26, 56, 22, 55, 93, 27]
- Agent 1's valuations: [47, 19, 83, 69, 89, 69, 16, 61]

Let's allocate the items to maximize fairness:

1. Allocate item 0 to agent 0: (88 vs 47) - higher value for agent 0.
2. Allocate item 1 to agent 1: (11 vs 19) - higher value for agent 1.
3. Allocate item 2 to agent 1: (26 vs 83) - higher value for agent 1.
4. Allocate item 3 to agent 1: (56 vs 69) - higher value for agent 1.
5. Allocate item 4 to agent 1: (22 vs 89) - higher value for agent 1.
6. Allocate item 5 to agent 0: (55 vs 69) - trying to balance allocation since agent 0 has fewer items.
7. Allocate item 6 to agent 0: (93 vs 16) - higher value for agent 0.
8. Allocate item 7 to agent 0: (27 vs 61) - trying to balance allocation since agent 0 has fewer items.

Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
