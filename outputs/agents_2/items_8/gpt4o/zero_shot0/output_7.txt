Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  60  66  56  36  93  71  30
1  52  48  26  23   5  91  33  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to balance the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, but we must ensure that both agents receive an approximately equal number of items.

Let's go through the allocation process step-by-step:

1. **Initial Allocation**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, keeping track of the number of items each agent receives.

2. **Adjust for Fairness**: If any agent receives more items than the other, adjust the allocation by reallocating some items from the agent with more items to the one with fewer items, prioritizing items with the smallest value difference between agents.

Applying this method to the given valuations:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 52, and Agent 0 at 43. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 60, and Agent 1 at 48. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 66, and Agent 1 at 26. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 56, and Agent 1 at 23. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 36, and Agent 1 at 5. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 93, and Agent 1 at 91. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 71, and Agent 1 at 33. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it at 79, and Agent 0 at 30. Assign to Agent 1.

After the initial allocation, Agent 0 has 6 items and Agent 1 has 2 items. To balance the allocation, we can reassign items:

- Reassign Item 5 (valued at 93 by Agent 0 and 91 by Agent 1) from Agent 0 to Agent 1, as this has the least value difference.

Now, Agent 0 has 5 items, and Agent 1 has 3 items. The allocation is more balanced:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures a more balanced distribution of items based on their valuations while keeping each agent's number of items as close as possible.
