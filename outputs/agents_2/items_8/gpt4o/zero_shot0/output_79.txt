Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  74  35   4  61  31  28  73
1  94  94   7  82  47  11  92  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use a method such as the "round-robin" or "greedy" allocation where we iteratively allocate items to the agent who values them most until all items are distributed. Here's one way to do it:

1. List all the items and their valuations for both agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. If there is a tie in value, allocate to the agent with fewer items so far, or choose arbitrarily if both have the same number of items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values 94, Agent 0 values 34; allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Both agents value 94; allocate to Agent 0 (arbitrarily or based on fewer items).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values 35, Agent 1 values 7; allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values 4, Agent 1 values 82; allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values 61, Agent 1 values 47; allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values 31, Agent 1 values 11; allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values 28, Agent 1 values 92; allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values 73, Agent 1 values 40; allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and each item is allocated to the agent who values it most.
