Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  48  66  36  80  38  24  73
1  69  98  65  60  95  14  29   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [69 98 65 60 95 14 29  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent. We will use the following approach:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most.
3. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 values it at 69. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 48, Agent 1 values it at 98. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 values it at 65. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 values it at 60. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 values it at 95. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 38, Agent 1 values it at 14. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 values it at 29. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 values it at 9. Assign to Agent 0.

Now let's ensure a fair allocation:

Agent 0 gets items: 0, 2, 5, 7  
Agent 1 gets items: 1, 3, 4, 6

Both agents receive 4 items each.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
