Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  58  55  84  56  51  80  38
1  10  95  69  95  85  76  92  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to ensure that the total value of items each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here's a way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item by both agents:  
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 values it at 10.  
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 95.  
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 values it at 69.  
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 values it at 95.  
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 values it at 85.  
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 values it at 76.  
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 values it at 92.  
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 38, Agent 1 values it at 94.  

2. Assign items to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring a fair division of items:

- Agent 0:
  - Items: 0, 2, 3, 5
  - Total valuation: 25 + 55 + 84 + 51 = 215

- Agent 1:
  - Items: 1, 4, 6, 7
  - Total valuation: 95 + 85 + 92 + 94 = 366

The allocation allows each agent to receive four items, and the total valuation each agent receives is as balanced as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
