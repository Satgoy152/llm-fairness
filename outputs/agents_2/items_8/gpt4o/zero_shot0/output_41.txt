Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  72  11  59  82  37  59  16
1  29  31  78  33   4  72  93  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29 31 78 33  4 72 93 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the method of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's evaluate the total valuations for each possible allocation:

- Agent 0 valuations: [16, 72, 11, 59, 82, 37, 59, 16]
- Agent 1 valuations: [29, 31, 78, 33, 4, 72, 93, 72]

Let's begin by allocating items with the highest individual valuations to the respective agents:

1. Item 6 has the highest valuation for Agent 1 at 93.
2. Item 4 has the highest valuation for Agent 0 at 82.
3. Item 2 has a high valuation for Agent 1 at 78.
4. Item 1 has a high valuation for Agent 0 at 72.
5. Item 5 has a high valuation for Agent 1 at 72.
6. Item 3 has a high valuation for Agent 0 at 59.
7. Item 7 has the same valuation for both agents, but we can give it to Agent 1 as they have a higher remaining total.
8. Item 0 has a higher valuation for Agent 1 than Agent 0, so we allocate it to Agent 1.

Let's calculate the allocations based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 5, 6, 7

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
