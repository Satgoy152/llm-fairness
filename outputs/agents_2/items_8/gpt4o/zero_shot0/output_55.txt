Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  14  17  88  71  26  63  12
1  79  78  73  45  82  41  72  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [79 78 73 45 82 41 72 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives. We will consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [75, 14, 17, 88, 71, 26, 63, 12]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [79, 78, 73, 45, 82, 41, 72, 35]

One possible approach is to use a greedy method, where we assign items based on the highest remaining value for each agent, while ensuring that both agents receive four items each (since there are 8 items in total).

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Item 3 (Value 88 for Agent 0 and 45 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 0.
2. Item 4 (Value 71 for Agent 0 and 82 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 1.
3. Item 0 (Value 75 for Agent 0 and 79 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 1.
4. Item 1 (Value 14 for Agent 0 and 78 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 1.
5. Item 2 (Value 17 for Agent 0 and 73 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 1.
6. Item 6 (Value 63 for Agent 0 and 72 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 0.
7. Item 5 (Value 26 for Agent 0 and 41 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 0.
8. Item 7 (Value 12 for Agent 0 and 35 for Agent 1) goes to Agent 0.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items [3, 6, 5, 7]
- Agent 1 receives items [4, 0, 1, 2]

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 5, 7],
    "1": [4, 0, 1, 2]
}
```

This distribution attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an equal number of items.
