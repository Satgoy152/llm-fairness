Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  14  52  22  43  12  28   2
1   5  66   6  74  21  53   5  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. We can do this by comparing the valuations and assigning the items based on who values them more.

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 38, and Agent 1 values it at 5. Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 14, and Agent 1 values it at 66. Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 52, and Agent 1 values it at 6. Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 22, and Agent 1 values it at 74. Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 43, and Agent 1 values it at 21. Assign to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 12, and Agent 1 values it at 53. Assign to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 28, and Agent 1 values it at 5. Assign to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 2, and Agent 1 values it at 42. Assign to Agent 1.

The allocations based on the above analysis are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
