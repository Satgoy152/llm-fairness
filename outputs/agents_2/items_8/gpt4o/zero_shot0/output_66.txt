Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5   2  85  50  30  14  13  67
1  71  50  22  84  49  49   7  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method like the "Envy-Free" allocation, which strives to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent according to their preferences.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**
   - Highest to Lowest: Item 2 (85), Item 7 (67), Item 3 (50), Item 4 (30), Item 5 (14), Item 6 (13), Item 0 (5), Item 1 (2).

2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**
   - Highest to Lowest: Item 3 (84), Item 0 (71), Item 1 (50), Item 7 (57), Item 4 (49), Item 5 (49), Item 2 (22), Item 6 (7).

3. **Allocate the highest valued items:**
   - Item 2 goes to Agent 0 (since it's their highest value item and Agent 1 values it relatively low).
   - Item 3 goes to Agent 1 (since it's their highest value item).

4. **Continue Allocation:**
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it second highest (67), Agent 1 also values it highly (57). Allocate to Agent 0 for balance.
   - Item 0: Allocate to Agent 1 (they value it second highest at 71, while Agent 0 values it lowest).
   - Item 4: Both agents have a moderate valuation, allocate to Agent 1 to balance the number of items.
   - Item 5: Allocate to Agent 1 (they value it higher than Agent 0).
   - Item 6: Allocate to Agent 0 (to balance item count).
   - Item 1: Allocate to Agent 0 (they value it lowest, but it balances the number of items).

5. **Final Allocation Balancing:**
   - Ensure both agents have 4 items each.

Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 6, 1],
    "1": [3, 0, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 4 items, and attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on their stated preferences.
