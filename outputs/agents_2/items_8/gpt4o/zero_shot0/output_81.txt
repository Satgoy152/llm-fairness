Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  57  82  69  47  26  48  46
1  22  20   6  52  11  38  35  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring equity. We can do this by comparing the valuations and distributing items accordingly.

Let's examine the valuations provided:

- Agent 0: [15, 57, 82, 69, 47, 26, 48, 46]
- Agent 1: [22, 20, 6, 52, 11, 38, 35, 49]

The total number of items is 8, and there are 2 agents, so each agent should receive 4 items.

The allocation strategy will involve comparing the valuations for each item and distributing the items to the agent with the higher valuation for that item, while maintaining an equal number of items per agent.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (22 > 15), so allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (57 > 20), so allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (82 > 6), so allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (69 > 52), so allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (47 > 11), but Agent 0 already has 3 items, so allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (38 > 26), so allocate to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (48 > 35), but Agent 0 already has enough items, so allocate to Agent 1.
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (49 > 46), so allocate to Agent 1.

Now, checking the allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: [0, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Adjusting to ensure each agent receives 4 items, we'll adjust the allocations:

- Agent 0: [1, 2, 3, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 4, 5, 7]

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
