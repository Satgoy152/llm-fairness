Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  33  89   0  11  21  24  67
1  42   7  81  54  79  48  39  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a balanced share of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Sort Items by Value for Each Agent**: First, sort the items based on the value each agent assigns to them. This helps in identifying which items are more valuable to each agent.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Allocate the items to agents one by one, starting from the most valued item for each agent, while keeping track of the total number of items each agent receives.

3. **Balancing Items**: Ensure each agent receives an equal number of items or as evenly distributed as possible.

4. **Final Allocation**: Present the allocation in the specified JSON format.

Following these steps, below is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 5, 7, which have the values 26, 89, 21, and 67 respectively.
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 4, 6, which have the values 7, 54, 79, and 39 respectively.

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives, while also ensuring each agent gets four items.
