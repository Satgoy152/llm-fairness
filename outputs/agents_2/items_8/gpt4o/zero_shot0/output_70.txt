Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  68  16  22  11  78  24  91
1  28  39  72  32  23  98  38   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's evaluate the best possible allocation given the valuations:

Agent 0 Valuations:
- 0: 1
- 1: 68
- 2: 16
- 3: 22
- 4: 11
- 5: 78
- 6: 24
- 7: 91

Agent 1 Valuations:
- 0: 28
- 1: 39
- 2: 72
- 3: 32
- 4: 23
- 5: 98
- 6: 38
- 7: 0

To achieve a fair allocation, we will attempt to balance the total value each agent receives by assigning the items in a way that maximizes the sum of the values each agent gets from their allocated items.

1. Assign item 7 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it highly (91) and Agent 1 values it very low (0).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the highest (98) and Agent 0 values it relatively high but less (78).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it highly (68) and it's the second-highest value for them.
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it highly (72) and Agent 0 values it much less (16).
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it higher (32) than Agent 0 (22).
6. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it higher (28) than Agent 0 (1).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it higher (24) than Agent 1 (38), but it balances the allocation better.
8. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it higher (11) than Agent 1 (23), but it balances the allocation better.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 2, 3, 5

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
