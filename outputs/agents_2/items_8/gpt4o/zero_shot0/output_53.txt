Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  96  51  82  54  50  58  15
1  42  68  63   9  47  62  41  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on maximum value for each agent while maintaining a balance in the number of items each agent gets.

Let's determine the allocations:

1. We start by considering the highest value for each agent and allocate that item to the respective agent if it's not already allocated.

2. Continue this process while ensuring each agent gets an equal number of items, or as close to equal as possible.

Here's an approach to solve the allocation:

- Sort the items by value from highest to lowest for each agent.
- Assign items to agents alternately, starting with the highest value item available for each agent.

Let's allocate:

1. Agent 0's values: [96, 82, 58, 54, 51, 50, 32, 15]
2. Agent 1's values: [91, 68, 63, 62, 47, 42, 41, 9]

Start with the highest values and distribute the items:

- Agent 0 receives item 1 (96) and item 3 (82).
- Agent 1 receives item 7 (91) and item 5 (62).
- Agent 0 receives item 6 (58) and item 4 (54).
- Agent 1 receives item 2 (63) and item 0 (42).

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6, 4],
    "1": [7, 5, 2, 0]
}
```

This allocation is fair as both agents receive 4 items each and the distribution attempts to maximize the value for each agent.
