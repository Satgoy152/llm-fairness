Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  43  84  68  87  59  10  85
1  92  85  11  73  76  19  62  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: \(50 + 43 + 84 + 68 + 87 + 59 + 10 + 85 = 486\)
   - Agent 1: \(92 + 85 + 11 + 73 + 76 + 19 + 62 + 25 = 443\)

2. **Iteratively Assign Items**:
   - Start by allocating the item that has the highest valuation difference between the two agents to the agent that values it more. This helps in balancing the overall valuation.

3. **Allocation Steps**:
   - Compare each item and allocate them based on the highest differential benefit.
   
4. **Fair Allocation**:
   - Allocate items in a manner that tries to get the total valuations as equal as possible, while ensuring each agent gets 4 items because there are 8 items in total.

Here's the allocation based on the process above:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations of items between the two agents, ensuring a fair distribution based on their preferences.
