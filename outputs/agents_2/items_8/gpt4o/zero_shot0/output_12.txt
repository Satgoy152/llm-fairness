Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  47  78  60  51  81  15  65
1  39  60  48  29  54  59  58  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. We'll try to assign the items such that the sum of the valuations for each agent is as close as possible, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's one way to do it:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they received all items:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 66 + 47 + 78 + 60 + 51 + 81 + 15 + 65 = 463
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 39 + 60 + 48 + 29 + 54 + 59 + 58 + 59 = 406

2. Since Agent 0 values the items more overall, we'll try to allocate items such that the overall valuation for each agent is balanced.

3. Assign items based on ensuring each agent gets a similar total valuation:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 3, 5, 6]
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 4, 7]

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 7]
}
```

With these allocations:
- Agent 0's total valuation: 66 + 78 + 60 + 81 + 15 = 300
- Agent 1's total valuation: 47 + 54 + 65 = 166

This allocation provides a more balanced distribution of total valuations between the two agents, considering the constraints provided.
