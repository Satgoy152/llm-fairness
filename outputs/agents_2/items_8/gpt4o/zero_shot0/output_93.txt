Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  85  46  99  97  28  56  83
1  43  11   2  13  89   4  58  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll compare the sum of valuations for different allocations and choose the one that is most equitable.

Here are the valuations for the agents:

- Agent 0: [11, 85, 46, 99, 97, 28, 56, 83]
- Agent 1: [43, 11, 2, 13, 89, 4, 58, 29]

Let's evaluate the items and allocate them such that the total value is maximized for each agent:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (43 vs. 11)
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (85 vs. 11)
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (46 vs. 2)
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (99 vs. 13)
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (97 vs. 89)
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (28 vs. 4)
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (58 vs. 56)
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (83 vs. 29)

Based on the valuation comparison, we can allocate the items as follows to balance the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 6]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items.
