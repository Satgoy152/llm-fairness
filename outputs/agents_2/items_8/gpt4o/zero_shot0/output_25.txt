Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  83  80   2  57  29  94  73
1  11  33  88  66  70  48  41  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets four items since there are eight items in total. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to each item.
2. Try to allocate items such that the sum of values for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the total values for each potential allocation:

- Agent 0's total valuation for items: 17, 83, 80, 2, 57, 29, 94, 73
- Agent 1's total valuation for items: 11, 33, 88, 66, 70, 48, 41, 75

Now, let's try to achieve a balanced allocation:

Allocate items to Agent 0:
- Items: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Total value: 17 + 83 + 29 + 94 = 223

Allocate items to Agent 1:
- Items: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Total value: 88 + 66 + 70 + 75 = 299

This allocation gives a balanced distribution in terms of both the number of items and the total value each agent receives. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
