Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  86   8  41  62  53  25   0
1  32  19  67  46   4  28  90  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [32 19 67 46  4 28 90 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple method like the "greedy" allocation approach. This method involves each agent picking their most valued item, and then proceeding to the next highest valued item among the remaining ones until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the process for the given table:

Agent 0's valuations: [93, 86, 8, 41, 62, 53, 25, 0]  
Agent 1's valuations: [32, 19, 67, 46, 4, 28, 90, 97]

1. Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 93)
2. Agent 1 picks item 7 (value 97)
3. Agent 1 picks item 6 (value 90)
4. Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 86)
5. Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 67)
6. Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 62)
7. Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 53)
8. Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 41)

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5, 3],
    "1": [7, 6, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives an integer number of items and no item is left unallocated.
