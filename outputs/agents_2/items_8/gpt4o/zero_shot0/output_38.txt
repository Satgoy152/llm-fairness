Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  16  52  83  54  22  58  13
1  52  76  27  39  64  81  72  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple approach based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets exactly four items, as there are two agents and eight items.

Let's calculate the total value for each possible allocation and choose the one that maximizes the fairness, which could be interpreted as ensuring each agent's total value is as balanced as possible. Here's one such allocation:

1. Agent 0: Allocate items that provide relatively high value to Agent 0 compared to Agent 1.
2. Agent 1: Allocate items that provide relatively high value to Agent 1 compared to Agent 0.

After analyzing, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 4, 5, 6

This allocation ensures a balanced distribution based on the given valuations. The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers the valuations and attempts to balance the total value each agent receives.
