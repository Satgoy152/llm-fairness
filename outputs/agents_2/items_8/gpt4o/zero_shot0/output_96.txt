Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  26  38  13  63  20  78  21
1  44  44  87  12  57  31  84  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [44 44 87 12 57 31 84 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. We will aim to ensure that both agents receive a nearly equal total value, if possible.

Let's calculate the total value for each agent if we allocate items one by one based on maximizing their individual valuations:

Agent 0's valuations: [83, 26, 38, 13, 63, 20, 78, 21]
Agent 1's valuations: [44, 44, 87, 12, 57, 31, 84, 45]

We'll allocate items as follows, trying to balance the value received by each:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 87, which is high, so allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 84, higher than Agent 0's 78, so allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 83, higher than Agent 1's 44, so allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 63, higher than Agent 1's 57, so allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 1**: Both value it equally (44), but Agent 0 needs more value, so allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 7**: Similar reasoning, allocate to Agent 1 since it balances the total value more.
7. **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 1 as it balances the total value more.
8. **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 0 as it balances the total value more.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 1, 3, 4]
- Agent 1 receives items: [2, 5, 6, 7]

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives as fairly as possible.
