Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  23  26  44  49  83  73  61
1  58  34   3  45  27  52  51  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items such that the distribution of total values is as balanced as possible between the agents.

Let's calculate the total value for each agent:

- Agent 0: 74 + 23 + 26 + 44 + 49 + 83 + 73 + 61 = 433
- Agent 1: 58 + 34 + 3 + 45 + 27 + 52 + 51 + 28 = 298

We will try to allocate the items such that both agents get a fair share of the total value.

After considering the values, a possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 4, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 5]

Here is the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value based on their respective valuations.
