Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  58  43  45  25  61  22  79
1  75  23  87  76  88  29  50  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. A simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation each agent has for unallocated items in a round-robin fashion. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. Start with all items unallocated.
2. Each agent picks the item they value the most from the remaining unallocated items.
3. Repeat until all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 89. Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 88. Allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. Agent 0 next values item 7 the highest at 79. Allocate item 7 to agent 0.
4. Agent 1 then values item 2 the highest at 87. Allocate item 2 to agent 1.
5. Agent 0 next values item 5 the highest at 61. Allocate item 5 to agent 0.
6. Agent 1 next values item 3 the highest at 76. Allocate item 3 to agent 1.
7. Agent 0 next values item 1 the highest at 58. Allocate item 1 to agent 0.
8. Agent 1 next values item 6 the highest at 50. Allocate item 6 to agent 1.

After all items are allocated, we have:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7, 5, 1],
    "1": [4, 2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets four items, and attempts to maximize their total valuation based on the provided table.
