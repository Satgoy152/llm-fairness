Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  41   8  30  84  31  71  28
1   2  73  43  33  11   9  92   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method like the "envy-free" or "maximize total valuation" approach. However, given the simplicity of this table, I'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would receive for different allocations.
2. Ensure each agent gets a fair share or an equal number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

Agent 0 has higher valuations for items: 0, 4, 6
Agent 1 has higher valuations for items: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7

Allocations based on maximizing valuations:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3, 5, 7

Let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while distributing the items.
