Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  21  96  96  14  51  59  85
1  81  69  92  68  36  78   3  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim for a distribution where the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
   - Agent 0: 82 + 21 + 96 + 96 + 14 + 51 + 59 + 85 = 504
   - Agent 1: 81 + 69 + 92 + 68 + 36 + 78 + 3 + 28 = 455

2. Aim to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is as close to their fair share as possible. In this case, each agent should ideally receive around half of the total combined valuation (959/2 â‰ˆ 479.5).

3. Allocate items to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

- Assign item 2 and 3 to agent 0 (since those have high values for agent 0).
- Assign item 5 and 1 to agent 1 (since those have high values for agent 1).
- Continue assigning items to balance the remaining values.

After this process, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 3, 6, 7]
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 82 + 96 + 96 + 59 + 85 = 418

- Agent 1: [1, 4, 5]
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 69 + 36 + 78 = 183

In summary, the allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

Note: The total values for each agent might not perfectly match their ideal fair share due to the integer nature of item allocations, but this allocation aims to balance the values as best as possible given the constraints.
