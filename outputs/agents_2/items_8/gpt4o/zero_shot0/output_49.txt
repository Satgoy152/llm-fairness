Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  90   7  84  16  31  30  98
1  83   3  33  22  18  17  76  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their valuations for the items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0's total value: \(92 + 90 + 7 + 84 + 16 + 31 + 30 + 98 = 448\)
   - Agent 1's total value: \(83 + 3 + 33 + 22 + 18 + 17 + 76 + 71 = 323\)

2. Aim for a fair distribution by maximizing the satisfaction (value) for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 4, 6, 7

Let's confirm the total values for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0's total value: \(92 + 90 + 84 + 31 = 297\)
- Agent 1's total value: \(33 + 18 + 76 + 71 = 198\)

This allocation doesn't perfectly balance the total values, but it offers a reasonable distribution based on the given values.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
