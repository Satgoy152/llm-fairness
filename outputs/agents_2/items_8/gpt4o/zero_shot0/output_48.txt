Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  76  69  42  84  16  58  35
1  11  85  19  84  98  83  52  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we will aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. We'll consider the valuations provided and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 Total Value: 58 + 76 + 69 + 42 + 84 + 16 + 58 + 35 = 438
- Agent 1 Total Value: 11 + 85 + 19 + 84 + 98 + 83 + 52 + 75 = 507

Now let's try to allocate the items as fairly as possible:

1. Start by giving each agent the item they value the most:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most (84).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (98), but since Agent 0 values it highly too, let's consider the second highest for agent 1: item 1 (85).

2. Continue allocating by comparing the remaining highest values:
   - Agent 0 gets item 0 (58), and item 2 (69).
   - Agent 1 gets item 3 (84).
   
3. Allocate remaining items by balancing the sum of values:
   - Agent 0 gets item 6 (58).
   - Agent 1 gets item 5 (83).

4. Distribute the remaining items such that the total valuation is close:
   - Agent 0 gets item 7 (35).
   - Agent 1 gets item 2 (19).

5. Final allocation:
   - Agent 0: Items [4, 0, 2, 6, 7]
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 5]

This allocation attempts to balance the total values as closely as possible. Now, let's put this into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 2, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
