Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  14  45  78  30  11  51  76
1  91  92  55  49  50  49  42  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to use a method like the "envy-free" allocation, where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value as highly as possible given the constraints.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 90 + 14 + 45 + 78 + 30 + 11 + 51 + 76 = 395
   - Agent 1: 91 + 92 + 55 + 49 + 50 + 49 + 42 + 40 = 468

2. Sort the items for each agent based on their valuations from highest to lowest:
   - Agent 0: [0 (90), 3 (78), 7 (76), 6 (51), 2 (45), 4 (30), 1 (14), 5 (11)]
   - Agent 1: [1 (92), 0 (91), 2 (55), 4 (50), 3 (49), 5 (49), 6 (42), 7 (40)]

3. Allocate items to maximize the valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness.

After careful analysis, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 3, 6, 7]
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 2, 4, 5]

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives based on their preferences.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
