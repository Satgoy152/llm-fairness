Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  50   2  82  28  29   1  66
1  35  28  32  53  36  80  57  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [35 28 32 53 36 80 57 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to ensure that both agents receive approximately equal total value. Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent
- **Agent 0's Valuations:** 33, 50, 2, 82, 28, 29, 1, 66
  - Total = 33 + 50 + 2 + 82 + 28 + 29 + 1 + 66 = 291

- **Agent 1's Valuations:** 35, 28, 32, 53, 36, 80, 57, 62
  - Total = 35 + 28 + 32 + 53 + 36 + 80 + 57 + 62 = 383

### Step 2: Allocate Items
We aim to allocate items such that both agents get approximately half of the total value.

**Initial Allocation:**
- Assign items based on the highest value preference of each agent.

1. **Item 3**: Highest for Agent 0 (82 vs. 53)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. **Item 5**: Highest for Agent 1 (80 vs. 29)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

3. **Item 7**: Highest for Agent 0 (66 vs. 62)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. **Item 0**: Highest for Agent 0 (33 vs. 35)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. **Item 6**: Highest for Agent 1 (57 vs. 1)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

6. **Item 1**: Highest for Agent 0 (50 vs. 28)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

7. **Item 4**: Highest for Agent 1 (36 vs. 28)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

8. **Item 2**: Highest for Agent 1 (32 vs. 2)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

**Resulting Allocation:**

- **Agent 0**: Items [3, 0, 7, 1]
  - Total Valuation = 82 + 33 + 66 + 50 = 231

- **Agent 1**: Items [5, 6, 4, 2]
  - Total Valuation = 80 + 57 + 36 + 32 = 205

### Step 3: Adjust Allocations (if necessary)
The allocations seem fairly balanced in terms of the total valuation each agent receives, with Agent 0 receiving slightly more. If needed, minor adjustments can be made, but given the constraints, this allocation fairly represents the preference and overall value distribution.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 7, 1],
    "1": [5, 6, 4, 2]
}
