Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  97   0  92  21  30  44  61
1  15  81  36  72  62  51  98  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. This approach aims to maximize the total valuation for all agents. Let's evaluate the table and allocate accordingly:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 62, Item 1: 97, Item 2: 0, Item 3: 92, Item 4: 21, Item 5: 30, Item 6: 44, Item 7: 61

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 15, Item 1: 81, Item 2: 36, Item 3: 72, Item 4: 62, Item 5: 51, Item 6: 98, Item 7: 83

Based on this data, we can prioritize the allocation of each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 (62) vs. Agent 1 (15) -> Allocate to Agent 0
2. Item 1: Agent 0 (97) vs. Agent 1 (81) -> Allocate to Agent 0
3. Item 2: Agent 0 (0) vs. Agent 1 (36) -> Allocate to Agent 1
4. Item 3: Agent 0 (92) vs. Agent 1 (72) -> Allocate to Agent 0
5. Item 4: Agent 0 (21) vs. Agent 1 (62) -> Allocate to Agent 1
6. Item 5: Agent 0 (30) vs. Agent 1 (51) -> Allocate to Agent 1
7. Item 6: Agent 0 (44) vs. Agent 1 (98) -> Allocate to Agent 1
8. Item 7: Agent 0 (61) vs. Agent 1 (83) -> Allocate to Agent 1

The total allocation becomes:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4, 5, 6, 7]

The final allocations in the specified JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
