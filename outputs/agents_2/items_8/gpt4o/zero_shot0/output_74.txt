Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  28  90  68  84  11  52  68
1  55  61   7  90  55  87  28   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[19 28 90 68 84 11 52 68]
 [55 61  7 90 55 87 28  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to equalize the total valuation each agent receives. Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 19 + 28 + 90 + 68 + 84 + 11 + 52 + 68 = 420
- Agent 1's total valuation: 55 + 61 + 7 + 90 + 55 + 87 + 28 + 0 = 383

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign high-value items to the agent who values them more, while keeping the overall balance in mind.
2. Check the remaining items and adjust as necessary.

### Allocation Attempt:

1. **Items highly valued by Agent 0:** 
   - Item 2 (90), Item 4 (84), Item 7 (68)

2. **Items highly valued by Agent 1:**
   - Item 3 (90), Item 5 (87), Item 1 (61)

3. **Remaining items:**
   - Item 0 (19 for Agent 0, 55 for Agent 1)
   - Item 6 (52 for Agent 0, 28 for Agent 1)

### Balancing the allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (higher valuation for Agent 1)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (higher valuation for Agent 0)

Now, let's check the total allocations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 2, 4, 6, 7
  - Total valuation: 90 + 84 + 52 + 68 = 294

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 0, 1, 3, 5
  - Total valuation: 55 + 61 + 90 + 87 = 293

### Final Allocation:
The allocations are balanced as closely as possible given the constraints:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 5]
}
```
