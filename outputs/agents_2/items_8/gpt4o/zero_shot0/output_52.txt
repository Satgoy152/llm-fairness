Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  81  44  18  15  97  10  64
1  18  53  89  95   1  42  44  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [18 53 89 95  1 42 44 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple greedy algorithm. We'll assign each item to the agent who values it more, ensuring each agent ends up with 4 items, as there are 8 items in total.

Hereâ€™s how the allocation can be done:

1. Evaluate the difference in valuation between the two agents for each item.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the higher valuation, keeping track of how many items each agent has.
3. Adjust if necessary to ensure each agent gets exactly 4 items.

Let's do the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 67, Agent 1 values at 18. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 81, Agent 1 values at 53. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 44, Agent 1 values at 89. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 18, Agent 1 values at 95. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 15, Agent 1 values at 1. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values at 97, Agent 1 values at 42. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values at 10, Agent 1 values at 44. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values at 64, Agent 1 values at 92. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocation:
- Agent 0 has items: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Agent 1 has items: 2, 3, 6, 7

Both agents have 4 items each, ensuring a fair distribution. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
