Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  73  76  72  13   9  16  53
1  97  34  65  71   5  78  32  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives. A common approach is to use the "envy-free" or "maximal matching" method, but given the small number of agents and items, a simpler heuristic can work well.

Here's one way to allocate items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with exactly 4 items (since there are 8 items and 2 agents).

Let's perform the allocation:

### Step 1: Calculate total valuations for each agent
- Agent 0: 5 + 73 + 76 + 72 + 13 + 9 + 16 + 53 = 317
- Agent 1: 97 + 34 + 65 + 71 + 5 + 78 + 32 + 92 = 474

### Step 2: Allocate items based on highest individual valuations
- Item 0: Agent 1 (97) > Agent 0 (5)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (73) > Agent 1 (34)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (76) > Agent 1 (65)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (72) > Agent 1 (71)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (13) > Agent 1 (5)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (78) > Agent 0 (9)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (16) > Agent 1 (32)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (92) > Agent 0 (53)

### Step 3: Adjust to ensure each agent gets 4 items
Based on the initial allocation above, Agent 0 has 5 items and Agent 1 has 3. We need to adjust:

- Reassign item 6 from Agent 0 to Agent 1, who loses less value compared to other possible swaps.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 2, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: [0, 5, 6, 7]

### JSON Output
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
