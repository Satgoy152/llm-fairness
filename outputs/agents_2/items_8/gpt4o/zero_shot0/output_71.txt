Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64   0  82  67  91  33  83  46
1  28  24  84  53  51  77  35  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [28 24 84 53 51 77 35 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maximizing their total valuations, we can use a simple algorithm that considers the differences in valuations for each item by both agents. The goal is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's compare the valuations for each item and assign accordingly:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 64, and Agent 1 values it at 28. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 0, and Agent 1 values it at 24. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 82, and Agent 1 values it at 84. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 67, and Agent 1 values it at 53. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 91, and Agent 1 values it at 51. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 33, and Agent 1 values it at 77. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 83, and Agent 1 values it at 35. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 46, and Agent 1 values it at 55. Assign to Agent 1.

Based on the above decisions, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations.
