Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  69  45  30  76  49  96  92
1  58  91  48  23  22  68  15  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize their total valuations while ensuring each agent receives an equal or nearly equal number of items. There are 8 items and 2 agents, so ideally, each agent should receive 4 items.

Let's evaluate the total valuations for different allocations:

1. **Agent 0** receives items with higher valuations to maximize the total value for each agent. 
2. **Agent 1** receives the remaining items.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 4, 6, 7
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 2, 3, 5

Calculating the total valuation for each agent:
- **Agent 0**: 76 (Item 0) + 76 (Item 4) + 96 (Item 6) + 92 (Item 7) = 340
- **Agent 1**: 91 (Item 1) + 48 (Item 2) + 23 (Item 3) + 68 (Item 5) = 230

This allocation gives each agent 4 items, and the total valuation is fairly distributed based on the agents' preferences.

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
