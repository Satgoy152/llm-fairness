Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  73  53  61  78  31  92  50
1  98  39  96  31  64  95   4   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. In this case, we can use a simple greedy algorithm to allocate items based on the highest value for each agent.

Let's evaluate each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 98, and Agent 0 values it at 81. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 73, and Agent 1 values it at 39. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 96, and Agent 0 values it at 53. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 61, and Agent 1 values it at 31. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 78, and Agent 1 values it at 64. Allocate to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 95, and Agent 0 values it at 31. Allocate to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 92, and Agent 1 values it at 4. Allocate to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 50, and Agent 1 values it at 0. Allocate to Agent 0.

After allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 2, 5

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
