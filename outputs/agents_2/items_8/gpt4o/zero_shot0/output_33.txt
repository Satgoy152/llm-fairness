Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  44   3  50  47  35   0  34
1  84  42  30  44  38  61  31  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 42 30 44 38 61 31 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple algorithm to maximize the total valuations for each agent. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. Compare the valuations of both agents for each item.
2. Assign each item to the agent who has the higher valuation for that item.

After comparing the valuations, we get the following allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (98 vs 84)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (44 vs 42)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (3 vs 30)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (50 vs 44)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (47 vs 38)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (35 vs 61)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (0 vs 31)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (34 vs 61)

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
