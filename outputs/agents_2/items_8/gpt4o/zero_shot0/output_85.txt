Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  29  10  70  25  26  49  37
1  48  12  94  85   4  79   5  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items such that the total value they perceive is as equal as possible. Here's one way to achieve this:

First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 69 + 29 + 10 + 70 + 25 + 26 + 49 + 37 = 315
- Agent 1: 48 + 12 + 94 + 85 + 4 + 79 + 5 + 78 = 405

Next, attempt to allocate items so that the total perceived value for each agent is roughly equal.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign items 3, 5, 6, and 7 to Agent 0. Total value for Agent 0 is 70 + 26 + 49 + 37 = 182
- Assign items 0, 1, 2, and 4 to Agent 1. Total value for Agent 1 is 48 + 12 + 94 + 4 = 158

Now, present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the perceived values between the two agents as evenly as possible given the constraints.
