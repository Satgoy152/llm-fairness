Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  78  41  69  21  23  38  58
1  29  79  53  41   3  21  35  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [29 79 53 41  3 21 35 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an equal or nearly equal number of items. Here's one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Items: 0 (85), 1 (78), 3 (69), 7 (58)

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Items: 2 (53), 4 (3), 5 (21), 6 (35)

This allocation gives each agent four items, and it attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
