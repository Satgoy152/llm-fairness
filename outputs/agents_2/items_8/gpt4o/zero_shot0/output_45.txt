Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  36  94  81  96  84   6  49
1  51  31  15  25  14  59  89  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an equal number of items, since there are 8 items in total and 2 agents, each agent should receive 4 items. Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocation:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 74
- Item 1: 36
- Item 2: 94
- Item 3: 81
- Item 4: 96
- Item 5: 84
- Item 6: 6
- Item 7: 49

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 51
- Item 1: 31
- Item 2: 15
- Item 3: 25
- Item 4: 14
- Item 5: 59
- Item 6: 89
- Item 7: 28

To maximize the total valuation for each agent, we will allocate items based on the highest difference in valuations between the agents, giving preference to the agent with the higher valuation.

1. Item 4: Agent 0 has a much higher valuation (96 vs 14), allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 6: Agent 1 has a much higher valuation (89 vs 6), allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 has a much higher valuation (94 vs 15), allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 5: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (84 vs 59), allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 3: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (81 vs 25), allocate to Agent 0, but Agent 0 already has 4 items, so allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 0: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (74 vs 51), allocate to Agent 0.
7. Item 7: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (49 vs 28), allocate to Agent 0, but Agent 0 already has 4 items, so allocate to Agent 1.
8. Item 1: The remaining unallocated item, allocate to Agent 1.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
