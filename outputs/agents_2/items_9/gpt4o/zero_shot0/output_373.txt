Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  89  26  25  96  66  69  43  91
1  91  19  48  98   4  22  98  49  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll use a simple heuristic approach where we allocate items based on the highest value difference between the agents for each item.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute value of these differences, giving priority to items where agents differ more in their valuations.
3. Allocate items to the agent who values them more until all items are allocated, ensuring a fair distribution in terms of the number of items if possible.

Let's calculate the differences and proceed with the allocation:

| Item | Agent 0 Valuation | Agent 1 Valuation | Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| 0    | 73                | 91                | -18                            |
| 1    | 89                | 19                | 70                             |
| 2    | 26                | 48                | -22                            |
| 3    | 25                | 98                | -73                            |
| 4    | 96                | 4                 | 92                             |
| 5    | 66                | 22                | 44                             |
| 6    | 69                | 98                | -29                            |
| 7    | 43                | 49                | -6                             |
| 8    | 91                | 77                | 14                             |

Sorted by absolute difference:

| Item | Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) |
|------|--------------------------------|
| 3    | -73                            |
| 4    | 92                             |
| 1    | 70                             |
| 6    | -29                            |
| 2    | -22                            |
| 5    | 44                             |
| 0    | -18                            |
| 8    | 14                             |
| 7    | -6                             |

Now, allocate items:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7

Finally, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
