Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3   4  49  45  92  25   7  48  58
1  56  29  14  29  96  35  81  18  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, the goal is to achieve a balance that is as fair as possible.

Let's summarize the valuations for each item by both agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 3, Agent 1 values at 56
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 4, Agent 1 values at 29
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 49, Agent 1 values at 14
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 45, Agent 1 values at 29
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 92, Agent 1 values at 96
- Item 5: Agent 0 values at 25, Agent 1 values at 35
- Item 6: Agent 0 values at 7, Agent 1 values at 81
- Item 7: Agent 0 values at 48, Agent 1 values at 18
- Item 8: Agent 0 values at 58, Agent 1 values at 64

To allocate items fairly, we can use a strategy that assigns items based on higher relative valuation differences:

1. Start by identifying items that have a significantly higher value for one agent compared to the other.
2. Allocate items to the agent who values them more, while ensuring a balanced distribution overall.

By analyzing the value differences and aiming for a fair distribution, we can propose the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8

This allocation seeks to maximize the total value each agent receives based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 total value: 49 (item 2) + 45 (item 3) + 92 (item 4) + 48 (item 7) = 234
- Agent 1 total value: 56 (item 0) + 29 (item 1) + 35 (item 5) + 81 (item 6) + 64 (item 8) = 265

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
