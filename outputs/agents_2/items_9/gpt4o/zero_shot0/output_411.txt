Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  99  45  15  38  75  31  67  87
1  48  93  96  93  95  24  23  16  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value received by each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally receive about half of the items, so one agent will receive 5 items and the other 4.

Let's evaluate the situation and allocate based on the highest values each agent has for the items:

1. Evaluate the highest valuations for each agent:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuations for items: 0 (98), 1 (99), 8 (87), 5 (75), 7 (67)
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuations for items: 2 (96), 3 (93), 4 (95), 6 (23)

2. Allocate items based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0 (value 98)
  - Item 1 (value 99)
  - Item 5 (value 75)
  - Item 7 (value 67)
  - Item 8 (value 87)

- Agent 1:
  - Item 2 (value 96)
  - Item 3 (value 93)
  - Item 4 (value 95)
  - Item 6 (value 23)

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of items, ensuring that each agent's total valuation is maximized based on their preferences.
