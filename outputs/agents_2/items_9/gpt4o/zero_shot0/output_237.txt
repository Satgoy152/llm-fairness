Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  67  48  53  95   4  51  56  73
1  21  54  59  71  53  34  23  66  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. This can be approached with a simple heuristic or a more complex optimization strategy. Here, we'll use a heuristic approach to balance the allocations based on the given values.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 18 + 67 + 48 + 53 + 95 + 4 + 51 + 56 + 73 = 465
- Agent 1: 21 + 54 + 59 + 71 + 53 + 34 + 23 + 66 + 21 = 402

We want to distribute the items such that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations. A simple way to do this is to allocate each item to the agent who values it more, but to ensure fairness, we might need to adjust some allocations to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the highest value preference with adjustments for fairness when there's a tie in preferences:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 21 more than Agent 0's 18, so allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 67, higher than Agent 1's 54, so allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 59 more than Agent 0's 48, so allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 71 more than Agent 0's 53, so allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 95 more than Agent 1's 53, so allocate to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 34 more than Agent 0's 4, so allocate to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 51 more than Agent 1's 23, so allocate to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 66 more than Agent 0's 56, so allocate to Agent 1.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 73 more than Agent 1's 21, so allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's see the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4, 6, 8
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 3, 5, 7

Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Adjustments might be necessary if there's a need for a more balanced total value, but this simple method provides a good starting point.
