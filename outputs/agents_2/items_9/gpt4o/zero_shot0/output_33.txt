Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35   8  23  65  22   1  69  51  76
1  43  33  47  89  34  92  91  26  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction of both agents, considering their valuations. One common approach is to use an envy-free allocation or maximize the sum of utilities while ensuring a balanced distribution of items.

Here's a potential allocation that balances the total valuations for each agent:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0: 35 + 8 + 23 + 65 + 22 + 1 + 69 + 51 + 76 = 350
   - Agent 1: 43 + 33 + 47 + 89 + 34 + 92 + 91 + 26 + 13 = 468

2. Allocate items to balance the total values each agent receives:
   - Give items 0, 4, 5, 6, 7 to Agent 0
   - Give items 1, 2, 3, 8 to Agent 1

Now, let's see the total valuation each agent gets with this distribution:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 4, 5, 6, 7: 35 + 22 + 1 + 69 + 51 = 178
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 3, 8: 33 + 47 + 89 + 13 = 182

This distribution aims to fairly allocate the items while balancing the total valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 8]
}
```
