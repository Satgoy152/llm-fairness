Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  41  89  52  66  58   1  43  58
1  46  39  88  18   5  52  97  10  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46 39 88 18  5 52 97 10 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an equal number of items (or as close as possible). Given there are 9 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally receive 4 or 5 items.

Let's consider the valuations and allocate accordingly:

### Valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Values for items: [54, 41, 89, 52, 66, 58, 1, 43, 58]
- **Agent 1**: Values for items: [46, 39, 88, 18, 5, 52, 97, 10, 91]

### Allocation Strategy:

1. Allocate high-value items to each agent based on their individual preferences.
2. Ensure both agents receive 4 or 5 items each.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 2 (value 89)
  - Item 4 (value 66)
  - Item 0 (value 54)
  - Item 5 (value 58)
  - Item 3 (value 52)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 6 (value 97)
  - Item 8 (value 91)
  - Item 2 (value 88)
  - Item 5 (value 52)
  - Item 7 (value 10)

### Fair Allocation:

Given the above allocations, we need to balance and verify the distribution of items so that each agent receives a fair share based on the total valuation:

#### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Items: [0, 1, 3, 4, 7]

- **Agent 1**:
  - Items: [2, 5, 6, 8]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an equitable distribution of items considering their preferences.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
