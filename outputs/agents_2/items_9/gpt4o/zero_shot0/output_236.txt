Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  36  46  68  83  97  41  80  59
1  88  18  17  54  54  53  93  77  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple approach where we try to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation for all items: 573
- Agent 1's total valuation for all items: 509

Let's start by initially allocating items based on their highest valuation by an agent. We will switch items between agents if it increases the total valuation for both agents.

Initially, let's allocate each item to the agent who values it more:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (88 vs 43)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (36 vs 18)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (46 vs 17)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (68 vs 54)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (83 vs 54)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (97 vs 53)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (93 vs 41)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (80 vs 77)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (59 vs 55)

Initial allocation based on highest valuations:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 6]

Now, let's ensure both agents have a fair allocation by adjusting and redistributing items if possible to equalize the number of items:

Redistribute items to balance the allocation:
- Move Item 8 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 0: loses 59, Agent 1: gains 55)

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 6, 8]

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each receives an integer number of items.
