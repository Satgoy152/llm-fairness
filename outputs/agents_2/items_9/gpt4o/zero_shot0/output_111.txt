Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  58  79  61  50   5  84  61  39
1  23  99   2  31  66  81  25  98  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as equitable as possible based on the valuations provided. One approach is to use a fair division method, such as the "maximum total valuation" method, where we aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while keeping the distribution as fair as possible.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each potential allocation and aim for a balanced distribution:

1. Calculate the total valuations for each item for both agents:
   - Agent 0: 58, 58, 79, 61, 50, 5, 84, 61, 39
   - Agent 1: 23, 99, 2, 31, 66, 81, 25, 98, 33

2. Allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while keeping the total value balanced:

   - Agent 0 should get items that have higher value for them compared to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 should get items that have higher value for them compared to Agent 0.

3. Allocate items:
   
   - Agent 0: Prefer items with higher values for Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Prefer items with higher values for Agent 1.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8

This allocation can be represented in the JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the values each agent receives based on their preferences while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
