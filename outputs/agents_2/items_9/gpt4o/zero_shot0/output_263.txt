Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  76  42  19   5  27  19  84  34
1  54  53  30  68  54  50  69  45  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54 53 30 68 54 50 69 45 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each receives a roughly equal number of items. 

First, let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 82 + 76 + 42 + 19 + 5 + 27 + 19 + 84 + 34 = 388
- Agent 1's total value: 54 + 53 + 30 + 68 + 54 + 50 + 69 + 45 + 95 = 528

Next, let's allocate the items by considering the valuations. We want to allocate items so that both agents feel they are getting fair value.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **High-Value Items**: Assign high-value items based on the agent's preference, ensuring each agent gets a fair share.
2. **Balance**: Try to balance the total value received by each agent as closely as possible while maintaining an equal number of items.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

#### Step-by-step Allocation:

- Consider each item's value for both agents and prioritize assignments based on higher value differences.
  
1. **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it at 95, which is much higher than Agent 0's 34. Assign to Agent 1.
2. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 84, higher than Agent 1's 45. Assign to Agent 0.
3. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 82, which is higher than Agent 1's 54. Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 69, higher than Agent 0's 19. Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 68, higher than Agent 0's 19. Assign to Agent 1.
6. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 76, higher than Agent 1's 53. Assign to Agent 0.
7. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 50, higher than Agent 0's 27. Assign to Agent 1.
8. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 54, higher than Agent 0's 5. Assign to Agent 1.
9. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 42, higher than Agent 1's 30. Assign to Agent 0.

This results in each agent receiving 4 or 5 items, and the allocation attempts to respect the valuation preferences as best as possible given the constraints.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items [0, 1, 2, 7] and Agent 1 the items [3, 4, 5, 6, 8], aiming to fairly distribute the perceived value among the agents based on their valuations.
