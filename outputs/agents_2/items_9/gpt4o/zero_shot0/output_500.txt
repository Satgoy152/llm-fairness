Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  76  60   7  81  82  21  11  78
1  49  58  50  65  33  26  45  64  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values the item more, ensuring that the total number of items each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's compute this step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations

- **Agent 0 Total Valuation** = 28 + 76 + 60 + 7 + 81 + 82 + 21 + 11 + 78 = 444
- **Agent 1 Total Valuation** = 49 + 58 + 50 + 65 + 33 + 26 + 45 + 64 + 59 = 449

### Step 2: Allocate Items

Let's allocate items by comparing the values each agent assigns to an item and try to ensure each agent receives an approximately equal number of items.

#### Item-wise Allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it more (49 vs 28), allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it more (76 vs 58), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it more (60 vs 50), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it more (65 vs 7), allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it more (81 vs 33), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it more (82 vs 26), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it more (45 vs 21), allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it more (64 vs 11), allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it more (78 vs 59), allocate to Agent 0.

Now let's ensure each agent receives approximately the same number of items:

- Agent 0 currently has items: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
- Agent 1 currently has items: [0, 3, 6, 7]

### Step 3: Balance the Number of Items

Agent 0 has 5 items, and Agent 1 has 4 items. To balance, we can transfer one item from Agent 0 to Agent 1. Let's transfer the item with the smallest valuation difference:

- Transfer Item 2 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 (valuations: 60 vs 50).

#### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 4, 5, 8]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 3, 6, 7]

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents have an approximately equal number of items, while trying to respect their valuations as much as possible.
