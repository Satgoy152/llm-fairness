Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  14   8  56  19  27  36  96   2
1  54  84  53  29  63  87  75  25  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives a similar total value.

Let's calculate the total value each agent has for all the items and then try to allocate the items to make the total values as balanced as possible.

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 50
- Item 1: 14
- Item 2: 8
- Item 3: 56
- Item 4: 19
- Item 5: 27
- Item 6: 36
- Item 7: 96
- Item 8: 2

Total for Agent 0: 50 + 14 + 8 + 56 + 19 + 27 + 36 + 96 + 2 = 308

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 54
- Item 1: 84
- Item 2: 53
- Item 3: 29
- Item 4: 63
- Item 5: 87
- Item 6: 75
- Item 7: 25
- Item 8: 17

Total for Agent 1: 54 + 84 + 53 + 29 + 63 + 87 + 75 + 25 + 17 = 487

Now, let's allocate the items to balance the overall value for both agents.

One possible allocation could be:
- Assign items to maximize the value for each agent while trying to balance the total values.

After testing different allocations, one fair allocation could be:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8

This allocation gives:
- Total value for Agent 0: 50 (item 0) + 56 (item 3) + 36 (item 6) + 96 (item 7) = 238
- Total value for Agent 1: 84 (item 1) + 53 (item 2) + 63 (item 4) + 87 (item 5) + 17 (item 8) = 249

This is a fairly balanced allocation based on the valuations provided.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
}
```
