Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  75  75  37  17   6  42  19  81
1  46  49  24  46  46  89  77  29   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [46 49 24 46 46 89 77 29  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on these valuations. We will try to allocate items in a manner that balances the total value each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value**: Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Start by assigning items to the agent who values them the most until both agents have a similar total valuation of their assigned items.

3. **Balance the Allocation**: Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent receives a fair share, trying to keep the total valuation as balanced as possible.

Let's see how this works for the given data:

```
Agent 0 valuations: [1, 75, 75, 37, 17, 6, 42, 19, 81]
Agent 1 valuations: [46, 49, 24, 46, 46, 89, 77, 29, 0]
```

### Initial Allocation Based on Maximum Valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (46 > 1)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (75 > 49)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (75 > 24)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (46 > 37)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (46 > 17)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (89 > 6)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (77 > 42)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (29 > 19)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (81 > 0)

### Evaluate Total Valuations:

- Agent 0: \(75 + 75 + 81 = 231\)
- Agent 1: \(46 + 46 + 46 + 89 + 77 + 29 = 333\)

### Adjust Allocation for Fairness:

To balance the allocations more fairly, we need to adjust some items. One way to do this is by swapping items where the difference in valuation is the smallest but results in a fairer total valuation.

Let's swap:
- Item 3 from Agent 1 to Agent 0
- Item 8 from Agent 0 to Agent 1

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

### Recalculate Total Valuations:

- Agent 0: \(75 + 75 + 37 = 187\)
- Agent 1: \(46 + 46 + 89 + 77 + 29 + 81 = 368\)

While not perfectly equal, this allocation aims to balance the values more fairly based on the initial constraints.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent receives a fair share based on the valuations provided.
