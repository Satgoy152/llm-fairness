Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  83  30  72  34  60  41  69  46
1  56  11   5  90  12  27  44  58  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives an equal or balanced share of the items. We'll use a simple greedy approach to achieve this.

First, let's calculate the total valuation of each item for both agents and then allocate items one by one to the agent who values it the most while keeping an eye on the balance of the number of items each agent receives.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the value difference for each item between the two agents.
2. Allocate items to the agent with the higher valuation, ensuring both agents get a balanced number of items.

Let's proceed with this method:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (59 vs. 56), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (83 vs. 11), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (30 vs. 5), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (90 vs. 72), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (34 vs. 12), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (60 vs. 27), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (44 vs. 41), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (69 vs. 58), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it more (87 vs. 46), allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's ensure both agents receive a balanced number of items. We need to adjust since Agent 0 has 6 items and Agent 1 has 3 items:

- Move Item 2 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 (as its value is lowest for Agent 0 among their items and doesn't heavily affect Agent 1's valuation).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures both agents receive four items each, balancing the distribution while keeping the valuations as high as possible for each agent.
