Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7  8
0   5  53  46  63  64  73   2  84  8
1  33  87  27  61  13  98  90  77  8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that both agents receive a similar total value of items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
- Try to distribute the items so that the total value of the items allocated to each agent is approximately equal.

Let's calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: 5, 53, 46, 63, 64, 73, 2, 84, 8
  - Total value for Agent 0: 5 + 53 + 46 + 63 + 64 + 73 + 2 + 84 + 8 = 398

- Agent 1's valuations: 33, 87, 27, 61, 13, 98, 90, 77, 8
  - Total value for Agent 1: 33 + 87 + 27 + 61 + 13 + 98 + 90 + 77 + 8 = 494

Now, let's aim for a fair distribution based on these valuations:

Agent 0 values:
- High-value items for Agent 0: 7 (84), 5 (73), 4 (64), 3 (63)
- Allocate these items to Agent 0.

Agent 1 values:
- High-value items for Agent 1: 5 (98), 1 (87), 6 (90), 7 (77)
- Allocate these items to Agent 1.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to balance the total value:

Remaining items: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8

Allocate based on remaining values:

- Agent 0: (0, 2, 8) - 5, 46, 8 = Total 59
- Agent 1: (1, 6) - 87, 90 = Total 177

Final allocation based on fair value:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.
