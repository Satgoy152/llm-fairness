Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  1  73   8  72  79  98  43   7  32
1  8  73  98  54  24  74  39  69  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. Since each agent has different valuations for the items, we'll aim to allocate the items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is as fair as possible.

Let's consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent by considering each item one by one:

1. Compare the value each agent has for each item.
2. Assign the item to the agent who values it more.

Here's the allocation process:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 8, Agent 0 values it at 1. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Both agents value it at 73. Assign to Agent 0 (arbitrary choice, since both values are equal).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 98, Agent 0 values it at 8. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 values it at 54. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 values it at 24. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 values it at 74. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 values it at 39. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 69, Agent 0 values it at 7. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it at 62, Agent 0 values it at 32. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, thus making the distribution fair based on their valuations.
