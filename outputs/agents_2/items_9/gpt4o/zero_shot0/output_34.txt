Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  40  22  88  49  47  95  56   9
1  61  55  85  71   9  60  13   4  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to balance the total valuation between the agents.

Let's calculate and balance the valuations:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 49 + 40 + 22 + 88 + 49 + 47 + 95 + 56 + 9 = 455
- Agent 1 total valuation: 61 + 55 + 85 + 71 + 9 + 60 + 13 + 4 + 73 = 431

Now let's allocate items to equalize the total valuation as much as possible:

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 6] with valuations 49, 88, 95 (total = 232)
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8] with valuations 55, 85, 9, 60, 4, 73 (total = 223)

This gives an approximately balanced allocation of total valuations.

Here's the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
