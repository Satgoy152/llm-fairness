Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  21  33  69  15  83  64  33  39
1  65  39  87  70  74  46  97  56  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for both agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that iteratively assigns items to the agent who values them the most.

Here's how the allocation could be done step by step:

1. List all items with their valuations for each agent.
2. Sort the list of items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents.
3. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's implement this:

1. Items with valuations:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values at 90, Agent 1 values at 65.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values at 21, Agent 1 values at 39.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values at 33, Agent 1 values at 87.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values at 69, Agent 1 values at 70.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values at 15, Agent 1 values at 74.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values at 83, Agent 1 values at 46.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values at 64, Agent 1 values at 97.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values at 33, Agent 1 values at 56.
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values at 39, Agent 1 values at 15.

2. Sort by the difference in valuations:
   - Item 2: Difference = 54 (Agent 1 prefers)
   - Item 4: Difference = 59 (Agent 1 prefers)
   - Item 6: Difference = 33 (Agent 1 prefers)
   - Item 1: Difference = 18 (Agent 1 prefers)
   - Item 7: Difference = 23 (Agent 1 prefers)
   - Item 3: Difference = 1 (Agent 1 prefers)
   - Item 5: Difference = 37 (Agent 0 prefers)
   - Item 0: Difference = 25 (Agent 0 prefers)
   - Item 8: Difference = 24 (Agent 0 prefers)

3. Allocate:
   - Agent 1 gets items 2, 4, 6, 1, 7, 3.
   - Agent 0 gets items 5, 0, 8.

Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 0, 8],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 1, 7, 3]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items based on the highest valuation priorities and ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items.
