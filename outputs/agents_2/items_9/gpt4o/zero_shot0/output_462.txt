Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17   9  41  97  84  92  61  44  54
1  30  87  24  87  85  71  81   0  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use an approach where we try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

One possible way to achieve this is to use a method called "envy-free allocation," where each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their own valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is as equal as possible.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:**

   - Agent 0's total valuation: 17 + 9 + 41 + 97 + 84 + 92 + 61 + 44 + 54 = 499
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 30 + 87 + 24 + 87 + 85 + 71 + 81 + 0 + 35 = 500

2. **Allocate Items:**

   - Start by assigning items to the agent who values them the most.
   - Ensure each agent gets an equal number of items (4 for one, 5 for the other, since there are 9 items in total).

Here's a possible allocation based on maximizing each agent's perceived value:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 2: Value = 41
  - Item 3: Value = 97
  - Item 4: Value = 84
  - Item 5: Value = 92

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: Value = 30
  - Item 1: Value = 87
  - Item 6: Value = 81
  - Item 7: Value = 0
  - Item 8: Value = 35

This allocation gives each agent items that maximize their total perceived value.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures both agents receive a fair distribution of items based on their valuations.
