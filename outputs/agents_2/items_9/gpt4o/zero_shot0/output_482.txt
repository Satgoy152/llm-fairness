Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  61  18  64  89  24  69  85  49
1  77  19  21   8  43  79  11  76  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim for an allocation that considers the agents' valuations and attempts to balance the overall value each agent receives. We'll use a simple heuristic approach to make an equitable division of items based on the given valuations.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent.
2. Iteratively allocate items to the agent who values them more, ensuring that the total number of items allocated to each agent is balanced.

Hereâ€™s how we can allocate the items:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign the item to the agent who values it more, while trying to maintain a balanced distribution.

Following this approach, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 4, 7, 8

This allocation attempts to balance both the number of items and the total valuation each agent receives.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of items based on their individual valuations, while keeping the total number of items allocated to each agent close to equal.
