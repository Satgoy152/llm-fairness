Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  78  94  25  67  18  28  64  67
1  48  78  59  98  98  25  43  46  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. Given the valuations from both agents, we can approach this by calculating the total valuation each agent would get for different allocations and aim to minimize the difference in their total valuations.

Let's break down the allocation:

- Agent 0's valuations: [83, 78, 94, 25, 67, 18, 28, 64, 67]
- Agent 1's valuations: [48, 78, 59, 98, 98, 25, 43, 46, 53]

One approach is to allocate items by comparing which agent values each item more, but also ensuring a balanced overall distribution. 

Let's proceed with one possible allocation:

- Items 0, 1, 2, 5, 7 to Agent 0
- Items 3, 4, 6, 8 to Agent 1

Calculating the total valuation for this allocation:
- Agent 0: 83 (item 0) + 78 (item 1) + 94 (item 2) + 18 (item 5) + 64 (item 7) = 337
- Agent 1: 98 (item 3) + 98 (item 4) + 43 (item 6) + 53 (item 8) = 292

Another possible allocation could be:

- Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 to Agent 0
- Items 4, 6, 7, 8 to Agent 1

Let's calculate the total valuation for this allocation:

- Agent 0: 83 (item 0) + 78 (item 1) + 94 (item 2) + 25 (item 3) + 18 (item 5) = 298
- Agent 1: 98 (item 4) + 43 (item 6) + 64 (item 7) + 53 (item 8) = 258

This allocation seems more balanced, but let's try to improve it further:

Final allocation:

- Items 0, 1, 2, 5, 8 to Agent 0
- Items 3, 4, 6, 7 to Agent 1

Calculating the total valuation for this allocation:

- Agent 0: 83 (item 0) + 78 (item 1) + 94 (item 2) + 18 (item 5) + 67 (item 8) = 340
- Agent 1: 98 (item 3) + 98 (item 4) + 43 (item 6) + 64 (item 7) = 303

This allocation offers a more balanced valuation between the agents, considering their preferences.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
