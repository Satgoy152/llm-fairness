Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  28   4  46  97  12  47  93  14
1   8  73  90  85  93  49  52  57  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One common approach to achieve this is by using an algorithm that considers each agent's valuation for the items, such as the "Envy-Free" or "Max-Min Fairness" approach. However, given the simplicity of this situation, we can manually allocate the items by comparing valuations.

Let's start by examining the valuations for each item and allocate accordingly to maximize fairness:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 72 and Agent 1 at 8. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 28 and Agent 1 at 73. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 4 and Agent 1 at 90. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 46 and Agent 1 at 85. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 97 and Agent 1 at 93. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 12 and Agent 1 at 49. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 47 and Agent 1 at 52. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 93 and Agent 1 at 57. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 14 and Agent 1 at 46. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it more, maximizing the total valuation each agent receives.
