Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  95  18  85  45  41  95  45  61
1  32  31  79  10   1  67  34  41  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, one common approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total valuation.

First, let's sum up the valuations for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0: 86 + 95 + 18 + 85 + 45 + 41 + 95 + 45 + 61 = 571
- Agent 1: 32 + 31 + 79 + 10 + 1 + 67 + 34 + 41 + 90 = 385

Now, let's distribute the items in such a way that we aim to balance the total valuations for each agent. We'll start by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, and then we'll check for balance and make necessary adjustments.

### Initial Allocation:
1. Item 0: Agent 0 (86 > 32)
2. Item 1: Agent 0 (95 > 31)
3. Item 2: Agent 1 (79 > 18)
4. Item 3: Agent 0 (85 > 10)
5. Item 4: Agent 0 (45 > 1)
6. Item 5: Agent 1 (67 > 41)
7. Item 6: Agent 0 (95 > 34)
8. Item 7: Agent 1 (41 > 45)
9. Item 8: Agent 1 (90 > 61)

### Valuations after Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: 86 + 95 + 85 + 45 + 95 = 406
- Agent 1: 79 + 67 + 41 + 90 = 277

### Adjustments for Fairness:
To create a more balanced allocation, we need to redistribute some items.

- Swap item 7 from Agent 1 to Agent 0. This increases Agent 0's total value by 45 and decreases Agent 1's total value by 41.
- Swap item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 1. This decreases Agent 0's total value by 45 and increases Agent 1's total value by 1.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 1, 3, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: [2, 4, 5, 8]

### Valuations after Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: 86 + 95 + 85 + 95 + 45 = 406
- Agent 1: 79 + 1 + 67 + 90 = 237

Despite the adjustments, Agent 0 still has a higher total valuation, but the allocation is integer and balanced to a reasonable extent given the constraints. This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items.
