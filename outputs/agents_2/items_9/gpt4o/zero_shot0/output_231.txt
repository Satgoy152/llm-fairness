Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  80  50  78   8  47  78  53  72
1  92  26  10  55  41  65   8  67  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [92 26 10 55 41 65  8 67 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring an approximately equal number of items for each agent. We'll use a simple heuristic approach to achieve this.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 1: 80
   - Item 3: 78
   - Item 0: 29
   - Item 5: 47
   - Total value: 234

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 2: 10
   - Item 4: 41
   - Item 6: 8
   - Item 7: 67
   - Item 8: 78
   - Total value: 204

This allocation gives each agent 4 and 5 items, respectively, and attempts to balance the total valuation as much as possible.

Final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
