Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  50   6  58  18  73  79  54   6
1  71   6  37  43  59  25  58  47  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. This is often referred to as maximizing the "social welfare" or finding an "efficient" allocation. 

Here's a step-by-step plan to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Start allocating items one by one to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

Agent 0's valuations for items:  
0: 95, 1: 50, 2: 6, 3: 58, 4: 18, 5: 73, 6: 79, 7: 54, 8: 6

Agent 1's valuations for items:  
0: 71, 1: 6, 2: 37, 3: 43, 4: 59, 5: 25, 6: 58, 7: 47, 8: 95

We can assign each item based on which agent values it more. In case of a tie, we can assign the item to either agent as it doesn't affect the fair allocation. Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values 95, Agent 1 values 71. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values 50, Agent 1 values 6. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values 6, Agent 1 values 37. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values 58, Agent 1 values 43. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values 18, Agent 1 values 59. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values 73, Agent 1 values 25. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values 79, Agent 1 values 58. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values 54, Agent 1 values 47. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values 6, Agent 1 values 95. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value relatively more, thus achieving a fair distribution according to their valuations.
