Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  49  56  71  96  44  91  77  84
1  91  85   1  89  16  66  47  85  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall satisfaction of both agents based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that allocates items one by one to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that the number of items each agent receives is balanced.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Calculate each agent's total valuation for all items.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 78 + 49 + 56 + 71 + 96 + 44 + 91 + 77 + 84 = 646
- Agent 1's total valuation: 91 + 85 + 1 + 89 + 16 + 66 + 47 + 85 + 11 = 511

Since there are 9 items, we'll aim to allocate 4 or 5 items to each agent to keep the distribution as balanced as possible.

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (91 vs 78).
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (85 vs 49).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (56 vs 1).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (89 vs 71).
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (96 vs 16).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (66 vs 44).
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (91 vs 47).
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (77 vs 85). (Allocate to Agent 1 to balance distribution)
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (84 vs 11).

Agent 0 receives items [2, 4, 6, 8].
Agent 1 receives items [0, 1, 3, 5, 7].

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items while also considering their valuations.
