Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  30  31  56  34  73  52  62  42
1  16  45  79  13  37  53  86  20  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One potential solution is to use a greedy method, distributing items based on the highest valuation differences for each agent. Here's a step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items based on these differences, assigning each item to the agent who values it more.
3. Ensure both agents have nearly equal numbers of items.

Let's calculate the differences and allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values more by (87 - 16) = 71
- Item 1: Agent 1 values more by (45 - 30) = 15
- Item 2: Agent 1 values more by (79 - 31) = 48
- Item 3: Agent 0 values more by (56 - 13) = 43
- Item 4: Agent 1 values more by (37 - 34) = 3
- Item 5: Agent 0 values more by (73 - 53) = 20
- Item 6: Agent 1 values more by (86 - 52) = 34
- Item 7: Agent 0 values more by (62 - 20) = 42
- Item 8: Agent 1 values more by (92 - 42) = 50

Let's allocate the items based on these valuations:

- Agent 0: Items {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Agent 1: Items {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and the distribution is based on maximizing their respective valuations.
