Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  66  88   5  36   8  49  96  96
1  26  47  31  57  32  67  29  64  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy method while considering the relative valuations of the agents.

Let's analyze the items and their valuations:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 26
   - Agent 1 values it at 26
   - Equal valuation, can go to either agent.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 66
   - Agent 1 values it at 47
   - Agent 0 values it higher.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 88
   - Agent 1 values it at 31
   - Agent 0 values it significantly higher.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 5
   - Agent 1 values it at 57
   - Agent 1 values it significantly higher.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 36
   - Agent 1 values it at 32
   - Agent 0 values it slightly higher.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 8
   - Agent 1 values it at 67
   - Agent 1 values it significantly higher.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 29
   - Agent 0 values it higher.

8. **Item 7**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 96
   - Agent 1 values it at 64
   - Agent 0 values it significantly higher.

9. **Item 8**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 96
   - Agent 1 values it at 10
   - Agent 0 values it significantly higher.

Based on these valuations, a fair allocation might involve giving each agent the items where their valuation advantage is highest. This way, each agent can maximize their perceived value of the items they receive.

Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 5

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items that they value highly, and all items are allocated.
