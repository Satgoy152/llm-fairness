Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  70  59  96  14  19  95  42  62
1  32   4  10  97  74  20  32  78  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total value each agent gets, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we assign items based on the highest difference in valuations between the two agents, thereby maximizing the total perceived value.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort items by the absolute value of the difference in descending order.
3. Allocate items to the agent who values them more, ensuring each agent receives a total of 4 or 5 items, as we have 9 items in total.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Differences in valuations:
  - Item 0: 99 - 32 = 67
  - Item 1: 70 - 4 = 66
  - Item 2: 59 - 10 = 49
  - Item 3: 97 - 96 = 1
  - Item 4: 74 - 14 = 60
  - Item 5: 20 - 19 = 1
  - Item 6: 95 - 32 = 63
  - Item 7: 78 - 42 = 36
  - Item 8: 62 - 44 = 18

- Sorted items by absolute difference:
  - Item 0: Difference = 67
  - Item 1: Difference = 66
  - Item 4: Difference = 60
  - Item 6: Difference = 63
  - Item 2: Difference = 49
  - Item 7: Difference = 36
  - Item 8: Difference = 18
  - Item 3: Difference = 1
  - Item 5: Difference = 1

- Allocation:
  - Agent 0 gets items: 0, 1, 6, 2, 5
  - Agent 1 gets items: 3, 4, 7, 8

So the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
