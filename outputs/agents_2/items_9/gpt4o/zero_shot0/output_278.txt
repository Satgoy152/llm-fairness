Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  71   8   3  84  50  59  58  26
1  90  76  79  55  64  56  13  80  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each gets an integer number of items. One common approach is to use the "envy-free" allocation method, where neither agent should prefer the otherâ€™s allocation over their own. However, given the fixed number of items and the fact that each agent must get an integer number of items, we can adopt a heuristic approach to maximize fairness.

Let's proceed with the allocation by alternating giving the item to the agent who values it the most until each has received approximately half of the items.

1. **Sort items by the difference in valuations**: Calculate the difference in value each agent assigns to an item and sort the items by this difference. This helps in determining which agent values an item more relative to the other agent.

2. **Allocate items**: Assign each item to the agent who values it more, ensuring each agent ends up with a similar number of items.

Here's how we can do it:

### Allocation Process

1. Calculate the difference in valuations:
    - Item 0: |90 - 54| = 36
    - Item 1: |76 - 71| = 5
    - Item 2: |79 - 8| = 71
    - Item 3: |55 - 3| = 52
    - Item 4: |84 - 64| = 20
    - Item 5: |56 - 50| = 6
    - Item 6: |59 - 13| = 46
    - Item 7: |80 - 58| = 22
    - Item 8: |79 - 26| = 53

2. Sort items by the absolute difference:
    - Item 2: 71
    - Item 8: 53
    - Item 3: 52
    - Item 6: 46
    - Item 0: 36
    - Item 7: 22
    - Item 4: 20
    - Item 5: 6
    - Item 1: 5

3. Allocate items to the agent who values it more:
    - Agent 1 gets Item 2 (79 vs 8)
    - Agent 1 gets Item 8 (79 vs 26)
    - Agent 1 gets Item 3 (55 vs 3)
    - Agent 0 gets Item 6 (59 vs 13)
    - Agent 1 gets Item 0 (90 vs 54)
    - Agent 1 gets Item 7 (80 vs 58)
    - Agent 0 gets Item 4 (84 vs 64)
    - Agent 0 gets Item 5 (50 vs 56)
    - Agent 0 gets Item 1 (71 vs 76)

4. Ensure each agent has a fair share. If there's imbalance, adjust by swapping items to balance the number of items.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4, 5, 1],
    "1": [2, 8, 3, 0, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, with Agent 0 receiving four items and Agent 1 receiving five items. Both agents receive a fair value based on their preferences.
