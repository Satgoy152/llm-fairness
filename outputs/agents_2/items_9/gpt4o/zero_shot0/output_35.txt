Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  33  57  47  66  77  26  40  63
1   6  22  52  22  18  15  43  82  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's examine the valuations and try to balance the distribution.

Given the valuations:
- Agent 0: [98, 33, 57, 47, 66, 77, 26, 40, 63]
- Agent 1: [6, 22, 52, 22, 18, 15, 43, 82, 11]

To achieve a fair allocation, we should consider distributing the items to balance the total value each agent receives. A simple strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it more.

Here's a breakdown of which agent values each item more:
- Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (98 vs. 6).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (33 vs. 22).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (52 vs. 57).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (47 vs. 22).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (66 vs. 18).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (77 vs. 15).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (43 vs. 26).
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (82 vs. 40).
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (63 vs. 11).

Let's allocate the items based on the above analysis:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 6, 7]

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 384 from items [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8] and Agent 1 a total value of 177 from items [2, 6, 7]. This distribution seems fair given the agents' valuations. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [2, 6, 7]
}
```
