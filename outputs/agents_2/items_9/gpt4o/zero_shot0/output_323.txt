Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78   0  95  49  43   7  93  13  95
1  66  78  73  52  21  11   5  35  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the perceived value each agent receives from their allocated items. This can be achieved by assigning items such that the total value of items for each agent is as balanced as possible, considering their individual valuations.

Let's break down the process:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item by each agent.
2. Use a simple greedy approach to allocate items by alternating the assignment based on who values the item more until each agent has roughly the same total valuation.

Here's how the allocation might look:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 values it at 66. Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 values it at 78. Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 values it at 73. Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 values it at 52. Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 values it at 21. Assign to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 7, Agent 1 values it at 11. Assign to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 values it at 5. Assign to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 values it at 35. Assign to Agent 1.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 values it at 43. Assign to Agent 0.

The allocations can be presented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the total perceived valuation for each agent given the constraints of integer item allocation.
