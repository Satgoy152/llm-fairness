Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  85  29  54  46  50  11  88  85
1  74  32  24  82  89  11  99  19  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [74 32 24 82 89 11 99 19 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to balance the total value of items each agent receives. Let's calculate the allocations:

**Agent 0 Values:**
- Total Value: 91 + 85 + 29 + 54 + 46 + 50 + 11 + 88 + 85 = 539

**Agent 1 Values:**
- Total Value: 74 + 32 + 24 + 82 + 89 + 11 + 99 + 19 + 56 = 486

We will try to distribute the items so that the total value each agent receives is as close as possible. Here is one possible allocation:

- Assign items with higher valuations to Agent 1 where possible to balance the total values.
- Adjust based on the highest priority value differences.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- **Agent 1**: 2, 4, 7, 8

Let's calculate the total values for each agent:

**Agent 0** will receive items: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- Total Value: 91 + 85 + 54 + 50 + 11 = 291

**Agent 1** will receive items: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Total Value: 24 + 89 + 19 + 56 = 188

This allocation is not perfectly balanced, but it fairly distributes the items based on the value each agent places on them.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items while attempting to balance the overall value received by each agent.
