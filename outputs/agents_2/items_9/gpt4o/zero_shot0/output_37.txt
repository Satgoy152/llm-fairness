Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  28  93  60  89  38  19  77  13
1  79  70  85  75  93   2  34  25   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim for a distribution that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. A common approach is to use a method like the "envy-free" allocation or simply try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to the items and attempt to balance the allocation:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 18  
- Item 1: 28  
- Item 2: 93  
- Item 3: 60  
- Item 4: 89  
- Item 5: 38  
- Item 6: 19  
- Item 7: 77  
- Item 8: 13  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 79  
- Item 1: 70  
- Item 2: 85  
- Item 3: 75  
- Item 4: 93  
- Item 5: 2  
- Item 6: 34  
- Item 7: 25  
- Item 8: 4  

By examining these valuations, we can attempt to make a fair allocation. A simple approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, but we must also ensure each agent gets an integer number of items. Given there are 9 items, a balanced allocation would normally give each agent 4 or 5 items.

After analyzing the values, we can make the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 items [0, 2, 4, 7, 8] and Agent 1 items [1, 3, 5, 6]. This setup attempts to balance the valuations as evenly as possible, given the constraints.
