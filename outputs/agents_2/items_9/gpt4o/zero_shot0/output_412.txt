Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4  5   6   7   8
0  19  45  21  21  80  8  39  64  53
1  99  43  57  73  29  9  90  23  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One common approach is to try to balance the total value of items each agent receives.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: \(19 + 45 + 21 + 21 + 80 + 8 + 39 + 64 + 53 = 350\)
   - Agent 1: \(99 + 43 + 57 + 73 + 29 + 9 + 90 + 23 + 51 = 474\)

2. Allocate items to balance the total value as closely as possible:

   - Assign the item with the highest value difference to the agent who values it more until all items are allocated.
   - Prioritize items where the value difference between agents is largest, meaning one agent values it significantly more than the other.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 99, Agent 0 values it at 19 (assign to Agent 1).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 values it at 29 (assign to Agent 0).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 90, Agent 0 values it at 39 (assign to Agent 1).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 values it at 23 (assign to Agent 0).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 73, Agent 0 values it at 21 (assign to Agent 1).
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 values it at 51 (assign to Agent 0).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 57, Agent 0 values it at 21 (assign to Agent 1).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 values it at 43 (assign to Agent 0).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 values it at 9 (assign to Agent 1).

Final allocations:

Agent 0: [1, 4, 7, 8]  
Agent 1: [0, 2, 3, 5, 6]

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
