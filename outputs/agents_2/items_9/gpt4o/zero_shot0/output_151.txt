Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87   8  88  72  97  46  72  51  53
1  55  71  10  98  80  28  76  77  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[87  8 88 72 97 46 72 51 53]
 [55 71 10 98 80 28 76 77 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to balance the total valuation for each agent. 

Here's a step-by-step solution to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate total valuations for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 87 + 8 + 88 + 72 + 97 + 46 + 72 + 51 + 53 = 574
   - Agent 1: 55 + 71 + 10 + 98 + 80 + 28 + 76 + 77 + 66 = 561

2. **Allocate items to balance the valuations**: We want to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. 

3. **Initial allocation strategy**: 
   - Assign items to agents based on higher individual valuations, but ensure the total value is balanced.

4. **Allocation**:
   - Start by sorting items by the difference in valuation between the agents and allocate items to the agent with the higher valuation.

   Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

   - Agent 0 gets items: [0, 2, 4, 5]
     - Total Valuation = 87 + 88 + 97 + 46 = 318
   - Agent 1 gets items: [1, 3, 6, 7, 8]
     - Total Valuation = 71 + 98 + 76 + 77 + 66 = 358

5. **Final Check**: Ensure all items are allocated and both agents have a relatively balanced total valuation.

Now, presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
