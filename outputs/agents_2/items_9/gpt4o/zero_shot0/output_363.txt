Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  52  68  76  77  70  14  17  97
1  68  58  10  24  11  93  98  87  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the matrix of valuations, one strategy could involve assigning items to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated. Here is a potential allocation:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.
3. If there are ties (both agents have the same valuation for an item), we can decide arbitrarily or based on balancing the number of items if needed.

Applying this strategy, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 68, and Agent 0 values it at 61. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 58, and Agent 0 values it at 52. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 68, and Agent 1 values it at 10. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 76, and Agent 1 values it at 24. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 77, and Agent 1 values it at 11. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 93, and Agent 0 values it at 70. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 98, and Agent 0 values it at 14. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 87, and Agent 0 values it at 17. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 97, and Agent 1 values it at 12. Assign to Agent 0.

Based on this analysis, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
