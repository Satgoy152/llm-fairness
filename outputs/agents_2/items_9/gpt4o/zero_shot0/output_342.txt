Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  36  84  17  36  12  94  17  95
1   3  54  53  86  67  88  70  15  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. This can be done using methods like the "greedy" algorithm or more sophisticated optimization techniques such as linear programming. However, for simplicity, let's use a straightforward approach:

1. Start by determining which agent values each item the most.
2. Allocate the item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure each agent ends up with an equal or nearly equal number of items.

Let's go through the process:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 46, Agent 1 values at 3. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 36, Agent 1 values at 54. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 84, Agent 1 values at 53. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 17, Agent 1 values at 86. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 36, Agent 1 values at 67. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values at 12, Agent 1 values at 88. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values at 94, Agent 1 values at 70. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values at 17, Agent 1 values at 15. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values at 95, Agent 1 values at 70. Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation gives Agent 0 five items and Agent 1 four items. To adjust for fairness in the number of items, we can transfer one less valued item from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

Reallocating item 7 from Agent 0 to Agent 1:

- Agent 0: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Agent 1: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
