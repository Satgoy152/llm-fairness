Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  28  27  98  47  76  56  78  66
1  96  46  42  43   0  78  50  62  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an equal number of items or as close to equal as possible, given that there are 9 items.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each item by both agents and then try to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is maximized, while keeping the allocations balanced.

### Total Valuations for Each Item
- Item 0: Agent 0 (73), Agent 1 (96)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (28), Agent 1 (46)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (27), Agent 1 (42)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (98), Agent 1 (43)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (47), Agent 1 (0)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (76), Agent 1 (78)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (56), Agent 1 (50)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (78), Agent 1 (62)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (66), Agent 1 (74)

### Allocation Approach
1. **Sort Items by Difference in Valuation**: First, sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuation between the two agents. This helps in identifying which items are more contested and which are clearly preferred by one agent.
2. **Allocate Items**: Assign items to the agent with the higher valuation, ensuring that the number of items remains balanced between the two agents.

### Sorted Items by Valuation Difference
- Item 4: Difference = 47
- Item 3: Difference = 55
- Item 5: Difference = 2
- Item 7: Difference = 16
- Item 1: Difference = 18
- Item 6: Difference = 6
- Item 8: Difference = 8
- Item 2: Difference = 15
- Item 0: Difference = 23

### Allocation Plan
- Agent 0: Prefers items 3, 4, 0, 7
- Agent 1: Prefers items 5, 1, 8, 2, 6

Since there are 9 items, each agent should get around 4 to 5 items. We will balance the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 4, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 5, 6, 8]

### Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair distribution of items based on their valuations while maintaining balance in the number of items each agent receives.
