Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  85  86  21  44  14  72  82  15
1  25  35  29  58  87  32   7  86  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets a near-equal share of the total value of items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while trying to balance the total value received by each agent.

First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 total value: 43 + 85 + 86 + 21 + 44 + 14 + 72 + 82 + 15 = 462
- Agent 1 total value: 25 + 35 + 29 + 58 + 87 + 32 + 7 + 86 + 47 = 406

Next, we allocate the items one by one, starting with the item that has the highest difference in value between the two agents, assigning it to the agent who values it more, while trying to maintain a balanced overall value.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 85, Agent 1 at 35. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 at 29. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 44, Agent 1 at 87. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 82, Agent 1 at 86. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 at 58. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 at 25. Allocate to Agent 0.
7. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 at 47. Allocate to Agent 1.
8. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 at 32. Allocate to Agent 1.
9. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 at 7. Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value received by each agent as much as possible while ensuring each item is allocated to the agent who values it more.
