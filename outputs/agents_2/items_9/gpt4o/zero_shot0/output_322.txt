Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  41  87  75  50  25  51  63  54
1  27  65  87  41  90   9  82  52  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (87), then item 3 (75), item 0 (60), item 7 (63), item 8 (54), item 6 (51), item 4 (50), item 1 (41), and item 5 (25).

2. **Agent 1's Preferences**:
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (90), then item 2 (87), item 6 (82), item 1 (65), item 0 (27), item 3 (41), item 7 (52), item 8 (17), and item 5 (9).

To make the allocation fair, we should try to let each agent get items they value highly and try to balance the total value they each receive.

Here's a reasonable allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [2, 3, 0, 5]
  - Total value for Agent 0 = 87 + 75 + 60 + 25 = 247

- **Agent 1**: Items [4, 6, 1, 7, 8]
  - Total value for Agent 1 = 90 + 82 + 65 + 52 + 17 = 306

This allocation gives more total value to Agent 1, but Agent 0 gets fewer items of higher value, which can be considered fair depending on the context.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 0, 5],
    "1": [4, 6, 1, 7, 8]
}
```
