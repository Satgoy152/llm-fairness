Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  29  72  84  78  15  75  90  33
1  33  70  25   0  36  76  10  14  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We can use a simple greedy approach, considering each agent's valuation for each item.

First, let's sum up the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0 Total Value: 94 + 29 + 72 + 84 + 78 + 15 + 75 + 90 + 33 = 570
- Agent 1 Total Value: 33 + 70 + 25 + 0 + 36 + 76 + 10 + 14 + 13 = 277

Given these totals, Agent 0 seems to value the items more overall. However, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's proceed with a greedy allocation strategy:

1. For each item, allocate it to the agent that values it more if possible.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least a few items.

Following this strategy:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 94, Agent 1 at 33. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 70, Agent 0 at 29. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 at 25. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 at 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 at 36. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 76, Agent 0 at 15. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 at 10. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 at 14. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 33, Agent 1 at 13. Allocate to Agent 0.

Checking the allocations, Agent 0 has been allocated all items except 1 and 5, which went to Agent 1. This allocation favors Agent 0 significantly more, so let's adjust to ensure fairness by reallocating one more item to Agent 1:

Reallocate Item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values it more compared to other items Agent 1 received.

Final allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures both agents receive items, with Agent 0 still getting more total value according to their valuations, but Agent 1 receives a fairer share.
