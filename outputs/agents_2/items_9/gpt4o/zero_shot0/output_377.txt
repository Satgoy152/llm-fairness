Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  8  95  74  54  67  61  21  33  74
1  9  25  66   4   7  48  34  53  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. One way to do this is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent.
2. Allocate items one by one, starting with the item that provides the most value to any agent.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would get if they received all items:

- Agent 0: 8 + 95 + 74 + 54 + 67 + 61 + 21 + 33 + 74 = 487
- Agent 1: 9 + 25 + 66 + 4 + 7 + 48 + 34 + 53 + 91 = 337

Now, allocate items by maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 0 (95 vs. 25).
2. Item 8 has the highest value for Agent 1 (91 vs. 74).
3. Item 2 has the next highest value for Agent 0 (74 vs. 66).
4. Item 0 has a slightly higher value for Agent 1 (9 vs. 8).
5. Item 4 has a higher value for Agent 0 (67 vs. 7).
6. Item 5 has a higher value for Agent 0 (61 vs. 48).
7. Item 3 goes to Agent 0 (54 vs. 4).
8. Item 7 goes to Agent 1 (53 vs. 33).
9. Item 6 goes to Agent 1 (34 vs. 21).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share considering their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 5, 3],
    "1": [8, 0, 7, 6]
}
```

Here, Agent 0 receives items [1, 2, 4, 5, 3], and Agent 1 receives items [8, 0, 7, 6].
