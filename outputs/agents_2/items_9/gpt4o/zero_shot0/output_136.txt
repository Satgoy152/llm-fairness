Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38  40  14  21  62  24  94  84  36
1   8  78  51  86  45   0  36  68  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 38 + 40 + 14 + 21 + 62 + 24 + 94 + 84 + 36 = 413
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 8 + 78 + 51 + 86 + 45 + 0 + 36 + 68 + 13 = 385

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - We will attempt to allocate items so that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

3. **Greedy Allocation:**
   - Start by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, then adjust to balance the overall distribution.

4. **Allocation:**
   - Item 0: Higher value for Agent 0 (38 vs. 8) -> Allocate to Agent 0
   - Item 1: Higher value for Agent 1 (78 vs. 40) -> Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 2: Higher value for Agent 1 (51 vs. 14) -> Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 3: Higher value for Agent 1 (86 vs. 21) -> Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 4: Higher value for Agent 0 (62 vs. 45) -> Allocate to Agent 0
   - Item 5: Higher value for Agent 0 (24 vs. 0) -> Allocate to Agent 0
   - Item 6: Higher value for Agent 0 (94 vs. 36) -> Allocate to Agent 0
   - Item 7: Higher value for Agent 0 (84 vs. 68) -> Allocate to Agent 0
   - Item 8: Higher value for Agent 0 (36 vs. 13) -> Allocate to Agent 0

5. **Final Check:**
   - After initial allocation, check if the distribution is balanced and make necessary adjustments.

6. **Adjusted Allocation:**
   - To balance, switch Item 7 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

Final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' valuations, ensuring both receive a balanced total value.
