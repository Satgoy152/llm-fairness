Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  44  57  19   2  49  50  60  66
1  80  53  44  69  66   8  63  46  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's go through the allocation step-by-step:

1. Identify the total value for each agent if they received all the items:
   - Agent 0: 18 + 44 + 57 + 19 + 2 + 49 + 50 + 60 + 66 = 365
   - Agent 1: 80 + 53 + 44 + 69 + 66 + 8 + 63 + 46 + 61 = 490

2. Compare the values for each item and allocate the item to the agent who values it more. In case of ties, the allocation can be made to balance the total number of items each agent receives.

Allocating items:
- Item 0: Agent 1 (80 > 18)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (44 = 44, balancing allocation)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (57 > 44)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (69 > 19)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (66 > 2)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (49 > 8)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (63 > 50)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (60 > 46)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (66 > 61)

After allocation, we need to ensure each agent receives at least four items:
- Agent 0 has 5 items: [1, 2, 5, 7, 8]
- Agent 1 has 4 items: [0, 3, 4, 6]

Final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
