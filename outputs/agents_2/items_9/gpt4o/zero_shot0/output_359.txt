Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  88   1  25  30  52  63  34  27
1  56  56  77  25  96  32  91   0   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [56 56 77 25 96 32 91  0  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maximizing their total valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the total valuations for each item by each agent.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Valuations

For each item, we compare the valuations from the two agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 53, Agent 1 values at 56
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 88, Agent 1 values at 56
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 1, Agent 1 values at 77
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 25, Agent 1 values at 25
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 30, Agent 1 values at 96
- Item 5: Agent 0 values at 52, Agent 1 values at 32
- Item 6: Agent 0 values at 63, Agent 1 values at 91
- Item 7: Agent 0 values at 34, Agent 1 values at 0
- Item 8: Agent 0 values at 27, Agent 1 values at 3

### Step 2: Initial Allocation

Based on who values each item more:
- Item 0: Agent 1
- Item 1: Agent 0
- Item 2: Agent 1
- Item 3: Tie (can be allocated to either)
- Item 4: Agent 1
- Item 5: Agent 0
- Item 6: Agent 1
- Item 7: Agent 0
- Item 8: Agent 0

### Step 3: Ensuring Fair Allocation

We need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items. Initially, we have:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 5, 7, 8] (4 items)
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 4, 6] (4 items)

Since Item 3 is a tie, we can allocate it to any agent to ensure both have 5 items. We can allocate it to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7, 8, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
