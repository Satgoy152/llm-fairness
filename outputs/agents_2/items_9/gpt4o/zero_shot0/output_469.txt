Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  17  79  61  79   3  44  42  90
1  70  35  98  49  10  99  24  36   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations, we can use a method that tries to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's how you can allocate items:

1. **List all items and their values for each agent.**
2. **Find the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.** This helps identify which agent values each item more.
3. **Assign items to the agent that values them more, while trying to balance the total value received by each agent.**

Let's break down the allocation:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value | Difference (Agent 1 - Agent 0) |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| 0    | 31            | 70            | 39                             |
| 1    | 17            | 35            | 18                             |
| 2    | 79            | 98            | 19                             |
| 3    | 61            | 49            | -12                            |
| 4    | 79            | 10            | -69                            |
| 5    | 3             | 99            | 96                             |
| 6    | 44            | 24            | -20                            |
| 7    | 42            | 36            | -6                             |
| 8    | 90            | 4             | -86                            |

**Allocate items:**

- Items with positive differences are allocated to Agent 1, and negative differences to Agent 0.
- Start with items that have the largest differences to maximize fairness.

**Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:** Items 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 1, 2, 5

**Value totals:**

- **Agent 0's Total Value:** 61 + 79 + 44 + 42 + 90 = 316
- **Agent 1's Total Value:** 70 + 35 + 98 + 99 = 302

This allocation provides a fairly balanced distribution of total valuation between the two agents.

The allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5]
}
```
