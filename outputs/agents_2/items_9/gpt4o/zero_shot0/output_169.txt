Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6  7   8
0  54  81  74  13  50  36  60  8  36
1  82  90  95  13  52  85  92  7  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm, which allocates each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it more (82 vs. 54), so allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it more (90 vs. 81), so allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it more (95 vs. 74), so allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Both agents value it equally (13 vs. 13), so we can allocate it to Agent 0 to balance the number of items allocated.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it more (52 vs. 50), so allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it more (85 vs. 36), so allocate to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it more (92 vs. 60), so allocate to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it more (8 vs. 7), so allocate to Agent 0.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it more (36 vs. 15), so allocate to Agent 0.

Given the above allocations, we should also attempt to balance the number of items each agent receives. Initially, Agent 1 has received more items. Let's ensure each agent gets four or five items:

1. Allocate items [0, 1, 2, 4, 5] to Agent 1 (five items).
2. Allocate items [3, 6, 7, 8] to Agent 0 (four items).

This allocation aims to balance both the number of items and the valuations as fairly as possible.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This distribution gives each agent a fair number of items based on their valuations, with slight adjustments for balance.
