Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95   5  94  61  90  59  20  97  34
1  63  44  33  65  64  91  21  61  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use the "maximum sum" or "greedy" method where items are assigned to the agent who values them more, provided it results in a balanced number of items for each agent.

Let's go through the table and allocate each item to the agent who values it more, while also maintaining a balance in the number of items:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the higher valuation unless it creates an imbalance in the number of items distributed between the two agents.
3. If both agents have the same valuation for an item, assign it to the agent who has fewer items at that point.

Let's implement this:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 95, and Agent 1 at 63. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 5, and Agent 1 at 44. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 94, and Agent 1 at 33. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 61, and Agent 1 at 65. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 90, and Agent 1 at 64. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 59, and Agent 1 at 91. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 20, and Agent 1 at 21. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 97, and Agent 1 at 61. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 34, and Agent 1 at 67. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, each agent has received 4 or 5 items. Let's ensure the allocation is balanced:

Agent 0: 4 items (0, 2, 4, 7)
Agent 1: 5 items (1, 3, 5, 6, 8)

This allocation is balanced given the constraints and the valuations. Here's the JSON format for this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
