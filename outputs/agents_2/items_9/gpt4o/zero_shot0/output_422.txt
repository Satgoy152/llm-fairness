Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  66  57  69  43  94  34  95  40
1  18  49  57   9  24  88  67  44   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that both agents receive a fair share of the total value of the items. We'll calculate the total value of all items as perceived by each agent and then distribute them to balance the perceived values as closely as possible.

First, let's calculate the total value for each agent:

- Agent 0: 60 + 66 + 57 + 69 + 43 + 94 + 34 + 95 + 40 = 558
- Agent 1: 18 + 49 + 57 + 9 + 24 + 88 + 67 + 44 + 3 = 359

Now, let's distribute the items to balance these values:

1. Agent 0 has a higher total value, so we'll start allocating the highest valued items from Agent 1's perspective to Agent 1, and the highest valued items from Agent 0's perspective to Agent 0.

2. Allocate items:
   - Agent 1 values item 5 at 88, which is the highest for them. Agent 1 gets item 5.
   - Agent 1 values item 6 at 67, which is the second highest. Agent 1 gets item 6.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 49. Agent 1 gets item 1.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 57. Agent 1 gets item 2.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 at 44. Agent 1 gets item 7.

   After these allocations, Agent 1 has items 5, 6, 1, 2, and 7.

3. Allocate the remaining items to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 gets items 0, 3, 4, and 8.

Now, let's check the new valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, 4, and 8:
  - Total value = 60 + 69 + 43 + 40 = 212

- Agent 1 receives items 5, 6, 1, 2, and 7:
  - Total value = 88 + 67 + 49 + 57 + 44 = 305

These allocations are reasonably balanced, given the constraints.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 8],
    "1": [5, 6, 1, 2, 7]
}
```
