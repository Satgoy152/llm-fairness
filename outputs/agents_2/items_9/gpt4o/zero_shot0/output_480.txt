Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  47  49  64  18  62  88  76  76
1  36   7  53  11  63  84  28   0  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim for a distribution that maximizes total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a similar number of items. We will evaluate the value each agent places on each item and try to distribute them to balance total value and item count.

Let's consider the valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 10, Agent 1 values at 36
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 47, Agent 1 values at 7
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 49, Agent 1 values at 53
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 64, Agent 1 values at 11
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 18, Agent 1 values at 63
- Item 5: Agent 0 values at 62, Agent 1 values at 84
- Item 6: Agent 0 values at 88, Agent 1 values at 28
- Item 7: Agent 0 values at 76, Agent 1 values at 0
- Item 8: Agent 0 values at 76, Agent 1 values at 97

Let's distribute the items:

1. **Highest Value Preference**: Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring a somewhat balanced item count.
2. **Balancing Quantity**: Reassign items where necessary to ensure each agent has a balanced number of items.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Give item 0 to Agent 1 (36 vs. 10)
- Give item 1 to Agent 0 (47 vs. 7)
- Give item 2 to Agent 1 (53 vs. 49)
- Give item 3 to Agent 0 (64 vs. 11)
- Give item 4 to Agent 1 (63 vs. 18)
- Give item 5 to Agent 1 (84 vs. 62)
- Give item 6 to Agent 0 (88 vs. 28)
- Give item 7 to Agent 0 (76 vs. 0)
- Give item 8 to Agent 1 (97 vs. 76)

Now check the balance:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 3, 6, 7 (4 items)
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8 (5 items)

To balance the number of items more evenly, we can adjust slightly:

- Swap item 4 from Agent 1 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 2, 5, 8

This results in each agent receiving 4 items, which is a balanced distribution.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 8]
}
```
