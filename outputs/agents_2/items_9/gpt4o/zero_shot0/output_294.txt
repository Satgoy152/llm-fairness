Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  50  89  23  91  58  76  65  30
1  17  82  76  66  86  48  62  94  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is as balanced as possible. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. List all items with their valuations for both agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuations between agents.
3. Allocate items to the agent who values it more, while keeping the total valuation difference minimized.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Item 4: Agent 0 values it 91, Agent 1 values it 86. Difference = 5.
2. Item 7: Agent 0 values it 65, Agent 1 values it 94. Difference = 29.
3. Item 0: Agent 0 values it 29, Agent 1 values it 17. Difference = 12.
4. Item 1: Agent 0 values it 50, Agent 1 values it 82. Difference = 32.
5. Item 5: Agent 0 values it 58, Agent 1 values it 48. Difference = 10.
6. Item 3: Agent 0 values it 23, Agent 1 values it 66. Difference = 43.
7. Item 8: Agent 0 values it 30, Agent 1 values it 27. Difference = 3.
8. Item 6: Agent 0 values it 76, Agent 1 values it 62. Difference = 14.
9. Item 2: Agent 0 values it 89, Agent 1 values it 76. Difference = 13.

Allocations based on valuation difference:

- Agent 0 gets: 4, 0, 5, 8, 6
- Agent 1 gets: 7, 1, 3, 2

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 5, 8, 6],
    "1": [7, 1, 3, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items.
