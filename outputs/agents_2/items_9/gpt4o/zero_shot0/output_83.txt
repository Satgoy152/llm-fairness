Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  68  10  22  87  87  45  38  73
1  99  32  78  60  25  91   6  94  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to balance the total valuation each agent gets from the items assigned to them. Here's how we can approach this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Use a strategy to distribute items such that the difference in total valuation between the agents is minimized.

Let's calculate the total value each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0's total value: 51 + 68 + 10 + 22 + 87 + 87 + 45 + 38 + 73 = 481
- Agent 1's total value: 99 + 32 + 78 + 60 + 25 + 91 + 6 + 94 + 30 = 515

Now, we want to allocate the items in a manner that the total values assigned to each agent are as close as possible.

Let's try to greedily assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while keeping track of the balance:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (99 vs 51), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (68 vs 32), assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (78 vs 10), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (60 vs 22), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (87 vs 25), assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (91 vs 87), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (45 vs 6), assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (94 vs 38), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (73 vs 30), assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the total values for each agent:

- Agent 0: 68 + 87 + 45 + 73 = 273
- Agent 1: 99 + 78 + 60 + 91 + 94 = 422

There is still a significant imbalance, so let's adjust slightly by reassigning some items:

- Reassign Item 5 to Agent 0. 
- Reassign Item 6 to Agent 1.

Now, let's recalculate the total:

- Agent 0: 68 + 87 + 45 + 73 + 91 = 364
- Agent 1: 99 + 78 + 60 + 94 + 6 = 337

This allocation is more balanced. Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 7]
}
```
