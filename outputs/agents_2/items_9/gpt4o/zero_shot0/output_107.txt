Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  73  57  43  19  26  15  31  49
1   6  55  37  78  68  42  77  26  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to balance the overall valuation each agent receives. One approach to achieve this is to use the Adjusted Winner procedure or any other fair division algorithm that considers the individual valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to balance the allocations based on valuations:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items.
2. Try to allocate items such that the sum of the valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's see the calculations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 97 + 73 + 57 + 43 + 19 + 26 + 15 + 31 + 49 = 410
- Agent 1's total valuation: 6 + 55 + 37 + 78 + 68 + 42 + 77 + 26 + 42 = 431

The goal is to allocate the items such that both agents get close to half of the total valuation, which is (410 + 431) / 2 = 420.5.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent one by one until we reach a balanced distribution.

- First, assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 97). Agent 0 now has 97.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 78). Agent 1 now has 78.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 73). Agent 0 now has 170.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 77). Agent 1 now has 155.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 57). Agent 0 now has 227.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 68). Agent 1 now has 223.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 42). Agent 1 now has 265.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value 31). Agent 0 now has 258.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (value 49). Agent 0 now has 307.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 77). Agent 1 now has 342.

After the above steps, we have fairly allocated the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 7, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives as closely as possible, given the discrete nature of the items.
