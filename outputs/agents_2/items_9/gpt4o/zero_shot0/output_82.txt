Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  40  61  73  83  97  34  58  64
1  47  30  65  23  88  23   1   4  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 30 65 23 88 23  1  4 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a balanced share of items. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List Valuations**: We have the valuation table given:
   - Agent 0: [77, 40, 61, 73, 83, 97, 34, 58, 64]
   - Agent 1: [47, 30, 65, 23, 88, 23, 1, 4, 44]

2. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Item**: For each item, calculate the sum of valuations from both agents.
   - Item 0: 77 + 47 = 124
   - Item 1: 40 + 30 = 70
   - Item 2: 61 + 65 = 126
   - Item 3: 73 + 23 = 96
   - Item 4: 83 + 88 = 171
   - Item 5: 97 + 23 = 120
   - Item 6: 34 + 1 = 35
   - Item 7: 58 + 4 = 62
   - Item 8: 64 + 44 = 108

3. **Sort Items by Total Valuation**: Sort items in descending order based on the total valuation.
   - [4, 2, 0, 5, 8, 3, 1, 7, 6]

4. **Allocate Items**: We aim to balance the number of items allocated and the valuation sum for each agent.
   - Allocate the highest-total-valuation item to the agent who values it more, and continue down the list.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [0, 1, 3, 5, 8]
     - Valuation: 77 + 40 + 73 + 97 + 64 = 351
   - Agent 1: [2, 4, 6, 7]
     - Valuation: 65 + 88 + 1 + 4 = 158

The allocations are fairly distributed based on the items' total valuations and each agent's preference.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5, 8],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
