Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  75  66  80  77  14  45  22  78
1  63   3  11  74  86  47  85  35  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a bundle of items such that their total valuation of the items is as equal as possible. To do this, we can use a greedy allocation approach that aims to balance the total valuations for each agent as items are allocated.

Let's calculate the allocation:

1. First, list all items with their valuations for both agents:

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 values it at 63
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 values it at 3
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 values it at 11
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 values it at 74
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 values it at 86
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 values it at 47
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 values it at 85
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 35
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 values it at 79

2. We will allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most, but in such a way that we try to balance the total valuations.

3. Start allocating items:

   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 (higher value: 86)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (higher value: 80)
   - Allocate Item 8 to Agent 1 (higher value: 79)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (higher value: 75)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (higher value: 63)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (higher value: 66)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1 (higher value: 85)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 (higher value: 47)
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 0 (higher value: 22)

4. Calculate total valuations for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 80 (Item 3) + 75 (Item 1) + 66 (Item 2) + 22 (Item 7) = 243
   - Agent 1: 86 (Item 4) + 79 (Item 8) + 63 (Item 0) + 85 (Item 6) + 47 (Item 5) = 360

5. The allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 2, 7],
    "1": [4, 8, 0, 6, 5]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the total valuations for each agent as much as possible given the constraints.
