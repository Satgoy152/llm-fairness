Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  14  76  87  26  79  11  61  11
1  14  68  13  14  28  86  74  11  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can employ a method that tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Use a greedy algorithm to allocate items to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total valuation:

- Agent 0: 55 + 14 + 76 + 87 + 26 + 79 + 11 + 61 + 11 = 420
- Agent 1: 14 + 68 + 13 + 14 + 28 + 86 + 74 + 11 + 39 = 347

Now, let's allocate items trying to balance the total value:

1. Sort items by the difference in valuation between the two agents in descending order.
2. Assign items to the agent who values them more until the total value for each agent is balanced.

Let's execute this:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value | Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) |
|------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| 3    | 87            | 14            | 73                              |
| 2    | 76            | 13            | 63                              |
| 0    | 55            | 14            | 41                              |
| 6    | 11            | 74            | -63                             |
| 8    | 11            | 39            | -28                             |
| 4    | 26            | 28            | -2                              |
| 1    | 14            | 68            | -54                             |
| 5    | 79            | 86            | -7                              |
| 7    | 61            | 11            | 50                              |

Based on the sorted list and differences, we allocate these items:

1. Agent 0 gets items: 3, 2, 0, 7
2. Agent 1 gets items: 6, 8, 4, 1, 5

Recalculate valuations to ensure balance:

- Agent 0: 87 + 76 + 55 + 61 = 279
- Agent 1: 74 + 39 + 28 + 68 + 86 = 295

This is a fair allocation given the constraints. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 0, 7],
    "1": [6, 8, 4, 1, 5]
}
```
