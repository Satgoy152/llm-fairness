Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  47  67  20  79  11  15  13  99
1  44  76  34  35  56  94  88  45  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring both have an equal or nearly equal number of items. Given that there are 9 items, one agent will receive 5 items and the other will receive 4 items.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 19 + 47 + 67 + 20 + 79 + 11 + 15 + 13 + 99 = 370
- Agent 1: 44 + 76 + 34 + 35 + 56 + 94 + 88 + 45 + 44 = 516

Next, let's aim to allocate items to maximize the total perceived value for each agent while keeping the distribution fair. We need to consider how each item's value differs between the two agents.

To distribute the items, we can start by allocating the highest value items to the agent who values them more, while maintaining an even distribution in terms of the number of items.

1. Compare the value each agent assigns to each item and allocate to the agent with the higher valuation, ensuring the total number of items per agent is balanced.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (44 vs. 19) -> Allocate to Agent 1
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (76 vs. 47) -> Allocate to Agent 1
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (67 vs. 34) -> Allocate to Agent 0
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (35 vs. 20) -> Allocate to Agent 1
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (79 vs. 56) -> Allocate to Agent 0
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (94 vs. 11) -> Allocate to Agent 1
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (88 vs. 15) -> Allocate to Agent 1
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (45 vs. 13) -> Allocate to Agent 1
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (99 vs. 44) -> Allocate to Agent 0

Since we need to ensure that agent 0 receives 4 items and agent 1 receives 5 items, let's adjust the allocation:

- Swap Item 1 (more valuable to Agent 1) with Item 2 (more valuable to Agent 0)
- Swap Item 6 (more valuable to Agent 1) with Item 4 (more valuable to Agent 0)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 0, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the number of items and the value derived by each agent.
