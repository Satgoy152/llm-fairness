Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  32  97  84  94  70   6  14   5
1  55  44  36  31  45  86  95  89  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total value for each item for both agents.
2. Compare the valuations for each item and allocate the item to the agent who values it more, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
3. If there is a tie in the value assigned by both agents, the item can be allocated to either agent to balance the total number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values items: [27, 32, 97, 84, 94, 70, 6, 14, 5]
- Agent 1 values items: [55, 44, 36, 31, 45, 86, 95, 89, 24]

1. Compare values for each item and allocate accordingly:

   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (55 vs 27). Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (44 vs 32). Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (97 vs 36). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (84 vs 31). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (94 vs 45). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (86 vs 70). Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (95 vs 6). Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (89 vs 14). Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 8: Agent 1 values it more (24 vs 5). Allocate to Agent 1.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [2, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8]

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
