Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  74  38  98  44   7  36  95  73
1  38  45  49  95  13  47   0  53  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [38 45 49 95 13 47  0 53 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll look to balance the allocation so that both agents feel they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the valuation table for clarity:

```
Agent 0: [36, 74, 38, 98, 44, 7, 36, 95, 73]
Agent 1: [38, 45, 49, 95, 13, 47, 0, 53, 91]
```

We will use a method that considers both balanced distribution and maximization of agent satisfaction. We can use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it more, but we need to ensure that both agents receive a fair number of items.

Here's a possible allocation method:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.
3. If both agents end up with an unequal number of items, adjust by reassigning some items that have the least difference in valuation.

Let's implement this:

1. Calculate differences in valuations for each item.
2. Sort items based on these differences.
3. Allocate items to agents based on sorted differences while maintaining a balance in the number of items.

Let's do this step by step:

- Items with higher valuation differences favor one agent over the other and should be assigned to the agent with the higher valuation.
- If the difference is small and balance is needed, we may need to reassign.

Following this process, let's allocate the items:

- Item assignments based on higher valuation:
  - Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
  - Agent 1: Items 2, 5, 8

This gives Agent 0 six items and Agent 1 three items, which isn't balanced. To balance, we can swap some items:

- Swap item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it lower, but to balance count).
- Swap item 7 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 0 values it higher, but balances the count better).

Upon balance adjustment, we can allocate as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This results in a balanced allocation with each agent receiving four items, while still considering the valuations.
