Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44   0   2  79  60  33  54  79  85
1  80  63  76  33  23  34  72   4  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [80 63 76 33 23 34 72  4 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's consider a simple fair allocation approach that aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 44 + 0 + 2 + 79 + 60 + 33 + 54 + 79 + 85 = 436
- Agent 1: 80 + 63 + 76 + 33 + 23 + 34 + 72 + 4 + 93 = 478

Now, let's allocate the items one by one, trying to ensure that the allocation is fair based on the agents' valuations.

1. Both agents value item 8 highly, but agent 1 values it at 93, which is the highest single valuation. So, allocate item 8 to agent 1.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 highly at 80, so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 0 values item 7 at 79, similarly to item 3, but let's allocate item 7 to agent 0 because agent 1 already received high-valued items.
4. Allocate item 3 to agent 0, who also values it at 79.
5. Allocate item 2 to agent 1, who values it at 76.
6. Allocate item 4 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it at 60 compared to agent 1's 23.
7. Allocate item 6 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it at 72 compared to agent 0's 54.
8. Allocate item 5 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it at 33 compared to agent 1's 34.
9. Finally, allocate item 1 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it at 63 compared to agent 0's 0.

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives. 

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6, 8]
}
```
