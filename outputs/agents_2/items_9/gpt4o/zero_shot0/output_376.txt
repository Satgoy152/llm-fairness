Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  25  51  37  59  74  22  15  38
1   4  53   0  42  24  63  11  37  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can employ a strategy to approximate a fair allocation, considering each agent's valuations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate the total value of all items for each agent**:
   - For Agent 0: 60 + 25 + 51 + 37 + 59 + 74 + 22 + 15 + 38 = 381
   - For Agent 1: 4 + 53 + 0 + 42 + 24 + 63 + 11 + 37 + 94 = 328

2. **Allocate items based on maximizing each agent's individual value**:
   - Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent until all items are distributed.

3. **Allocate items**:
   - Sort items based on the difference in valuation for the agents and allocate to the agent with the higher value for that item.

Following these steps, we arrive at the following allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6 
- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 3, 7, 8

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share considering their valuations.

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 7, 8]
}
```
