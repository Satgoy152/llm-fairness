Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  93  44  48  86  10  11  63  29
1   6   7  88  99  85  43  45  59  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. In this case, let's use a strategy where we allocate items in a way that balances the total value as evenly as possible between both agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 88 + 93 + 44 + 48 + 86 + 10 + 11 + 63 + 29 = 472
   - Agent 1: 6 + 7 + 88 + 99 + 85 + 43 + 45 + 59 + 41 = 473

2. Since the total valuations are almost equal, we can proceed to allocate items by greedily assigning items to the agent that values them more, ensuring each agent gets a fair number of items.

3. Allocate items one by one, favoring the agent with the higher valuation for each item, while keeping the balance as even as possible.

Here's the allocation based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent:

- Item 0: Allocate to Agent 0 (88 vs 6)
- Item 1: Allocate to Agent 0 (93 vs 7)
- Item 2: Allocate to Agent 1 (88 vs 44)
- Item 3: Allocate to Agent 1 (99 vs 48)
- Item 4: Allocate to Agent 0 (86 vs 85)
- Item 5: Allocate to Agent 1 (43 vs 10)
- Item 6: Allocate to Agent 1 (45 vs 11)
- Item 7: Allocate to Agent 0 (63 vs 59)
- Item 8: Allocate to Agent 0 (29 vs 41)

Now, letâ€™s present these allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 4, 7, and 8, while Agent 1 receives items 2, 3, 5, and 6. This allocation aims to balance the total valuation for each agent as evenly as possible given the constraints.
