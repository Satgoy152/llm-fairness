Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  92  47  56  97  56  47  89  81
1  38  82  65  81  54  98  70  66  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of both agents based on their valuations. This is a type of optimization problem often approached using methods such as the "Envy-Free" or "Max-Min Fairness" strategies.

Let's proceed with a simple allocation strategy by considering each agent's preferences and trying to balance the total value allocated to each agent.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 97, while Agent 1 values it at 54. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 98, while Agent 0 values it at 56. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 92, while Agent 1 values it at 82. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 89, while Agent 1 values it at 66. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 81, while Agent 0 values it at 56. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 65, while Agent 0 values it at 47. Allocate to Agent 1.
7. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 81, while Agent 1 values it at 58. Allocate to Agent 0.
8. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 70, while Agent 0 values it at 47. Allocate to Agent 1.
9. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 38, while Agent 0 values it at 17. Allocate to Agent 1.

**Allocations:**

This allocation strategy attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

Here, Agent 0 receives items 1, 4, 7, and 8, while Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6. This allocation seeks to balance the total value received by each agent based on their preferences.
