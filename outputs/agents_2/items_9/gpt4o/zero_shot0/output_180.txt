Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6   7   8
0  11  17  80  67  84   4  4  75  82
1  72  17  29   3  40  71  4  86  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to balance the overall value each agent receives. One approach is to assign items such that the total value is as equal as possible between the two agents. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item across both agents.
2. Assign items to agents to balance the total value.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values: [11, 17, 80, 67, 84, 4, 4, 75, 82]
- Agent 1 values: [72, 17, 29, 3, 40, 71, 4, 86, 75]

Total values for each item:
- Item 0: 11 + 72 = 83
- Item 1: 17 + 17 = 34
- Item 2: 80 + 29 = 109
- Item 3: 67 + 3 = 70
- Item 4: 84 + 40 = 124
- Item 5: 4 + 71 = 75
- Item 6: 4 + 4 = 8
- Item 7: 75 + 86 = 161
- Item 8: 82 + 75 = 157

Allocate items to balance the total value:

- High-value items like 7 and 8 can be split between the agents.
- Try to keep the total value as balanced as possible.

A reasonable allocation might be:

Agent 0: [2, 3, 6, 8]  
Agent 1: [0, 1, 4, 5, 7]

This allocation considers both agents' valuations and attempts to fairly distribute items so that the total value for each agent is balanced.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
