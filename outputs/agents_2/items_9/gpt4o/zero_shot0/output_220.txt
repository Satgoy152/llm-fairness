Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  97  86  55  99  13  57  29  90
1  24  16  81  47  13  28  13  71  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize the total perceived value each agent receives. One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm, assigning each item to the agent who values it most. Here's how the allocation would look:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 values it at 24. Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 values it at 16. Assign to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 values it at 81. Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 values it at 47. Assign to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 values it at 13. Assign to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 values it at 28. Assign to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 values it at 13. Assign to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 29, Agent 1 values it at 71. Assign to Agent 1.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 values it at 51. Assign to Agent 0.

This allocation gives Agent 0 seven items and Agent 1 two items. Since the total number of items is odd, it's not possible to split them equally, but this allocation maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [5, 7]
}
```
