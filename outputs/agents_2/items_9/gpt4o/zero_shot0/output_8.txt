Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  12   6  91  74  69  38  29   8
1  36  83  34  92  21  95  49  67  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that maximizes the satisfaction or value each agent derives from their allocated items. This involves considering the total value each agent assigns to the items, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's go through the process of making an allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: 
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 86 + 12 + 6 + 91 + 74 + 69 + 38 + 29 + 8 = 413
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 36 + 83 + 34 + 92 + 21 + 95 + 49 + 67 + 91 = 568

2. **Determine Allocation Strategy**:
   - Since there are 9 items, each agent should receive around 4-5 items.
   - We should try to allocate items in such a way that each agent's total received valuation is maximized for them.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Start by giving each agent the items where they have significantly higher valuations compared to the other agent.
   - Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 3 (91), so we give them item 3.
   - Agent 1 has a high valuation for items 5 (95) and 8 (91), so we give them these items.
   - Continue this process until all items are allocated.

After making allocations based on the highest valuations, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fair distribution based on the agents' preferences and valuations. Agent 0 receives items that maximize their value, and Agent 1 receives items that maximize their value, as per their individual valuations.
