Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  49  16  13  85  68  45   8   3
1  24  17  78  75  50  98  49  57  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the overall satisfaction of both agents. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it more, while ensuring each agent gets a similar number of items.

Here's a step-by-step plan to achieve this:

1. Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the item index and the difference in valuation between the two agents for that item. Calculate this difference as the absolute difference between the valuations of the two agents for each item.

2. Sort this list in descending order of differences. This will prioritize items that have a larger valuation difference, ensuring that more valuable items to one agent are allocated to them.

3. Initialize two empty lists to store the items allocated to each agent.

4. Iterate through the sorted list and allocate each item to the agent who values it more. Keep track of the number of items allocated to each agent to ensure a fair distribution.

5. If at any point the distribution becomes uneven (one agent has more items), allocate the next item to the agent with fewer items, regardless of the valuation.

Following this approach, we'll allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair number of items while also considering their preferences.
