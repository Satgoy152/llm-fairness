Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  11  94   7  70  54   7  25  72
1  20  54   0  21  14  17  15  48  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a fairness criterion such as maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. A simple and straightforward way to approach this problem is to utilize a "greedy" strategy, where we allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that both agents receive roughly an equal number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 72 + 11 + 94 + 7 + 70 + 54 + 7 + 25 + 72 = 412
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 20 + 54 + 0 + 21 + 14 + 17 + 15 + 48 + 13 = 202

2. Allocate items by checking the valuations for each item and assigning it to the agent with the higher valuation for that item, while ensuring that the distribution remains fair.

3. Keep track of the number of items each agent receives to ensure fairness.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (72 vs 20), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (54 vs 11), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (94 vs 0), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (21 vs 7), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (70 vs 14), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (54 vs 17), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (15 vs 7), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (48 vs 25), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (72 vs 13), allocate to Agent 0.

After ensuring the allocation is balanced and each agent receives a fair number of items, we get the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, 4, 5, and 8, while Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, 6, and 7.
