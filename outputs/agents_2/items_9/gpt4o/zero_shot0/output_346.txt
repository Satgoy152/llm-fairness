Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52   4  95  95   8  38  63  57  22
1  50  24  48  15  97  15  77  89  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value assigned to each agent, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to do it:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it more. This approach is known as the "greedy" method.
3. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's go through the calculations:

### Valuations Table:
```
  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0 52   4  95  95   8  38  63  57  22
1 50  24  48  15  97  15  77  89  26
```

### Step-by-step Allocation:
- Compare valuations for each item between the two agents.
- Assign each item to the agent with the higher valuation.

#### Item Allocations:
- Item 0: Agent 0 (52 vs. 50)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (24 vs. 4)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (95 vs. 48)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (95 vs. 15)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (97 vs. 8)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (38 vs. 15)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (77 vs. 63)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (89 vs. 57)
- Item 8: Agent 1 (26 vs. 22)

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuation of the items.
