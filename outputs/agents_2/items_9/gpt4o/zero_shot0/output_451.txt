Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  49  84  77  23   6  82  79  60
1  68  73  81  68  31  24  84  40  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [68 73 81 68 31 24 84 40 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the total value of items each agent receives is as balanced as possible, considering their individual valuations. Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Agent 0's Valuation:
- Item 0: 91
- Item 1: 49
- Item 2: 84
- Item 3: 77
- Item 4: 23
- Item 5: 6
- Item 6: 82
- Item 7: 79
- Item 8: 60

### Agent 1's Valuation:
- Item 0: 68
- Item 1: 73
- Item 2: 81
- Item 3: 68
- Item 4: 31
- Item 5: 24
- Item 6: 84
- Item 7: 40
- Item 8: 75

Let's allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while trying to keep the total values balanced.

#### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 91
   - Agent 1 values it at 68
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 73
   - Allocate to Agent 1

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 84
   - Agent 1 values it at 81
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 77
   - Agent 1 values it at 68
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 23
   - Agent 1 values it at 31
   - Allocate to Agent 1

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 6
   - Agent 1 values it at 24
   - Allocate to Agent 1

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 82
   - Agent 1 values it at 84
   - Allocate to Agent 1

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 79
   - Agent 1 values it at 40
   - Allocate to Agent 0

9. **Item 8**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 60
   - Agent 1 values it at 75
   - Allocate to Agent 1

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations, giving each agent a fair share of the items.
