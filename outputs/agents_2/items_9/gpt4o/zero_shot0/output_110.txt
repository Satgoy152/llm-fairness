Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  72  94  43  90  99  63  52  10
1  61   3  98  42  67  12  58  21  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that both agents get an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items, one agent will receive 5 items and the other will receive 4 items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate total values for each item by both agents to identify high-value items for both.**
   - For each item, compute the sum of the valuations by both agents.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Give each agent the items where they have the highest comparative valuation over the other agent.

3. **Fine-tuning:**
   - Adjust allocations by swapping items to ensure the distribution of the number of items is 4 and 5 while keeping the allocation as fair as possible.

Here's the breakdown:

- Calculate the value difference for each item for both agents to identify which items are relatively more valuable to them.
- Allocate items by giving priority to each agent based on where they have the highest value difference.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Initial Assignments by Preference:**
   - Agent 0 gets items: 5, 4, 3 — high value differences in favor of Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 gets items: 2, 8, 1 — high value differences in favor of Agent 1.

2. **Adjust to balance the number of items:**
   - To balance out, swap items based on lesser value difference until one agent has 5 items and the other has 4.

After following this process, the final fair allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation gives a balanced distribution of items based on the values that each agent places on them.
