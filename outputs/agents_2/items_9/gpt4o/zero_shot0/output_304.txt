Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  15  47  66   1   7  62  53  80
1  89  33  34  77  81  90  95  51  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to balance the total value each agent receives. This is known as a fair division problem, and one common approach is to use the max-min fair allocation method, which seeks to maximize the minimum value that any agent receives.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
- Agent 0's total valuation: 14 + 15 + 47 + 66 + 1 + 7 + 62 + 53 + 80 = 345
- Agent 1's total valuation: 89 + 33 + 34 + 77 + 81 + 90 + 95 + 51 + 70 = 620

Now, we'll try to allocate the items so that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

One possible allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 5, 7, 8]
  - Values: [66, 7, 53, 80]
  - Total value: 206

- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]
  - Values: [89, 33, 34, 81, 95]
  - Total value: 414

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations, but due to the total valuation differences, it may not be perfectly equal. However, both agents receive a fair share based on their valuation preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
