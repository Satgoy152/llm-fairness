Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  50  30  90  21  56  58  57   9
1  79  47  98  87   7  82  69  58  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim to balance the overall satisfaction each agent receives from their allocated items. A common approach is to use a method like maximizing the minimum satisfaction or ensuring that the total value each agent receives is as equal as possible.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each item and then try to distribute them in a way that aims for fairness:

Agent 0's total valuation: 54 + 50 + 30 + 90 + 21 + 56 + 58 + 57 + 9 = 425  
Agent 1's total valuation: 79 + 47 + 98 + 87 + 7 + 82 + 69 + 58 + 47 = 574  

We will allocate items by comparing the valuations and trying to balance the total value for each agent.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning each agent their highest-valued items from their perspective.

2. Balance the total valuation by switching items if necessary to minimize the difference in total valuations between the agents.

After following this strategy, a fair allocation could look like this:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8]
- Agent 1 receives items: [2, 3, 7]

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total satisfaction each agent gets based on their valuations.
