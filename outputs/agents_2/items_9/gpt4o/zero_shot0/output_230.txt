Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  38   4  63   7  48  93  18  36
1  46  92  81  69  80  86  90  36   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method such as maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.

2. Try to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent.

3. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's calculate the total valuations:

- Agent 0: 1 + 38 + 4 + 63 + 7 + 48 + 93 + 18 + 36 = 308
- Agent 1: 46 + 92 + 81 + 69 + 80 + 86 + 90 + 36 + 2 = 582

Given the valuations, we should aim to allocate items to maximize each agent's total value, considering the requirement that each agent gets an integer number of items.

After analyzing the table, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 (0): [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
- Agent 1 (1): [3, 6, 7]

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items (6 for Agent 0 and 3 for Agent 1) while maximizing their total valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [3, 6, 7]
}
```
