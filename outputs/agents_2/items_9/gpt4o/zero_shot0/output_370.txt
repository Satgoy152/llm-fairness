Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  68  91  73  93  98  48  27  58
1  28  94  43  33  78  59   8  53  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. This involves assigning items to agents such that the sum of their valuations is as equal as possible. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 74 + 68 + 91 + 73 + 93 + 98 + 48 + 27 + 58 = 630
   - Agent 1: 28 + 94 + 43 + 33 + 78 + 59 + 8 + 53 + 90 = 486

2. Allocate items to balance the total valuation as equally as possible:

   - Start by allocating high-value items that each agent values more.
   - Agent 0 values items: 5, 4, 2, 0, 3, 1, 8, 6, 7 (in descending preference based on value).
   - Agent 1 values items: 1, 8, 4, 5, 2, 3, 7, 0, 6 (in descending preference based on value).

3. Assign items to balance the total valuation for each agent:

   - Assign items to Agent 0: [0, 2, 3, 5, 6]
     - Total valuation for Agent 0: 74 + 91 + 73 + 98 + 48 = 384

   - Assign items to Agent 1: [1, 4, 7, 8]
     - Total valuation for Agent 1: 94 + 78 + 53 + 90 = 315

4. Check if the allocation is balanced:
   - Agent 0: 384
   - Agent 1: 315

   While this allocation is not perfectly balanced, it is one of the more balanced scenarios given the constraints of assigning an integer number of items to each agent.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
