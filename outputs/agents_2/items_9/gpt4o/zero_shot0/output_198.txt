Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  89  73  43  59  94  58  13  73
1  26  82  64  89   3  64  91  93  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the satisfaction of agents based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that the total number of items each agent receives is balanced.

Here's the step-by-step process for the allocation:

1. **Item Valuation Matrix:**
   - Agent 0's valuations: [10, 89, 73, 43, 59, 94, 58, 13, 73]
   - Agent 1's valuations: [26, 82, 64, 89, 3, 64, 91, 93, 44]

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Items:**
   - There are 9 items in total.

3. **Goal:**
   - Each agent should receive approximately the same number of items. Since 9 is an odd number, one agent will get 5 items and the other will get 4.

4. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Evaluate each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most. 
   - If both agents value an item equally, allocate it to the agent with fewer items so far.
   - Continuously check the number of items each agent has to maintain balance.

5. **Perform the Allocation:**

   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (26 vs. 10) → Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (89 vs. 82) → Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (73 vs. 64) → Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (89 vs. 43) → Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (59 vs. 3) → Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (94 vs. 64) → Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (91 vs. 58) → Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (93 vs. 13) → Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (73 vs. 44) → Allocate to Agent 0.

6. **Check Allocation Balance:**
   - Agent 0 has 5 items: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
   - Agent 1 has 4 items: [0, 3, 6, 7]

7. **Output the Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations while keeping the distribution as balanced as possible.
