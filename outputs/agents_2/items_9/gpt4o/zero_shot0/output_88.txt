Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  10  55   7  38  57   5   4  46
1  72   4  33  79  35  34  60  77  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72  4 33 79 35 34 60 77 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's evaluate the items and consider each agent's preference:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** 99, 10, 55, 7, 38, 57, 5, 4, 46
2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** 72, 4, 33, 79, 35, 34, 60, 77, 33

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign items to the agent who values them significantly higher than the other, to maximize overall satisfaction.
- Try to balance the total valuation between both agents.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 at 72. Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 10, Agent 1 at 4. Assign to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 at 33. Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 7, Agent 1 at 79. Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 38, Agent 1 at 35. Assign to Agent 0 (slightly higher).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 at 34. Assign to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 at 60. Assign to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 4, Agent 1 at 77. Assign to Agent 1.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 46, Agent 1 at 33. Assign to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 6, 7]

Now, let's format this in JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to give each agent a satisfactory share based on their respective item valuations.
