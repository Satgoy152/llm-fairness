Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  72  43  56  32  59  60  85   0
1  99  88  56  87  73  27  31  14  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that the number of items allocated to each agent is roughly equal. Given there are 9 items, each agent should ideally receive around 4 or 5 items.

Let's analyze the values and try to allocate them accordingly:

1. Start by identifying the highest value items for each agent and try to allocate them to the agent who values them the most, while maintaining a balance in the number of items.

2. Check the remaining items and allocate them to maintain balance both in total value and number of items.

Here is a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 1 (value 72)
  - Item 3 (value 56)
  - Item 5 (value 59)
  - Item 6 (value 60)
  - Item 7 (value 85)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0 (value 99)
  - Item 2 (value 56)
  - Item 4 (value 73)
  - Item 8 (value 53)

This allocation ensures that both agents receive 4 or 5 items and that the total valuation is reasonably balanced.

Here's the JSON format for this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 8]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7, while Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, 4, and 8. This allocation maintains a balance in the number of items and attempts to fairly distribute the total valuation between the two agents.
