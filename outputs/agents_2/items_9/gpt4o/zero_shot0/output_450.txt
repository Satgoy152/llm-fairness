Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  90  11  96  73  11  81  96  31
1  75  21   2  34  71  18  62  19  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [75 21  2 34 71 18 62 19 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize each agentâ€™s total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items:
   - Agent 0: 26 + 90 + 11 + 96 + 73 + 11 + 81 + 96 + 31 = 515
   - Agent 1: 75 + 21 + 2 + 34 + 71 + 18 + 62 + 19 + 73 = 375

2. Allocate items such that the overall value is maximized for both agents, while maintaining a balance in the number of items and their relative valuations.

3. Consider each item, deciding which agent values it more, and allocate accordingly.

Using the above considerations, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has higher valuations on items: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Agent 1 has higher valuations on items: 2, 4, 8

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 8]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance both the total valuation and the number of items each agent receives.
