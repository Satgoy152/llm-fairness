Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  34   4  86  15  26  70  63  29
1   9  39  62  70  55  42  67  79  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations of the items. One common method is to use a "greedy algorithm" that assigns items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of the items.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent across all items.
2. Assign items one by one to the agent who values them most, while ensuring each agent gets approximately half of the total number of items.

**Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations**

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(43 + 34 + 4 + 86 + 15 + 26 + 70 + 63 + 29 = 370\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(9 + 39 + 62 + 70 + 55 + 42 + 67 + 79 + 70 = 493\)

**Step 2: Sort Items by Value Difference**

Compute the difference in valuations for each item and sort items by this difference in descending order:

- Item 3: Difference = 86 - 70 = 16 (Agent 0 prefers)
- Item 8: Difference = 29 - 70 = -41 (Agent 1 prefers)
- Item 6: Difference = 70 - 67 = 3 (Agent 0 prefers)
- Item 7: Difference = 63 - 79 = -16 (Agent 1 prefers)
- Item 2: Difference = 4 - 62 = -58 (Agent 1 prefers)
- Item 5: Difference = 26 - 42 = -16 (Agent 1 prefers)
- Item 4: Difference = 15 - 55 = -40 (Agent 1 prefers)
- Item 1: Difference = 34 - 39 = -5 (Agent 1 prefers)
- Item 0: Difference = 43 - 9 = 34 (Agent 0 prefers)

**Step 3: Allocate Items**

Allocate items by alternating between agents, starting with the agent who values the item more, while ensuring each agent ends up with approximately 5 items since there are 9 items in total.

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0
- Assign item 8 to Agent 1
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0

**Final Allocations**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6, 1],
    "1": [8, 7, 2, 5, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of items based on their valuations. Agent 0 receives 4 items, and Agent 1 receives 5 items, balancing the total valuation satisfaction for both.
