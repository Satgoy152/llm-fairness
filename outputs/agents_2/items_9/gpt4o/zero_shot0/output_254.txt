Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  73   1  79  27   4  35  63  91
1   2  12  85  40  47  42  88  52  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction for both agents. One common approach to this is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent that values it the most, ensuring that both agents receive an equal number of items (given there are 9 items, one agent will receive 5 items and the other will receive 4).

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction for the items:

1. Evaluate the value each agent places on each item.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring the distribution remains as balanced as possible.

Let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 71 vs 2).
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value 73 vs 12).
- Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 1 vs 85).
- Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 79 vs 40).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 27 vs 47).
- Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 4 vs 42).
- Assign item 6 to agent 1 (value 35 vs 88).
- Assign item 7 to agent 0 (value 63 vs 52).
- Assign item 8 to agent 0 (value 91 vs 36).

Now, check the balance of items:

- Agent 0 has items: [0, 1, 3, 7, 8] -> 5 items.
- Agent 1 has items: [2, 4, 5, 6] -> 4 items.

This allocation is balanced and maximizes the satisfaction based on the valuations provided.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
