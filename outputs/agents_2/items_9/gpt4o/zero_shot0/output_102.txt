Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  45  16  39  58  15  50  54  14
1  72  17  55  57  18  72  35  48  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we want to distribute them such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible. We'll use a simple approach to try and achieve this.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 76 + 45 + 16 + 39 + 58 + 15 + 50 + 54 + 14 = 367
- Agent 1's total valuation: 72 + 17 + 55 + 57 + 18 + 72 + 35 + 48 + 66 = 440

Next, let's allocate each item to the agent who values it more to maximize each agent's perceived total value. Here are the allocations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 72. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 at 17. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 16, Agent 1 at 55. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 at 57. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 at 18. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 at 72. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 at 35. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 at 48. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 at 66. Allocate to Agent 1.

After these allocations, the items are distributed as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 5, 8

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 8]
}
```
