Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  76  47  49  13  27  70  74  74
1  42  11  89  93  10  54  53  66  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can try to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their total valuation while keeping the total number of items as balanced as possible. 

Let's consider the following approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would receive if they got all items.
2. Use a greedy algorithm to allocate each item to the agent who values it more, while keeping the allocation balanced in terms of the number of items each agent gets.

Here is how the allocation can be done:

| Item | Agent 0 Valuation | Agent 1 Valuation | Allocated to Agent |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 0    | 31                | 42                | 1                  |
| 1    | 76                | 11                | 0                  |
| 2    | 47                | 89                | 1                  |
| 3    | 49                | 93                | 1                  |
| 4    | 13                | 10                | 0                  |
| 5    | 27                | 54                | 1                  |
| 6    | 70                | 53                | 0                  |
| 7    | 74                | 66                | 0                  |
| 8    | 74                | 73                | 0                  |

Based on this allocation, we aim to balance the number of items each agent receives while trying to maximize their total valuation.

Final allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items [1, 4, 6, 7, 8], and Agent 1 receives items [0, 2, 3, 5].
