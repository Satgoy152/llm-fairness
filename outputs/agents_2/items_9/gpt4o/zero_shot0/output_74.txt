Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  46  12  53  33  98  48  86  95
1  27  73  52  59  94  32  64  78  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction for both agents. One common approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while attempting to balance the number of items each agent receives.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it more (27 vs. 4), so assign it to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it more (73 vs. 46), so assign it to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it more (52 vs. 12), so assign it to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it more (53 vs. 59), so assign it to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it more (94 vs. 33), so assign it to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it more (98 vs. 32), so assign it to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it more (64 vs. 48), so assign it to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it more (86 vs. 78), so assign it to Agent 0.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it more (95 vs. 23), so assign it to Agent 0.

Now, we summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6

Both agents have 4 or 5 items, which is reasonably balanced given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
