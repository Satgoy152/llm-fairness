Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  90   8   9  14  37  43  66  20
1  13  29  68  71  31  44   4  14  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items in a manner that balances the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**  
   - Agent 0: 91, 90, 8, 9, 14, 37, 43, 66, 20 (Total = 378)
   - Agent 1: 13, 29, 68, 71, 31, 44, 4, 14, 53 (Total = 327)

2. **Fair Value Distribution:**  
   The total value of all items is 705 (378 + 327). Each agent should ideally receive a value close to half of this total, which is 352.5.

3. **Initial Allocation:**  
   We start by assigning items to the agent who values them more, while keeping track of the total value each agent receives.

4. **Iteratively Adjust Allocation:**  
   Adjust allocations to ensure each agent's total value is as close as possible to 352.5.

Given this approach, the allocation can be determined as follows:

- **Agent 0** values item 0 and 1 much higher than Agent 1, so they should receive those. Similarly, Agent 1 values item 2 and 3 significantly more, so they should receive those.
- The rest of the items can be assigned in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

After performing these adjustments, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 8]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the total valuations each agent receives while ensuring that each item is allocated to the agent who values it more, wherever possible.
