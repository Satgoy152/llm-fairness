Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  77  37  98  73  85  15  57  20
1  46  11   1  66  30  21  99  64  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. We'll use a method to ensure that both agents receive a fair share based on their preferences. This can be done by looking at the relative values each agent assigns to the items and distributing them accordingly.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:**

   - Agent 0: 47 + 77 + 37 + 98 + 73 + 85 + 15 + 57 + 20 = 509
   - Agent 1: 46 + 11 + 1 + 66 + 30 + 21 + 99 + 64 + 81 = 419

2. **Allocate items based on where each agent has a higher relative valuation:**

   - Items with higher value for Agent 0: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Items with higher value for Agent 1: 6, 7, 8

3. **Balance the allocation to ensure items are distributed evenly:**

   Since there are 9 items, let's attempt to give each agent a roughly equal number of items, or 4-5 items each. We'll start with the items where each agent has a higher valuation and adjust to balance the count:

   - Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5
   - Agent 1 receives items: 4, 6, 7, 8

This allocation gives each agent 4 or 5 items and tries to respect their valuation preferences as closely as possible. 

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide a fair distribution of items based on the agents' valuations.
