Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  83  48  55  24  99  38  59  90
1  67  27  56   8  28  48  73  32  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each of them receives a fair share of items. Here's a possible approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:** 
   - Agent 0's total valuation: \(47 + 83 + 48 + 55 + 24 + 99 + 38 + 59 + 90 = 543\)
   - Agent 1's total valuation: \(67 + 27 + 56 + 8 + 28 + 48 + 73 + 32 + 23 = 362\)

2. **Fair Allocation:** 
   - We will try to assign items to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent.

3. **Assign Items:** 
   - Assign items to maximize individual agent's total value while balancing the number of items:
     - Agent 0 values item 5 highest (99), then item 8 (90), then item 1 (83).
     - Agent 1 values item 6 highest (73), then item 0 (67), then item 2 (56).

4. **Allocation Strategy:** 
   - Agent 0 gets items: 5, 8, 1, 7, 3
   - Agent 1 gets items: 6, 0, 2, 4

5. **Check Total Items:** 
   - Both agents get 4 items each.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8, 1, 7, 3],
    "1": [6, 0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the number of items while considering the agents' individual valuations, thus ensuring fairness in distribution.
