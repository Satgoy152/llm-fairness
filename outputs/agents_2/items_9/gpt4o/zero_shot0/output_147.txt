Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  16  85   1  13  65  83  42  37
1  95  14  19  62  28  43  68  20  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we aim to maximize the total value of the items each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's consider an approach that uses the highest valuations as a guide for allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (89), Item 2 (85), Item 6 (83), Item 5 (65), Item 8 (37), Item 7 (42), Item 1 (16), Item 4 (13), Item 3 (1).

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (95), Item 3 (62), Item 6 (68), Item 5 (43), Item 8 (49), Item 7 (20), Item 4 (28), Item 1 (14), Item 2 (19).

To ensure that both agents are satisfied, we can allocate items by considering the higher valuation for each item when possible, while maintaining balance in the number of items allocated:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0, Item 2, Item 6, Item 7, Item 4
- **Agent 1**: Item 3, Item 5, Item 8, Item 1

This gives each agent four items, trying to maximize their respective valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6, 7, 4],
    "1": [3, 5, 8, 1]
}
``` 

This allocation seeks to balance the total value between the agents while ensuring they both receive an integer number of items.
