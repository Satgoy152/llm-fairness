Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79   3  47  98  90  86  65   1  99
1  63  39  71  58  76  15  39  98   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and try to balance the total value each agent receives. We will use a simple greedy approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation of each item by each agent.
2. Sort the items by the difference in valuations between the two agents.
3. Allocate items to the agent who values it more, while keeping track of the total value each agent receives.
4. Ensure each agent ends up with an equal or almost equal number of items if possible.

Let's go through the process:

1. Valuations by agent:
   - Agent 0: [79, 3, 47, 98, 90, 86, 65, 1, 99]
   - Agent 1: [63, 39, 71, 58, 76, 15, 39, 98, 3]

2. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: 79 (A0) vs 63 (A1) -> diff = 16
   - Item 1: 3 (A0) vs 39 (A1) -> diff = -36
   - Item 2: 47 (A0) vs 71 (A1) -> diff = -24
   - Item 3: 98 (A0) vs 58 (A1) -> diff = 40
   - Item 4: 90 (A0) vs 76 (A1) -> diff = 14
   - Item 5: 86 (A0) vs 15 (A1) -> diff = 71
   - Item 6: 65 (A0) vs 39 (A1) -> diff = 26
   - Item 7: 1 (A0) vs 98 (A1) -> diff = -97
   - Item 8: 99 (A0) vs 3 (A1) -> diff = 96

3. Sort by the absolute difference:
   - Item 7: diff = -97
   - Item 8: diff = 96
   - Item 5: diff = 71
   - Item 3: diff = 40
   - Item 1: diff = -36
   - Item 2: diff = -24
   - Item 6: diff = 26
   - Item 0: diff = 16
   - Item 4: diff = 14

4. Allocate items to agents:
   - Agent 1 gets Item 7 (higher valuation)
   - Agent 0 gets Item 8 (higher valuation)
   - Agent 0 gets Item 5 (higher valuation)
   - Agent 0 gets Item 3 (higher valuation)
   - Agent 1 gets Item 1 (higher valuation)
   - Agent 1 gets Item 2 (higher valuation)
   - Agent 0 gets Item 6 (higher valuation)
   - Agent 0 gets Item 0 (higher valuation)
   - Agent 0 gets Item 4 (higher valuation)

After allocation, we need to ensure each agent has an approximately equal number of items. Agent 0 has 6 items, and Agent 1 has 3 items. To balance the allocations, we can move one item from Agent 0 to Agent 1. Let's move Item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 since it's the least valuable to Agent 0 among their allocations.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 5, 3, 6, 0],
    "1": [7, 1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance both the number of items and the total value allocated to each agent.
