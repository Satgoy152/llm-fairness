Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  9  90  70  29  71  81  55  57
1  62  2  31  53  39  51  83  25  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [62  2 31 53 39 51 83 25 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a greedy approach where we allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 values it at 62.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 values it at 2.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 values it at 31.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 values it at 53.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 29, Agent 1 values it at 39.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 values it at 51.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 values it at 83.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 values it at 25.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

9. **Item 8**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 values it at 50.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

### Allocations:
Based on the above allocation process, here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 4, 6]
}
``` 

In this allocation, both agents receive items in a way that maximizes their respective valuations with an approximately fair distribution.
