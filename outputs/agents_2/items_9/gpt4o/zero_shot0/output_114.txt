Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  19  21  86  80  50  39  78  67
1  47  48  24  37  95  40  24  97  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring a relatively balanced distribution of items. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item:**  
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 514
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 462

2. **Allocate Items in a Balanced Manner:**
   - We aim to balance the total value given to each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Sort items by the difference in valuations between the two agents.
   - Allocate items to the agent with the higher valuation for that item, ensuring each agent ends up with an approximately equal number of items.

Here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 3, 5, 7, 8]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 2, 4, 6]

This allocation is balanced in terms of the number of items, and it attempts to maximize the value each agent receives.

Finally, the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
