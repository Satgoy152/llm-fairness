Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  29  13  15   8  65  48   2  55
1  39  42  53  94  28  88  41  47  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations in the table, we aim to allocate items to maximize fairness, which typically involves trying to equalize the total value each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would gain for different allocations, aiming for a balanced distribution:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** We'll start by allocating items with the highest value for Agent 0 since they have fewer high-value items compared to Agent 1.

   - High-value items for Agent 0: Item 5 (65), Item 8 (55), Item 6 (48)
   - Allocate these initially: [5, 8, 6]

2. **Agent 1:** Agent 1 has a generally higher valuation for most items, so we can distribute the remaining items while ensuring Agent 0's allocation is not overly disadvantaged.

   - High-value items for Agent 1: Item 3 (94), Item 5 (88), Item 8 (84)
   - Allocate initially to balance: [3, 4, 7, 1, 2]

3. **Balancing Remaining Items:**

   - Agent 0 should also get some lower-value items from Agent 1's list to balance total value.
   - Allocate: Agent 0 gets Item 0 (14), Item 1 (29), and Item 3 (15)
   - Allocate: Agent 1 gets Item 4 (28), Item 7 (47), Item 2 (53)

Note: The actual allocation should try to balance as closely as possible considering integer allocations and the constraint of maximizing each agent's valuation.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [2, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide a fair distribution of total values between the agents while maintaining integer allocations of items.
