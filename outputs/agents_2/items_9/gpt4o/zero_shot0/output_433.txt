Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  73  63   9  30  49  95  69  33
1  88  78  20  16  65  64  42  66  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring a balanced distribution of items. We will use a greedy approach to allocate items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents.

First, let's calculate the difference in valuations for each item and sort the items based on this difference:

- Item 0: Agent 1 has higher valuation (88 vs 59) - Difference: 29
- Item 1: Agent 1 has higher valuation (78 vs 73) - Difference: 5
- Item 2: Agent 0 has higher valuation (63 vs 20) - Difference: 43
- Item 3: Agent 0 has higher valuation (9 vs 16) - Difference: 7
- Item 4: Agent 1 has higher valuation (65 vs 30) - Difference: 35
- Item 5: Agent 1 has higher valuation (64 vs 49) - Difference: 15
- Item 6: Agent 0 has higher valuation (95 vs 42) - Difference: 53
- Item 7: Agent 0 has higher valuation (69 vs 66) - Difference: 3
- Item 8: Agent 0 has higher valuation (33 vs 23) - Difference: 10

Now, let's sort the items based on the absolute value of the differences:

1. Item 6: Difference 53
2. Item 2: Difference 43
3. Item 4: Difference 35
4. Item 0: Difference 29
5. Item 5: Difference 15
6. Item 8: Difference 10
7. Item 3: Difference 7
8. Item 1: Difference 5
9. Item 7: Difference 3

Next, we allocate the items to the agents based on who values them more, ensuring a balanced allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets item 6 (higher valuation: 95)
2. Agent 0 gets item 2 (higher valuation: 63)
3. Agent 1 gets item 4 (higher valuation: 65)
4. Agent 1 gets item 0 (higher valuation: 88)
5. Agent 1 gets item 5 (higher valuation: 64)
6. Agent 0 gets item 8 (higher valuation: 33)
7. Agent 1 gets item 3 (higher valuation: 16)
8. Agent 1 gets item 1 (higher valuation: 78)
9. Agent 0 gets item 7 (higher valuation: 69)

Finally, here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations.
