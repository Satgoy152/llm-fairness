Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  61  10  60   0  54  75  43  79
1  32  60   5   0  27   1  55  94  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [32 60  5  0 27  1 55 94 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets approximately half of the items, since there are two agents and nine items.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [30, 61, 10, 60, 0, 54, 75, 43, 79]
- Agent 1: [32, 60, 5, 0, 27, 1, 55, 94, 42]

We can evaluate each item by the difference in valuation between the two agents and allocate items to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values 30 and Agent 1 values 32. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values 61 and Agent 1 values 60. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values 10 and Agent 1 values 5. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values 60 and Agent 1 values 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values 0 and Agent 1 values 27. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values 54 and Agent 1 values 1. Allocate to Agent 0.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values 75 and Agent 1 values 55. Allocate to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values 43 and Agent 1 values 94. Allocate to Agent 1.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values 79 and Agent 1 values 42. Allocate to Agent 0.

Now let's check the distribution:
- Agent 0 has items: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8]
- Agent 1 has items: [0, 4, 7]

After reviewing, we want to have a more balanced split (4 items each, given the constraint of integer allocation). Let's adjust the allocation:

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
- Agent 1: [0, 4, 6, 7]

This allocation attempts to balance the number of items each agent receives while also considering their valuations. Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
