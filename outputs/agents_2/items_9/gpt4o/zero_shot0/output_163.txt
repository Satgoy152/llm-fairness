Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  80  42   5  22  22   2  95  55
1  74  91  16  53  60  38  83  54  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives. Hereâ€™s one way to achieve a fair allocation:

First, calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

For Agent 0:  
10 + 80 + 42 + 5 + 22 + 22 + 2 + 95 + 55 = 333

For Agent 1:  
74 + 91 + 16 + 53 + 60 + 38 + 83 + 54 + 47 = 516

Next, allocate items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible. We'll try to distribute the items based on maximizing the minimum satisfaction for each agent.

One possible allocation is:

- Agent 0: [0, 6, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

To verify, calculate the total values each agent receives:

Agent 0 receives items:  
10 + 2 + 95 + 55 = 162

Agent 1 receives items:  
80 + 42 + 5 + 22 + 22 = 171

This allocation provides a reasonably balanced distribution of values. The total values are not equal, but they are fairly close given the constraints of the problem.

Thus, the allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
