Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  3  47  83   2  15  62  61  29
1  17  3  94  94  74  80   2  60  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and ensure that each agent ends up with a fair share. One way to achieve this is by maximizing the total valuation for both agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. List all items along with their valuations for both agents. 
2. Sort the items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents.
3. Allocate items to the agents in a way that balances their total valuations.

Let's follow this process:

### Items and Valuations

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 values it at 17.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 3, Agent 1 values it at 3.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 values it at 94.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 83, Agent 1 values it at 94.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 values it at 74.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 values it at 80.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 values it at 2.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 60.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 29, Agent 1 values it at 47.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Items with a higher preference for Agent 0**:
   - Item 0
   - Item 6

2. **Items with a higher preference for Agent 1**:
   - Item 2
   - Item 3
   - Item 4
   - Item 5

3. **Items with similar valuations**:
   - Item 1
   - Item 7
   - Item 8

### Initial Allocation

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 3, 4, 5

### Balance Remaining Items

- Allocate Item 1, 7, and 8 based on remaining needs and balancing total value:

   - **Agent 0**: Item 1, Item 7
   - **Agent 1**: Item 8

### Final Allocation

- **Agent 0**: [0, 1, 6, 7]
- **Agent 1**: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

This results in a balanced allocation given the constraints.

### JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
}
```
