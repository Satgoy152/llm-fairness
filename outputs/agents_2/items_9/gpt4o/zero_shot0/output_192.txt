Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  16  75  56  75  81  70  33  32
1  43  55  64  13  24  33  87   2  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's start by evaluating the total valuation for each item by each agent and then distribute the items to maximize the satisfaction or valuation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 has higher valuations for items: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
   - Agent 1 has higher valuations for items: 1, 6.

2. **Assign Items Based on Valuation:**
   - Assign items where one agent has a significantly higher valuation compared to the other.
   - Balance the total number of items between the agents.

3. **Fair Distribution:**
   - Assign items to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring an integer number of items for each agent.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 1, 6, 8

### JSON Representation:

```
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, with an attempt to balance the number of items each agent receives.
