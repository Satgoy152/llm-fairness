Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  10  47  18   7  76  52  55  11
1   5  90  20  32  97  71  10  77  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[62 10 47 18  7 76 52 55 11]
 [ 5 90 20 32 97 71 10 77 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items such that their total valuation is as balanced as possible. We can use a greedy approach to allocate items based on the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [62, 10, 47, 18, 7, 76, 52, 55, 11]
- Agent 1's valuations: [5, 90, 20, 32, 97, 71, 10, 77, 90]

We'll calculate the difference between the agents' valuations for each item and allocate the items to the agent with the higher valuation.

1. Item 0: Agent 0 (62) vs Agent 1 (5) - Allocate to Agent 0
2. Item 1: Agent 0 (10) vs Agent 1 (90) - Allocate to Agent 1
3. Item 2: Agent 0 (47) vs Agent 1 (20) - Allocate to Agent 0
4. Item 3: Agent 0 (18) vs Agent 1 (32) - Allocate to Agent 1
5. Item 4: Agent 0 (7) vs Agent 1 (97) - Allocate to Agent 1
6. Item 5: Agent 0 (76) vs Agent 1 (71) - Allocate to Agent 0
7. Item 6: Agent 0 (52) vs Agent 1 (10) - Allocate to Agent 0
8. Item 7: Agent 0 (55) vs Agent 1 (77) - Allocate to Agent 1
9. Item 8: Agent 0 (11) vs Agent 1 (90) - Allocate to Agent 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the distribution attempts to be as fair as possible given the valuations.
