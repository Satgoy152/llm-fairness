Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  37  21  86  69  35  79  93  15
1  79  24   7   2   2  95  18   8  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to try to balance the total value each agent receives. Let's calculate the total value each agent would get for different allocation scenarios and find a reasonable balance.

First, calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 64 + 37 + 21 + 86 + 69 + 35 + 79 + 93 + 15 = 499
- Agent 1: 79 + 24 + 7 + 2 + 2 + 95 + 18 + 8 + 25 = 260

Since there are 9 items, one agent will receive 4 items and the other will receive 5 items. We will try to allocate items so that the total valuation each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's attempt an allocation:

1. Allocate items with high values to each agent while trying to balance the totals.

   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 95), as it is a high-value item for them.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value 93), as it is a high-value item for them.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 86), as it is a high-value item for them.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 64), as it is a high-value item for them.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 37), as it balances the value distribution.

At this point, Agent 0 has items 0, 1, 3, 7, and their combined value is 64 + 37 + 86 + 93 = 280.

2. Allocate the remaining items to Agent 1:

   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 2).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 7).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 18).
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (value 25).

Now, Agent 1 has items 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and their combined value is 7 + 2 + 95 + 18 + 25 = 147.

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 280 and Agent 1 a total value of 147. This is reasonably balanced given the initial total valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
