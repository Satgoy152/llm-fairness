Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2  3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  79  64  3  38  25  76  91  23
1  72  67  10  6  58  76  39  15  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives a comparable total value. One approach is to use a method like envy-free or maximizing total valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 33 + 79 + 64 + 3 + 38 + 25 + 76 + 91 + 23 = 432
- Agent 1's total valuation: 72 + 67 + 10 + 6 + 58 + 76 + 39 + 15 + 11 = 354

Since each agent should get an integer number of items, and there are 9 items in total, each agent will receive approximately half of the items. We'll allocate based on maximizing each agent's value but trying to keep the total value roughly equal.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent until they have a similar total value.
2. Adjust the allocation if necessary to ensure it is envy-free.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 most values items: 7, 1, 6, 2, 0, 4, 5, 8, 3
- Agent 1 most values items: 0, 5, 4, 1, 6, 2, 7, 8, 3

Allocate based on highest values while ensuring fairness:

**Allocation:**

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 6, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: [1, 3, 4, 5]

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair distribution based on their highest valuations, while each receives an integer number of items.
