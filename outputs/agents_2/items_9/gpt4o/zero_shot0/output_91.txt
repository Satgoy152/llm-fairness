Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  53  95  93   2  69  57  36   3
1  44  73  98  97  61  92  97  51  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Considering there are two agents and nine items, we aim for a balanced allocation of four or five items per agent.

Let's evaluate the optimal allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**  
   - Item 0: 83
   - Item 1: 53
   - Item 2: 95
   - Item 3: 93
   - Item 4: 2
   - Item 5: 69
   - Item 6: 57
   - Item 7: 36
   - Item 8: 3

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**  
   - Item 0: 44
   - Item 1: 73
   - Item 2: 98
   - Item 3: 97
   - Item 4: 61
   - Item 5: 92
   - Item 6: 97
   - Item 7: 51
   - Item 8: 70

**Allocation Strategy:**  
- We aim to allocate items such that each agent maximizes their total value while maintaining fairness in the number of items.

**Allocation Decision:**  
- Agent 0 receives items with higher valuations than Agent 1, and vice versa.  
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 3, 5] (Valuations: 83, 95, 93, 69)  
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4, 6, 7, 8] (Valuations: 73, 61, 97, 51, 70)

Thus, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
