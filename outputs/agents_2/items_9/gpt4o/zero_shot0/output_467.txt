Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  90  90  28  67  95  59  86  55
1  26  28  61   7  96   4  79  66  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use an approach that considers maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that is as fair as possible based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent and distribute the items accordingly:

Agent 0's total valuations for each item:
- Item 0: 39
- Item 1: 90
- Item 2: 90
- Item 3: 28
- Item 4: 67
- Item 5: 95
- Item 6: 59
- Item 7: 86
- Item 8: 55

Agent 1's total valuations for each item:
- Item 0: 26
- Item 1: 28
- Item 2: 61
- Item 3: 7
- Item 4: 96
- Item 5: 4
- Item 6: 79
- Item 7: 66
- Item 8: 75

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a greedy approach to allocate items one by one to the agent who values it more, while maintaining a balance in the total number of items each agent receives.

After evaluating the allocations, we can distribute the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 8]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1, 2, 5, 7].
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 4, 6, 8].

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
