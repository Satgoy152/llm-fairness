Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  38   8  63  64  49  27  59  65
1  62  33  37  16  46  39  77  95  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuation table, we aim to distribute the items such that both agents get a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's consider both agents and their valuations for each item:

Agent 0:  
- Item 0: 37  
- Item 1: 38  
- Item 2: 8  
- Item 3: 63  
- Item 4: 64  
- Item 5: 49  
- Item 6: 27  
- Item 7: 59  
- Item 8: 65  

Agent 1:  
- Item 0: 62  
- Item 1: 33  
- Item 2: 37  
- Item 3: 16  
- Item 4: 46  
- Item 5: 39  
- Item 6: 77  
- Item 7: 95  
- Item 8: 40  

Now, let's allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the higher valuation.

Allocations based on valuations:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 1 (62 > 37)
- Item 1: Assign to Agent 0 (38 > 33)
- Item 2: Assign to Agent 1 (37 > 8)
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 0 (63 > 16)
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 0 (64 > 46)
- Item 5: Assign to Agent 0 (49 > 39)
- Item 6: Assign to Agent 1 (77 > 27)
- Item 7: Assign to Agent 1 (95 > 59)
- Item 8: Assign to Agent 0 (65 > 40)

Final allocations for each agent:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 6, 7]
}
```

Note that this distribution attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their respective valuations.
