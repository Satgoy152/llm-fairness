Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73   1  84  33  15  32  60  40  41
1  90  94   1  17  98  40  96  51  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the satisfaction of both agents by considering their valuations. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while also ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Given the valuations, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.
3. Adjust if necessary to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (90 vs. 73).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (94 vs. 1).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (84 vs. 1).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (33 vs. 17).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (98 vs. 15).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (40 vs. 32).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (96 vs. 60).
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (51 vs. 40).
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it more (92 vs. 41).

Now let's count the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

Agent 0 has 2 items, and Agent 1 has 7 items. To balance this, we can reallocate one item from Agent 1 to Agent 0, based on the smallest difference in valuations:

- Item 7: Agent 0 values it 40, and Agent 1 values it 51 (smallest difference among items with Agent 1).

Reallocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8]

Now, both agents have 3 and 6 items, respectively, but we need to make it 4 each. Let's attempt another balance:

Since there are 9 items, a perfect integer split isn't possible, so let's aim for a close distribution:

- Move Item 6 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0: 60, Agent 1: 96).

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 4, 5, 8]

Now, the allocation is more balanced in terms of both item count and valuation.

Here is the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5, 8]
}
```
