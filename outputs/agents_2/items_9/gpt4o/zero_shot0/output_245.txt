Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  75  12  43  72   3  98   0  72
1  83  64  29  79  71  72  63  17  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to distribute the items in a way that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent.

Let's look at the valuations and consider the best way to distribute the items:

Agent 0's total valuation: 
- 0: 52
- 1: 75
- 2: 12
- 3: 43
- 4: 72
- 5: 3
- 6: 98
- 7: 0
- 8: 72

Agent 1's total valuation:
- 0: 83
- 1: 64
- 2: 29
- 3: 79
- 4: 71
- 5: 72
- 6: 63
- 7: 17
- 8: 39

We can allocate the items one by one to the agent who values it more, balancing the total value:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (83 vs. 52)
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (75 vs. 64)
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (29 vs. 12)
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (79 vs. 43)
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (72 vs. 71)
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (72 vs. 3)
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (98 vs. 63)
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (17 vs. 0)
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (72 vs. 39)

The allocation would then be:

- Agent 0: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Agent 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
