Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  57  24  51  53  12  28  18  73
1  43  42  90  84  88  82  51  61  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items such that the total value of their allocated items is as balanced as possible. Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Using a greedy approach, allocate items to the agent that values them more, while keeping track of the total value allocated to each agent.
3. Adjust the allocations if necessary to balance the total values more evenly.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 8 + 57 + 24 + 51 + 53 + 12 + 28 + 18 + 73 = 324
- Agent 1's total value: 43 + 42 + 90 + 84 + 88 + 82 + 51 + 61 + 40 = 581

We will allocate items by comparing the values each agent assigns to each item and then make the allocation so that both agents have a balanced total value:

1. Compare the values for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (8) vs. Agent 1 (43) → Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (57) vs. Agent 1 (42) → Allocate to Agent 0
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (24) vs. Agent 1 (90) → Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (51) vs. Agent 1 (84) → Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (53) vs. Agent 1 (88) → Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (12) vs. Agent 1 (82) → Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (28) vs. Agent 1 (51) → Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (18) vs. Agent 1 (61) → Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 8: Agent 0 (73) vs. Agent 1 (40) → Allocate to Agent 0

Now we check the total values:

- Agent 0: 57 (Item 1) + 73 (Item 8) = 130
- Agent 1: 43 (Item 0) + 90 (Item 2) + 84 (Item 3) + 88 (Item 4) + 82 (Item 5) + 51 (Item 6) + 61 (Item 7) = 451

This allocation is highly skewed, so let's try to adjust for a more balanced distribution:

Reassign Item 1 to Agent 1, increasing Agent 1's total and reducing Agent 0's:

- Agent 0: 73 (Item 8) = 73
- Agent 1: 43 (Item 0) + 57 (Item 1) + 90 (Item 2) + 84 (Item 3) + 88 (Item 4) + 82 (Item 5) + 51 (Item 6) + 61 (Item 7) = 551

Now, reassign Item 3 to Agent 0:

- Agent 0: 73 (Item 8) + 51 (Item 3) = 124
- Agent 1: 43 (Item 0) + 57 (Item 1) + 90 (Item 2) + 88 (Item 4) + 82 (Item 5) + 51 (Item 6) + 61 (Item 7) = 500

Reassign Item 4 to Agent 0:

- Agent 0: 73 (Item 8) + 51 (Item 3) + 53 (Item 4) = 177
- Agent 1: 43 (Item 0) + 57 (Item 1) + 90 (Item 2) + 82 (Item 5) + 51 (Item 6) + 61 (Item 7) = 447

The allocation is now more balanced. Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
