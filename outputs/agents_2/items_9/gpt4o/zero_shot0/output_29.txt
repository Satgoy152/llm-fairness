Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  52  84  64  68  16  48  95  96
1  51  45  75  80  88  68  13  24  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should try to balance the total value of the items each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's work through the allocation:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations for Each Agent
First, we calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- **Agent 0**: 27 + 52 + 84 + 64 + 68 + 16 + 48 + 95 + 96 = 550
- **Agent 1**: 51 + 45 + 75 + 80 + 88 + 68 + 13 + 24 + 38 = 482

### Step 2: Determine Fair Allocation
Since Agent 0 has a higher total valuation across all items, they should receive slightly fewer high-value items to balance the allocation. We'll aim to make the total value of items received by each agent as close as possible.

### Step 3: Allocate Items
- **Agent 0** prefers items 8, 7, and 2 most. Let's allocate these items first.
- **Agent 1** prefers items 4, 3, and 2 most (but item 2 is already preferred by Agent 0), so we'll allocate items 4 and 3 to Agent 1.

Continue this process to balance the allocations:

1. Allocate items with the highest preferences:
   - Agent 0: [8, 7, 2]
   - Agent 1: [4, 3]

2. Proceed to allocate remaining items:
   - Agent 0: [8, 7, 2, 1, 6]
   - Agent 1: [4, 3, 0, 5]

3. Allocate leftover item:
   - Agent 1: [4, 3, 0, 5, 1]

### Step 4: Final Allocation
After revisiting the items and valuations, we aim to balance the sum of values each agent receives:

- **Agent 0**: [8, 7, 2, 6]
  - Total Valuation for Agent 0: 96 + 95 + 84 + 48 = 323
- **Agent 1**: [4, 3, 0, 5, 1]
  - Total Valuation for Agent 1: 88 + 80 + 51 + 68 + 45 = 332

This allocation provides a reasonably balanced distribution based on the total valuations.

### Final Allocations in JSON format
```json
{
    "0": [8, 7, 2, 6],
    "1": [4, 3, 0, 5, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives as closely as possible.
