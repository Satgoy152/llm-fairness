Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6   7   8
0  79  57  70  17  30  41  2  23  39
1  31  34  23   1  55  16  6  74  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method such as maximizing the total valuation each agent gets, ensuring that both agents receive a balanced allocation based on their preferences.

Here's how the allocation can be approached:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they receive all items.
2. Attempt to allocate items such that the difference between the total valuation of both agents is minimized.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation for each agent if they receive all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 79 + 57 + 70 + 17 + 30 + 41 + 2 + 23 + 39 = 358
- Agent 1's total valuation: 31 + 34 + 23 + 1 + 55 + 16 + 6 + 74 + 71 = 311

Now, let's fairly allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (79 > 31)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (57 > 34)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (70 > 23)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (17 > 1)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (55 > 30)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (41 > 16)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (6 > 2)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (74 > 23)
- Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (71 > 39)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value received by each agent while ensuring each item is assigned to the agent who values it more.
