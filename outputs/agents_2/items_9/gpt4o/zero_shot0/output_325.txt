Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  71  83  75  46  87  32  15  90
1  62  58   1  21  46  31   8  32  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to balance the total value each agent receives. Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items, and then try to distribute the items such that the total value is as evenly distributed as possible.

First, we calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 54 + 71 + 83 + 75 + 46 + 87 + 32 + 15 + 90 = 553
- Agent 1: 62 + 58 + 1 + 21 + 46 + 31 + 8 + 32 + 62 = 321

Next, we'll attempt to allocate the items to balance the total values:

1. Start by giving the highest value items to both agents, alternating to balance the total values.
2. Adjust as needed to ensure each agent gets a fair total value.

Let's try to allocate items step by step:

- Give agent 0 item 8 (value 90), agent 1 item 0 (value 62).
- Agent 0 takes item 5 (value 87), agent 1 takes item 1 (value 58).
- Agent 0 takes item 2 (value 83), agent 1 takes item 3 (value 21).
- Agent 0 takes item 3 (value 75), agent 1 takes item 4 (value 46).
- Agent 0 takes item 1 (value 71), agent 1 takes item 7 (value 32).
- Agent 0 takes item 4 (value 46), agent 1 takes item 5 (value 31).
- Agent 0 takes item 7 (value 15), agent 1 takes item 6 (value 8).

Now, let's check the total values:

- Agent 0: 90 + 87 + 83 + 75 + 71 + 46 + 15 = 467
- Agent 1: 62 + 58 + 21 + 46 + 32 + 31 + 8 = 258

The total values are not perfectly balanced yet, but each agent has an integer number of items. Let's try a better configuration:

- Give agent 0 items: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7
- Give agent 1 items: 3, 4, 6, 8

Calculating the total values again:

- Agent 0: 54 + 71 + 83 + 87 + 15 = 310
- Agent 1: 75 + 46 + 8 + 90 = 219

This allocation is more balanced, but we can try to optimize further. Here's a final attempt:

- Allocate items: 
  - Agent 0: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8
  - Agent 1: 1, 3, 4, 7

Calculating the total values again:

- Agent 0: 54 + 83 + 87 + 32 + 90 = 346
- Agent 1: 71 + 75 + 46 + 15 = 207

This solution provides a better balance based on the values provided. Let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
