Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  95  39  34  36  37  76  50  32
1  30  82  79  14  50  26  15  91   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the "envy-free" method, which ensures that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they would value the other agent's allocation. We'll proceed by considering the valuations and trying to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's one possible allocation that aims to be fair:

1. Assign items to maximize each agent's total valuation, considering their preferences.

Let's calculate:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Total valuation if they receive items: 85 + 95 + 39 + 34 + 36 + 37 + 76 + 50 + 32 = 484

- Agent 1 values:
  - Total valuation if they receive items: 30 + 82 + 79 + 14 + 50 + 26 + 15 + 91 + 2 = 389

To balance the allocation, we can give some of the higher-valued items for Agent 0 to Agent 1 to increase Agent 1's total valuation.

A fair allocation can be as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 7

Now let's check the total valuations:

- Agent 0 values their allocation: 85 + 39 + 36 + 37 + 76 + 32 = 305
- Agent 1 values their allocation: 95 + 14 + 91 = 200

This distribution isn't balanced. Let's try another distribution:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 7, 8

Now calculate again:

- Agent 0 values their allocation: 85 + 34 + 36 + 37 + 76 = 268
- Agent 1 values their allocation: 95 + 79 + 91 + 2 = 267

This seems more balanced. Let's put it in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation is fairly balanced, with each agent receiving a similar total valuation.
