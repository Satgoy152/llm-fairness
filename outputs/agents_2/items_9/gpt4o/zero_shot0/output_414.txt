Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  99   4  89  56  39  93  89  76
1  41  52  27  97  84  58  10  19   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 52 27 97 84 58 10 19  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that the allocations are balanced. A common approach is to use an algorithm that considers each agent's relative valuations of the items.

Let's consider the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [58, 99, 4, 89, 56, 39, 93, 89, 76]
Agent 1: [41, 52, 27, 97, 84, 58, 10, 19, 9]
```

We can allocate items by determining which agent values each item more, trying to balance the total number of items each agent receives.

1. Compare the valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values more (58 vs. 41)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values more (99 vs. 52)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values more (4 vs. 27)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values more (89 vs. 97)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values more (56 vs. 84)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values more (39 vs. 58)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values more (93 vs. 10)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values more (89 vs. 19)
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values more (76 vs. 9)

2. Allocate the items:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 4, 5

3. Check the number of items allocated to each agent:
   - Agent 0: 5 items
   - Agent 1: 4 items

Since the allocations are fairly balanced in terms of the number of items, here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This approach prioritizes giving each agent the items they value more while trying to balance the number of items between the agents.
