Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  57   2  51  18  19  89   8  14
1  16  48  42  23  97   5  17  10  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that both agents receive a set of items that is as close as possible in total value according to their individual valuations. This can be achieved by analyzing the valuations and distributing the items to balance the total value for each agent.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would have if they received all the items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 56 + 57 + 2 + 51 + 18 + 19 + 89 + 8 + 14 = 314
- Total value for Agent 1: 16 + 48 + 42 + 23 + 97 + 5 + 17 + 10 + 72 = 330

Since each agent should get an integer number of items, we aim for a balanced allocation of the total values. Here's a possible allocation that achieves this goal:

1. Allocate items to Agent 0:
   - Items 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
   - Total value for Agent 0: 56 + 57 + 51 + 19 + 89 + 14 = 286

2. Allocate items to Agent 1:
   - Items 2, 4, 7
   - Total value for Agent 1: 42 + 97 + 10 = 149

This allocation might not perfectly balance the total values, so adjustments can be made. Let's try to improve it:

- Reallocate item 6 from Agent 0 to Agent 1:
  - New total value for Agent 0: 56 + 57 + 51 + 19 + 14 = 197
  - New total value for Agent 1: 42 + 97 + 10 + 89 = 238

This allocation still doesn't balance well, so let's try another approach by swapping some items:

- Allocate items to Agent 0:
  - Items 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
  - Total value for Agent 0: 56 + 57 + 19 + 8 + 14 = 154

- Allocate items to Agent 1:
  - Items 2, 3, 4, 6
  - Total value for Agent 1: 42 + 23 + 97 + 17 = 179

This allocation provides a closer balance in terms of the total value perceived by each agent. Let's finalize this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items such that each agent's total perceived value is relatively balanced. Adjustments can be made further if necessary, but this allocation provides a fair starting point based on the given valuations.
