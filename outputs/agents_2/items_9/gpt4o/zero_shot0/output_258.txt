Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  64  22  82   1   2  21  39  73
1  73   8  99  45  57  67   4  76  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of items. We'll aim for each agent to get roughly half of the items, which in this case means 4 or 5 items each.

Let's allocate the items using a greedy approach by considering the value each agent assigns to the items and ensuring they have a similar total value:

1. **Agent 0's Allocation**:
   - Item 3 (Value: 82)
   - Item 0 (Value: 75)
   - Item 8 (Value: 73)
   - Item 1 (Value: 64)
   - Item 7 (Value: 39)

2. **Agent 1's Allocation**:
   - Item 2 (Value: 99)
   - Item 5 (Value: 67)
   - Item 6 (Value: 4)
   - Item 4 (Value: 57)

This distribution ensures that each agent has a reasonable total value from their allocation. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 8, 1, 7],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 4]
}
```
