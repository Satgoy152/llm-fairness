Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  67  32  78  77  75  42  55  13
1   7  32  34  24  49  63  42  14  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider both the valuations and the total value each agent perceives from the items. The goal is to make sure that each agent receives an allocation that is as fair as possible, potentially balancing the total perceived value and/or the number of items.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 47 + 67 + 32 + 78 + 77 + 75 + 42 + 55 + 13 = 486
- Agent 1: 7 + 32 + 34 + 24 + 49 + 63 + 42 + 14 + 39 = 304

Next, we can try to allocate the items in a way that balances the total value perceived by each agent. Given that agent 0 has a much higher total valuation, we should aim to give agent 1 items that they value more, to balance the perceived fairness.

We'll aim to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as close to half of the total valuation as possible for fairness:

1. Sort items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents, prioritizing items that agent 1 values more compared to agent 0.

2. Allocate items iteratively, checking the current total value each agent has, and aiming to keep them balanced.

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

- Items allocated to agent 0: [0, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- Items allocated to agent 1: [1, 2, 7, 8]

To verify:

- Agent 0 values: 47 (item 0) + 78 (item 3) + 77 (item 4) + 75 (item 5) + 42 (item 6) = 319
- Agent 1 values: 67 (item 1) + 32 (item 2) + 14 (item 7) + 39 (item 8) = 152

This allocation makes the total perceived value closer to balanced given the constraints.

Now, presenting the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 7, 8]
}
```
