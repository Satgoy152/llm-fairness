Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29   5  96  85  98  91  39  60   3
1  94  65  64  23  58  40  82  83  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to distribute them such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Analysis**: We have two agents (0 and 1) and nine items (0 to 8) with their respective valuations.

2. **Greedy Allocation Strategy**: Allocate the items one by one to the agent who values them more until all items are allocated.

3. **Balancing Total Valuations**: Adjust the allocation if necessary to ensure a fairly balanced distribution in terms of total valuation.

Let's execute the allocation:

- Initially, assign each item to the agent who values it more:
  - Item 0: Agent 1 (94 vs 29)
  - Item 1: Agent 1 (65 vs 5)
  - Item 2: Agent 0 (96 vs 64)
  - Item 3: Agent 0 (85 vs 23)
  - Item 4: Agent 0 (98 vs 58)
  - Item 5: Agent 0 (91 vs 40)
  - Item 6: Agent 1 (82 vs 39)
  - Item 7: Agent 1 (83 vs 60)
  - Item 8: Agent 1 (75 vs 3)

- Initial Allocation:
  - Agent 0: [2, 3, 4, 5]
  - Agent 1: [0, 1, 6, 7, 8]

- Calculate total valuations for each:
  - Agent 0: 96 + 85 + 98 + 91 = 370
  - Agent 1: 94 + 65 + 82 + 83 + 75 = 399

- The distribution is fairly balanced in terms of total valuation as Agent 1 slightly has more, which is acceptable in a fair allocation scenario given the close total values.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
