Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  93  17  15  83  45  39  39  27
1   1  73  87  51  37  81  25  28  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring an equitable distribution of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that considers each item's valuation for both agents and assigns it to the agent who values it more, while keeping track of the total number of items each agent gets to ensure it's balanced.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuation.
3. Assign each item to the agent who values it more, while ensuring each agent gets roughly half of the items.

Given the valuations:
```
Agent 0: 71, 93, 17, 15, 83, 45, 39, 39, 27
Agent 1:  1, 73, 87, 51, 37, 81, 25, 28, 79
```

Let's calculate the difference for each item:

1. Item 0: 71 - 1 = 70
2. Item 1: 93 - 73 = 20
3. Item 2: 17 - 87 = -70
4. Item 3: 15 - 51 = -36
5. Item 4: 83 - 37 = 46
6. Item 5: 45 - 81 = -36
7. Item 6: 39 - 25 = 14
8. Item 7: 39 - 28 = 11
9. Item 8: 27 - 79 = -52

Sort by absolute difference:
1. Item 0: 70
2. Item 2: 70
3. Item 8: 52
4. Item 4: 46
5. Item 3: 36
6. Item 5: 36
7. Item 1: 20
8. Item 6: 14
9. Item 7: 11

Assign items based on which agent values them more:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 4, 6, 7
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 5, 8

This allocation results in each agent receiving four items, which is as balanced as possible given the constraints.

Here is the JSON formatted allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and attempts to fairly distribute value based on their preferences.
