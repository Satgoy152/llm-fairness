Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  86  83  98  90  42  27  65  27
1  98  73  87  19  60  61  52  84  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach for such problems is to use a greedy allocation strategy based on valuations, but since we want to ensure fairness, let's proceed with a balanced allocation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0 total valuation: 20 + 86 + 83 + 98 + 90 + 42 + 27 + 65 + 27 = 538
   - Agent 1 total valuation: 98 + 73 + 87 + 19 + 60 + 61 + 52 + 84 + 49 = 583

2. Sort items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents (i.e., absolute value of the difference between agent 0's and agent 1's valuation for each item).

3. Allocate items starting from the largest valuation difference, giving the item to the agent who values it more, while keeping track of the number of items each agent receives to ensure fairness.

Let's go ahead and allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (98 vs. 20) -> Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (86 vs. 73) -> Allocate to Agent 0
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (87 vs. 83) -> Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (98 vs. 19) -> Allocate to Agent 0
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (90 vs. 60) -> Allocate to Agent 0
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (61 vs. 42) -> Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (52 vs. 27) -> Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (84 vs. 65) -> Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (27 vs. 49) -> Allocate to Agent 1

Checking fairness, Agent 0 receives 3 items and Agent 1 receives 6 items. To ensure fairness, let's reassess the allocation:

- Reallocate item 1 (Agent 0's value: 86, Agent 1's value: 73) to Agent 1 to balance the number of items.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 3, 4, and 8, while Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7. This allocation attempts to balance the number of items fairly while considering the valuations.
