Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3  48  77  37  78  91  22  79  33
1  34  65  17  83  30  46  55  71  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to distribute the total value of the items as evenly as possible. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share based on their valuations. Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and then try to distribute the items such that the total value is as close to equal as possible for both agents.

Here are the total valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0: 3 + 48 + 77 + 37 + 78 + 91 + 22 + 79 + 33 = 468
- Agent 1: 34 + 65 + 17 + 83 + 30 + 46 + 55 + 71 + 67 = 468

Both agents value the items at a total of 468, so theoretically, we can aim to split the items such that each agent receives items totaling close to 234 in value.

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Calculate the difference in value each item has for both agents and start assigning items based on where the difference is largest, ensuring both agents have a fair total value.

2. Start with items where one agent has a significantly higher valuation than the other.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Items: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
  - Total Value: 3 + 77 + 78 + 91 + 79 = 328

- Agent 1:
  - Items: 1, 3, 6, 8
  - Total Value: 65 + 83 + 55 + 67 = 270

Now, let's adjust to ensure a closer balance:

Reassign Agent 0's item 7 to Agent 1:

- Agent 0:
  - Items: 0, 2, 4, 5
  - Total Value: 3 + 77 + 78 + 91 = 249

- Agent 1:
  - Items: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
  - Total Value: 65 + 83 + 55 + 71 + 67 = 219

Reassign Agent 0's item 4 to Agent 1:

- Agent 0:
  - Items: 0, 2, 5
  - Total Value: 3 + 77 + 91 = 171

- Agent 1:
  - Items: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
  - Total Value: 65 + 83 + 30 + 55 + 71 + 67 = 371

Reassign Agent 1's item 1 to Agent 0:

- Agent 0:
  - Items: 0, 1, 2, 5
  - Total Value: 3 + 48 + 77 + 91 = 219

- Agent 1:
  - Items: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
  - Total Value: 83 + 30 + 55 + 71 + 67 = 249

This gives us a closer fair allocation based on the initial valuations. Here's the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the total valuation is fairly balanced between the two agents.
