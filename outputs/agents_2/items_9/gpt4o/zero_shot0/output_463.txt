Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  65   1  97  24  73  51  16   4
1  35  55  38  52   1   9  88  35  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a possible strategy to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Try to divide the items such that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(98 + 65 + 1 + 97 + 24 + 73 + 51 + 16 + 4 = 429\)
- Agent 1: \(35 + 55 + 38 + 52 + 1 + 9 + 88 + 35 + 46 = 359\)

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items by considering each agent's highest-valued items first:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (98).
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the most (88).
3. Next, allocate the second-highest valued item for each agent, ensuring it doesn't conflict with the other's highest choice, and so forth.

Using this method, here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 4, 6, 8]

This allocation considers the highest values for each agent without overlap, and each agent ends up with 4 and 5 items respectively, which is a fair distribution given their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6, 8]
}
```
