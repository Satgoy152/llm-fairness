Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  36  85  11  89  61  99  15  68
1  77  76  98  91  54   1  39   9  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value perceived by each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the table:

For Agent 0:
- Total value of all items: 18 + 36 + 85 + 11 + 89 + 61 + 99 + 15 + 68 = 482

For Agent 1:
- Total value of all items: 77 + 76 + 98 + 91 + 54 + 1 + 39 + 9 + 67 = 512

The goal is to allocate the items such that the perceived values are as balanced as possible for both agents.

Let's try an allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to Agent 0 that are more valuable to them than to Agent 1, and vice versa.
2. Try to balance the total value perceived by each agent.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
  - Total value for Agent 0: 18 + 89 + 61 + 99 + 15 = 282

- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3, 8
  - Total value for Agent 1: 76 + 98 + 91 + 67 = 332

This allocation balances the perceived values reasonably well between the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 8]
}
```
