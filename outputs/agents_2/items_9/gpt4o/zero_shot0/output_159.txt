Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3  4   5   6   7   8
0  45  86  38  83  0  11  77  59  90
1  71  50  36  13  7  54  33  36  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We can achieve this by considering the differences in valuations for each item between the two agents and assigning items based on who values them more.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Calculate the Value Difference**: For each item, calculate the difference in valuation between the two agents.

2. **Sort Items by Difference**: Sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuation. This helps prioritize items that one agent values significantly more than the other.

3. **Allocate Items**: Assign items to the agent who values them more until all items are allocated.

Now, let's implement this approach for the given valuations:

1. **Difference Calculation**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (45), Agent 1 (71), Difference = 26
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (86), Agent 1 (50), Difference = 36
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (38), Agent 1 (36), Difference = 2
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (83), Agent 1 (13), Difference = 70
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (0), Agent 1 (7), Difference = 7
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (11), Agent 1 (54), Difference = 43
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (77), Agent 1 (33), Difference = 44
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (59), Agent 1 (36), Difference = 23
   - Item 8: Agent 0 (90), Agent 1 (60), Difference = 30

2. **Sorted by Absolute Difference**:
   - Item 3 (70): Agent 0 (83) vs Agent 1 (13)
   - Item 6 (44): Agent 0 (77) vs Agent 1 (33)
   - Item 5 (43): Agent 0 (11) vs Agent 1 (54)
   - Item 1 (36): Agent 0 (86) vs Agent 1 (50)
   - Item 8 (30): Agent 0 (90) vs Agent 1 (60)
   - Item 0 (26): Agent 0 (45) vs Agent 1 (71)
   - Item 7 (23): Agent 0 (59) vs Agent 1 (36)
   - Item 4 (7): Agent 0 (0) vs Agent 1 (7)
   - Item 2 (2): Agent 0 (38) vs Agent 1 (36)

3. **Allocation**:
   - Assign items based on who values them more:
     - Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8
     - Agent 1: Items 0, 4, 5

4. **Output the Allocation in JSON Format**:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure both agents receive items that they value highly while maintaining a balanced distribution.
