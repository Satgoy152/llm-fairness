Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  76  22  24   2  42  38  41  82
1  62  42  31  44  82  13  26  38  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One common approach is to use an algorithm that attempts to balance the total valuation, such as the maximum envy-free or max-min fair allocation. Given that the agents have different valuations for each item, we can try to balance the distribution by considering the highest value each agent assigns to the items.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Start by sorting items based on the difference in valuation between the two agents. This helps in identifying items that one agent values significantly more than the other.

2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more, and ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

Following this strategy, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 8 the most, so we allocate item 8 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most, so we allocate item 4 to agent 1.
- Allocate the remaining items by comparing valuations and balancing the number of items between agents.

After considering the valuations, here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items and attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.
