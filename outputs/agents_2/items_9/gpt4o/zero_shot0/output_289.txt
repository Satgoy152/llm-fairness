Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  14  22  15  68  87  82  70  94
1  36  38  62   4  71  36  63   8  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring they get an integer number of items. Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to guide our allocation:

Agent 0's total valuation for all items:
- 52 + 14 + 22 + 15 + 68 + 87 + 82 + 70 + 94 = 504

Agent 1's total valuation for all items:
- 36 + 38 + 62 + 4 + 71 + 36 + 63 + 8 + 50 = 368

Next, let's try to allocate the items so that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible, keeping in mind that each agent must receive an integer number of items.

A possible allocation strategy is to assign items giving priority to the highest relative valuation of each agent. Let's allocate:

1. Allocate item 8 to Agent 0, as they value it highly (94).
2. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, which has a relatively high value for them (71).
3. Continue allocating items by selecting the highest remaining valued item for each agent in turn.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

- Agent 0: Items 8, 5, 6, 0
- Agent 1: Items 4, 2, 1, 3, 7

Now, let's verify the total valuation for each agent based on this allocation:

Agent 0's total valuation:
- 94 (item 8) + 87 (item 5) + 82 (item 6) + 52 (item 0) = 315

Agent 1's total valuation:
- 71 (item 4) + 62 (item 2) + 38 (item 1) + 4 (item 3) + 8 (item 7) = 183

This allocation balances the items fairly based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
