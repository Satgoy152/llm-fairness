Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  95  25  92  10  17  15  48  82
1  30  88  16  98  75  42  53  28  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will use a greedy approach to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's evaluate each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 66, and Agent 1 values it at 30. Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 95, and Agent 1 values it at 88. Assign to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 25, and Agent 1 values it at 16. Assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 92, and Agent 1 values it at 98. Assign to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 10, and Agent 1 values it at 75. Assign to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 17, and Agent 1 values it at 42. Assign to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 15, and Agent 1 values it at 53. Assign to Agent 1.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 48, and Agent 1 values it at 28. Assign to Agent 0.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 82, and Agent 1 values it at 88. Assign to Agent 1.

Based on these evaluations, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
