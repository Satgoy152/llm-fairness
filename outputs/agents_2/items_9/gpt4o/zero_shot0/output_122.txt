Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  91  98  48  23  58  29  79  25
1  91  87  19  63  67  16  79  80  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent. One possible strategy is to use a method similar to the envy-free or equitable allocation.

Let's begin by allocating items based on each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 0** Valuations:  
   - Highest to lowest: Item 2 (98), Item 1 (91), Item 7 (79), Item 5 (58), Item 0 (53), Item 3 (48), Item 6 (29), Item 8 (25), Item 4 (23)

2. **Agent 1** Valuations:  
   - Highest to lowest: Item 0 (91), Item 1 (87), Item 7 (80), Item 4 (67), Item 3 (63), Item 8 (47), Item 6 (79), Item 2 (19), Item 5 (16)

We aim to allocate items so that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible, while also ensuring that each agent receives approximately half of the items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 1** highly values Item 0 and Item 1, so let's allocate these to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** highly values Item 2, so let's allocate this to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** highly values Item 7, so let's allocate this to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** highly values Item 5, so let's allocate this to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** highly values Item 4, so let's allocate this to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** highly values Item 3, so let's allocate this to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** highly values Item 8, so let's allocate this to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** highly values Item 6, so let's allocate this to Agent 0.

Now, let's review the allocations and make sure each agent has a fair share:

- **Agent 0**: Items [2, 5, 3, 6]
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 1, 7, 4, 8]

This allocation considers both agents' preferences and ensures a fair distribution of items. The total number of items is 9, which is split approximately equally between the two agents.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 7, 4, 8]
}
```
