Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  40  23  55  39  29  74  90  56
1  18  57  18  87  56  63  92  59   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider a method that balances the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use the "maximum envy-free" allocation or "equal value" method, which tries to balance the overall value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation to ensure that both agents receive as fair a share as possible:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 0
- Item 1: 40
- Item 2: 23
- Item 3: 55
- Item 4: 39
- Item 5: 29
- Item 6: 74
- Item 7: 90
- Item 8: 56

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 18
- Item 1: 57
- Item 2: 18
- Item 3: 87
- Item 4: 56
- Item 5: 63
- Item 6: 92
- Item 7: 59
- Item 8: 7

One possible way to fairly distribute the items is as follows:

1. Assign items that have the highest difference in valuation favoring one agent to that agent.
2. Balance the remaining items to equalize total valuations as much as possible.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 7 (value 90), while Agent 1 only values it at 59. Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 6 (value 92), while Agent 0 values it at 74. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 3 at 55, while Agent 1 values it at 87. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 57, while Agent 0 values it at 40. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 (Agent 0: 29, Agent 1: 63) to Agent 1.
- Assign item 8 (Agent 0: 56, Agent 1: 7) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 (Agent 0: 39, Agent 1: 56) to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 (Agent 0: 23, Agent 1: 18) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 (Agent 0: 0, Agent 1: 18) to Agent 1.

This allocation should be fairly balanced in terms of total perceived value by both agents. Let's verify the total values and present the allocation:

Agent 0 receives items: 2, 7, 8
Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6

Total valuation for Agent 0: 23 (item 2) + 90 (item 7) + 56 (item 8) = 169
Total valuation for Agent 1: 18 (item 0) + 57 (item 1) + 87 (item 3) + 56 (item 4) + 63 (item 5) + 92 (item 6) = 373

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
