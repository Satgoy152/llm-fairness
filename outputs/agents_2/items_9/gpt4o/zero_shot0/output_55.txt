Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  29  58  51  95  38  31  31  54
1  10  61  75  48  40  65  82  61  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. This can be approached by examining the valuations and attempting to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 58
- Item 1: 29
- Item 2: 58
- Item 3: 51
- Item 4: 95
- Item 5: 38
- Item 6: 31
- Item 7: 31
- Item 8: 54

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 10
- Item 1: 61
- Item 2: 75
- Item 3: 48
- Item 4: 40
- Item 5: 65
- Item 6: 82
- Item 7: 61
- Item 8: 57

To achieve a fair allocation, we can start by trying to allocate items where each agent has the highest relative valuation compared to the other. This approach involves comparing the difference in valuations for each item and assigning it to the agent with the higher valuation.

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (58 vs. 10).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (61 vs. 29).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (75 vs. 58).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (51 vs. 48).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (95 vs. 40).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (65 vs. 38).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (82 vs. 31).
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (61 vs. 31).
9. Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (54 vs. 57).

Now, we can present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives based on their preferences.
