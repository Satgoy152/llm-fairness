Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  50  92  65  37  49  91  22  63
1   7  73  10  81  68  53  41  94  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. This is a commonly solved problem using strategies like the "Knapsack Problem" or "Fair Division" algorithms, but due to the simplicity of this example, we can manually optimize the allocation.

Let's evaluate the valuations and try to allocate items to maximize fairness:

- Agent 0 has high values for items: 2, 6, 3
- Agent 1 has high values for items: 7, 3, 1

Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Allocate items based on preference peaks:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 2 and 6 (highest values for agent 0)
   - Agent 1 gets item 7 and 3 (highest values for agent 1)

2. **Allocate remaining items by balancing the overall value:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 0 (high value relative to agent 1)
   - Agent 1 gets item 1 (high value relative to agent 0)
   - Agent 0 gets item 5 (better value for agent 0)
   - Agent 1 gets item 4 (better value for agent 1)
   - Agent 0 gets item 8 (better value for agent 0)

3. **Review to ensure balance in the number of items:**
   - Agent 0 has items: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8
   - Agent 1 has items: 1, 3, 4, 7

This allocation ensures both agents receive items they value highly, and the distribution of items is fair in terms of count.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
