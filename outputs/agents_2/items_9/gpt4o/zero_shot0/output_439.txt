Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  37  39  44  40  73  90  15  97
1  98  37  88  13  25  57  18  32  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that both agents are as satisfied as possible given their respective valuations. This often involves finding a balance where neither agent feels that they are significantly worse off than the other. Let's implement a simple approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Value:** Compute the total value of all items for each agent.
2. **Greedy Allocation:** Assign items one by one to the agent that values it more until all items are assigned, keeping track of the total value each agent receives.
3. **Adjust for Fairness:** If one agent receives significantly more total value than the other, we may adjust the allocation to balance it better.

Let's proceed with this:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Value
- Agent 0 Total Value: \(15 + 37 + 39 + 44 + 40 + 73 + 90 + 15 + 97 = 450\)
- Agent 1 Total Value: \(98 + 37 + 88 + 13 + 25 + 57 + 18 + 32 + 71 = 439\)

### Step 2: Greedy Allocation
- Compare item by item and allocate to the agent who values it more.

1. Item 0: Agent 1 (98) vs Agent 0 (15) → Allocate to Agent 1
2. Item 1: Agent 0 (37) vs Agent 1 (37) → Can choose either, choose Agent 0
3. Item 2: Agent 1 (88) vs Agent 0 (39) → Allocate to Agent 1
4. Item 3: Agent 0 (44) vs Agent 1 (13) → Allocate to Agent 0
5. Item 4: Agent 0 (40) vs Agent 1 (25) → Allocate to Agent 0
6. Item 5: Agent 0 (73) vs Agent 1 (57) → Allocate to Agent 0
7. Item 6: Agent 0 (90) vs Agent 1 (18) → Allocate to Agent 0
8. Item 7: Agent 1 (32) vs Agent 0 (15) → Allocate to Agent 1
9. Item 8: Agent 0 (97) vs Agent 1 (71) → Allocate to Agent 0

### Step 3: Adjust for Fairness
With this allocation, let's calculate the values received by each agent:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8] → Total value = 37 + 44 + 40 + 73 + 90 + 97 = 381
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 7] → Total value = 98 + 88 + 32 = 218

To balance the allocation, let's swap some items if necessary:
- Swap Item 0 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 and Item 8 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

Recalculate the allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0] → Total value = 37 + 44 + 40 + 73 + 90 + 15 = 299
- Agent 1: Items [8, 2, 7] → Total value = 97 + 88 + 32 = 217

This allocation is more balanced. Let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0],
    "1": [8, 2, 7]
}
```
