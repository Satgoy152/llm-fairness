Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  69  90  95  59  48  19  41  56
1  59  68   4  85  86  92  61  23  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to allocate items by comparing the relative values that each agent assigns to each item. We can use a "greedy" strategy where each item is allocated to the agent who values it more, ensuring that both agents get a balanced number of items.

Here's the allocation process:

1. Calculate the absolute difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items based on this difference in descending order.
3. Allocate items to the agent who values the item more, ensuring that each agent gets an equal or nearly equal number of items.

Following these steps, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 59, and Agent 0 values it at 1 (Agent 1 gets it).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 69, and Agent 1 values it at 68 (Agent 0 gets it).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 90, and Agent 1 values it at 4 (Agent 0 gets it).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 95, and Agent 1 values it at 85 (Agent 0 gets it).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 86, and Agent 0 values it at 59 (Agent 1 gets it).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 92, and Agent 0 values it at 48 (Agent 1 gets it).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 61, and Agent 0 values it at 19 (Agent 1 gets it).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 41, and Agent 1 values it at 23 (Agent 0 gets it).
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it at 94, and Agent 0 values it at 56 (Agent 1 gets it).

After ensuring both agents have a fair allocation, here's the result:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 7],
    "1": [0, 4, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total of 4 items and Agent 1 a total of 5 items, which is reasonably fair given the valuations.
