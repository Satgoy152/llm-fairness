Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  50  26  37  59  49  41  15  75
1  56  65  35  15  47  67  38  77  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple approach such as the "round-robin" method. This involves alternating the allocation of items based on which agent values the item more. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Compare the valuations of each item between the two agents.
2. Allocate the item to the agent who values it more.
3. If both agents value an item equally, allocate it to the agent with fewer items currently allocated.

Following this approach, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (56 vs 31), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (65 vs 50), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (35 vs 26), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (37 vs 15), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (59 vs 47), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (67 vs 49), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (41 vs 38), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (77 vs 15), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (75 vs 64), allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value more whenever possible. Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5, 7]
}
```

This way, both agents receive a number of items, with allocations made based on their valuations.
