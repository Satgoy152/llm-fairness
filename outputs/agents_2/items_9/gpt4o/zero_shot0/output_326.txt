Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76   3  42  14  82  38  85  99  62
1  36  85  78   9  50  29  39  10  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach to achieve this is by using a "greedy" method where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the value each agent places on each item and allocate accordingly:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 76, and Agent 1 values it at 36. Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 3, and Agent 1 values it at 85. Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 42, and Agent 1 values it at 78. Assign to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 14, and Agent 1 values it at 9. Assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 82, and Agent 1 values it at 50. Assign to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 38, and Agent 1 values it at 29. Assign to Agent 0.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 85, and Agent 1 values it at 39. Assign to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 99, and Agent 1 values it at 10. Assign to Agent 0.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 62, and Agent 1 values it at 34. Assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, resulting in a fair distribution based on their valuations.
