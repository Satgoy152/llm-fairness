Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  49  55  66  65  22  16  18  71
1  62  62  84  51  97   1  55  11  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to balance the total valuations each agent receives. One common approach is to use a method like the "Greedy" algorithm, where items are allocated based on maximizing the difference in value between the agents. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuation between the two agents, prioritizing items where there is the greatest difference.
3. Allocate items to the agent who values them more until the allocations are reasonably balanced.

Let's calculate the allocations:

1. Total valuation for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 23 + 49 + 55 + 66 + 65 + 22 + 16 + 18 + 71 = 385
   - Agent 1: 62 + 62 + 84 + 51 + 97 + 1 + 55 + 11 + 69 = 492

2. Absolute differences for each item:
   - Item 0: |23 - 62| = 39
   - Item 1: |49 - 62| = 13
   - Item 2: |55 - 84| = 29
   - Item 3: |66 - 51| = 15
   - Item 4: |65 - 97| = 32
   - Item 5: |22 - 1| = 21
   - Item 6: |16 - 55| = 39
   - Item 7: |18 - 11| = 7
   - Item 8: |71 - 69| = 2

3. Sort items by absolute difference:
   - Items sorted by difference: [0, 6, 4, 2, 5, 3, 1, 7, 8]

4. Allocate items based on these differences:
   - Agent 1: 0, 2, 4 (higher value)
   - Agent 0: 1, 3, 5 (higher value)
   - Agent 1: 6 (higher value)
   - Agent 0: 7, 8 (remaining items, more balanced)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations received by each agent as fairly as possible given the constraints.
