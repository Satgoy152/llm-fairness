Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  80  80  54  36  57  71   1  89
1  82  27  66  65  38  14  95  56  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share. One approach to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it more until all items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. Calculate the value each agent assigns to each item.
2. For each item, assign it to the agent who values it more.
3. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 82, Agent 0 values it at 64. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 values it at 27. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Both agents value it equally at 80 and 66 respectively. Assign to Agent 0 (can choose any, but need to balance the total number of items).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 65, Agent 0 values it at 54. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 38, Agent 0 values it at 36. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 values it at 14. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 95, Agent 0 values it at 71. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 56, Agent 0 values it at 1. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 89, Agent 1 values it at 40. Assign to Agent 0.

Ensure that each agent ends up with an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: 1, 2, 5, 8 (4 items)
- Agent 1: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7 (5 items)

Now, we present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
