Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  93  53  25  93  40  35  51  66
1  49  50  21  55  81  65  66  55  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives, considering their individual valuations for each item. Here's one method to achieve a fair allocation:

1. First, calculate the total value each agent would receive if they got all the items. This will help us understand their relative valuations.
2. Then, allocate items one by one to the agent who values them most until each agent receives a similar total value or number of items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Agent 0's total valuation for all items: 493
- Agent 1's total valuation for all items: 458

We'll allocate the items by selecting the highest value for each agent until both have a similar number of items or total valuation.

1. Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (93 vs 50). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (93 vs 81). Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (65 vs 40). Allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (66 vs 35). Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (53 vs 21). Allocate to Agent 0.
6. Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (55 vs 25). Allocate to Agent 1.
7. Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (37 vs 49). Allocate to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (51 vs 55). Allocate to Agent 1.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (66 vs 16). Allocate to Agent 0.

Now let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 4, 2, 0, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 6, 3, 7]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 2, 0, 8],
    "1": [5, 6, 3, 7]
}
```
