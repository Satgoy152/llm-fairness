Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48   0  64  60  13  72  11  42  12
1  72  73  63  14  29  74  95  17  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method like the "maximum sum allocation" or "greedy allocation" approach. This involves assigning items to the agent who values them the most while ensuring both agents get a fair share of items.

Let's go through the items one by one and assign them to the agent who values them more, ensuring that both agents end up with a similar number of items.

Here is the allocation process for each item based on the valuations provided:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 72, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 48. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 73, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 0. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 64, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 63. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 60, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 14. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 29, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 13. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 74, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 72. Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 95, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 11. Assign Item 6 to Agent 1.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 42, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 17. Assign Item 7 to Agent 0.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 12, which is lower than Agent 1's valuation of 36. Assign Item 8 to Agent 1.

Now, let's ensure that the number of items is balanced between the two agents. Currently:

- Agent 0 has items: [2, 3, 7]
- Agent 1 has items: [0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8]

To make the allocation fair, letâ€™s try to swap or adjust allocations so that both agents have a similar number of items.

We can adjust by transferring one item from Agent 1 to Agent 0. Let's transfer Item 4 to Agent 0, who values it at 13, and Agent 1 values it at 29.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 3, 7, 4]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 5, 6, 8]

This results in a fair allocation where Agent 0 and Agent 1 both have 4 and 5 items, respectively.

The final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 7, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
