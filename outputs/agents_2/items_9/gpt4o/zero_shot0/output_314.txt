Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  45  90  81  24  65  33  86   4
1   3  26   7   3   0  44  45  32  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives. One common method for this is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it most, ensuring an integer number of items is allocated to each agent.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. List each item with its respective valuations from both agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuations between the agents, from highest to lowest. This helps prioritize items where one agent has a significantly higher valuation than the other.
3. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more.
4. Ensure each agent receives a fair number of items (in this case, 4 for one agent and 5 for the other).

Let's carry out these steps:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 | Difference |
|------|---------|---------|------------|
| 2    | 90      | 7       | 83         |
| 3    | 81      | 3       | 78         |
| 7    | 86      | 32      | 54         |
| 0    | 14      | 3       | 11         |
| 5    | 65      | 44      | 21         |
| 4    | 24      | 0       | 24         |
| 6    | 33      | 45      | 12         |
| 1    | 45      | 26      | 19         |
| 8    | 4       | 60      | 56         |

Now, allocate each item to the agent with the higher valuation:

- Item 2: Agent 0
- Item 3: Agent 0
- Item 7: Agent 0
- Item 0: Agent 0
- Item 5: Agent 0
- Item 4: Agent 0
- Item 6: Agent 1
- Item 1: Agent 0
- Item 8: Agent 1

Now, we'd like to ensure a more balanced allocation in terms of the number of items. Let's adjust to achieve that:

Agent 0: [2, 3, 7, 0, 5]
Agent 1: [4, 6, 1, 8]

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 7, 0, 5],
    "1": [4, 6, 1, 8]
}
```
