Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  95  51  78   8  32  97  92  15
1  11   8  40  89  44  26  76   0  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed. One way to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most.

Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Allocate the item to the agent with the higher valuation.
3. Repeat this process for all items.

Let's calculate the allocations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 values it at 11. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 values it at 8. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 values it at 40. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 values it at 89. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 values it at 44. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 values it at 26. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 values it at 76. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 values it at 33. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, formatted in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 8]
}
```
