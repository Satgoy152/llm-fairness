Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  84  26  75  76  27  40  65  83
1  46  29  94  62  85  22  45  45  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item by each agent.
2. Assign items in a way that maximizes the valuation for each agent while keeping the total number of items divided as evenly as possible.

Let's break down the allocation process:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [29, 84, 26, 75, 76, 27, 40, 65, 83]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [46, 29, 94, 62, 85, 22, 45, 45, 29]

Now, we want to allocate the items to maximize the satisfaction of each agent while maintaining fairness:

1. Sort items based on the preference difference between the two agents.
2. Distribute items starting from those with the largest difference in preference to ensure each agent receives items they value more.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 94 compared to Agent 0’s 26. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 84 compared to Agent 1’s 29. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 85 compared to Agent 0’s 76. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 75 compared to Agent 1’s 62. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 83 compared to Agent 1’s 29. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 46 compared to Agent 0’s 29. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 65 compared to Agent 1’s 45. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 45 compared to Agent 0’s 40. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 27 compared to Agent 1’s 22. Assign to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 8, 7, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 0, 6]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair allocation based on their valuations. Agent 0 gets five items while Agent 1 gets four items, which is a balanced distribution considering the given valuations.
