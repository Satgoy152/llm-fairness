Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  68   7  91  42  98  56  52  58
1  42   7  41  26  78  91   3  48  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to use a technique like the Knapsack problem or a simple greedy strategy, considering the valuations as weights.

Let's analyze the valuations:

### Agent 0's Valuations:
- Item 0: 18
- Item 1: 68
- Item 2: 7
- Item 3: 91
- Item 4: 42
- Item 5: 98
- Item 6: 56
- Item 7: 52
- Item 8: 58

### Agent 1's Valuations:
- Item 0: 42
- Item 1: 7
- Item 2: 41
- Item 3: 26
- Item 4: 78
- Item 5: 91
- Item 6: 3
- Item 7: 48
- Item 8: 89

We want to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is maximized.

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it at 98, while Agent 1 values it at 91. Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 91, while Agent 1 values it at 26. Assign to Agent 0.
3. **Item 8:** Agent 0 values it at 58, while Agent 1 values it at 89. Assign to Agent 1.
4. **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 42, while Agent 1 values it at 78. Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 68, while Agent 1 values it at 7. Assign to Agent 0.
6. **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it at 52, while Agent 1 values it at 48. Assign to Agent 0.
7. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 18, while Agent 1 values it at 42. Assign to Agent 1.
8. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 7, while Agent 1 values it at 41. Assign to Agent 1.
9. **Item 6:** Agent 0 values it at 56, while Agent 1 values it at 3. Assign to Agent 0.

With this allocation method, we give each agent a fair distribution based on their maximum preference for each item.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and aims to maximize their total valuation.
