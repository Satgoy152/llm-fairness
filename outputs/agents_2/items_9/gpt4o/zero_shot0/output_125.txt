Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7  8
0  21  23  17  29  28  37  89  48  1
1  75  75  85  35  51  19  31  76  9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [75 75 85 35 51 19 31 76  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the preferences or valuations each agent has for the items. We should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 2 agents, one agent will receive 4 items, and the other will receive 5 items.

Here is a step-by-step approach to allocating the items:

1. **List the value each agent places on each item**:
   - Agent 0: [21, 23, 17, 29, 28, 37, 89, 48, 1]
   - Agent 1: [75, 75, 85, 35, 51, 19, 31, 76, 9]

2. **Identify items with high valuations**: Items that have high valuations for one agent and low for the other can be prioritized.

3. **Allocate items by comparing valuations**: 
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 89, and Agent 1 values it at 31. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 85, and Agent 0 values it at 17. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 75, and Agent 0 values it at 21. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 75, and Agent 0 values it at 23. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 76, and Agent 0 values it at 48. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 29, and Agent 1 values it at 35. Allocate to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 needs more items).
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 28, and Agent 1 values it at 51. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 37, and Agent 1 values it at 19. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 1, and Agent 1 values it at 9. Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that Agent 1, who values more items highly, receives 5 items, while Agent 0 receives 4 items. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 7, 3]
}
```
