Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72   5  76  79  72  46  13  11  15
1  89  52  25  42  35  62  27  21  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while attempting to keep the allocations balanced in terms of the number of items each agent receives. Here's one way to do it:

First, let's organize the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [72, 5, 76, 79, 72, 46, 13, 11, 15]
- Agent 1's valuations: [89, 52, 25, 42, 35, 62, 27, 21, 89]

Next, we can try to allocate the items based on a simple approach where each item is given to the agent who values it more, while making sure both agents get roughly an equal number of items. 

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Compare the valuation for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (89) > Agent 0 (72) → Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (52) > Agent 0 (5) → Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (76) > Agent 1 (25) → Allocate to Agent 0
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (79) > Agent 1 (42) → Allocate to Agent 0
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (72) > Agent 1 (35) → Allocate to Agent 0
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (62) > Agent 0 (46) → Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (27) > Agent 0 (13) → Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 7: Agent 1 (21) > Agent 0 (11) → Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 8: Agent 1 (89) > Agent 0 (15) → Allocate to Agent 1

2. Balance the number of items if necessary:
   - Agent 0 currently has 3 items: [2, 3, 4]
   - Agent 1 currently has 6 items: [0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8]

To balance, we might consider swapping one item to ensure a fair distribution by count. For instance, Agent 0 can take one item from Agent 1.

Re-evaluate so that each agent has a balanced count:

- Swap Item 5 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 (as it has a lower difference in valuations between the agents).

Final allocation after balancing:

- Agent 0: [2, 3, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 6, 7, 8]

This allocation provides each agent with four items, balancing the distribution.

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
