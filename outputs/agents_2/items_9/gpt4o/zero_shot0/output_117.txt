Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2   8  54  20  44  82  11  92   5
1  23  32  78  49  20  21  45  60  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [23 32 78 49 20 21 45 60 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items. Given there are 9 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally receive about half of the items, which is 4 or 5 items each.

Let's analyze the valuations for each item and allocate them to balance the total valuations between the two agents:

1. Evaluate each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 values it at 23
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 values it at 32
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 values it at 78
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 values it at 49
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 44, Agent 1 values it at 20
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 82, Agent 1 values it at 21
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 11, Agent 1 values it at 45
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 60
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 values it at 65

2. Allocate items to balance the total valuation:
   - Give Agent 0 the items where they have significantly higher valuation: 5, 4, 7, 2
   - Give Agent 1 the items where they have significantly higher valuation: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8

3. Calculate the total valuation for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Items 5 (82) + 4 (44) + 7 (92) + 2 (54) = 272
   - Agent 1: Items 0 (23) + 1 (32) + 3 (49) + 6 (45) + 8 (65) = 214

This allocation is relatively fair given the constraints, as each agent gets a reasonable share of their highest valued items.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 7, 2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 6, 8]
}
```
