Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  15  67  57  45  56  11  25  44
1  29  11  73  32  36  48  59  35  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that allocates items based on maximizing each agent's relative value for the items, or alternatively, by using a method like the "envy-free" allocation.

Let's use a straightforward allocation strategy to ensure that both agents receive a fair distribution based on their valuations:

1. Compare each item's valuation between the two agents and allocate the item to the agent who values it more.
2. If there is a tie in valuation for a particular item, we can allocate it to the agent with fewer items at that point to help balance the number of items each agent has.
3. After allocation, verify that each agent has a close-to-equal number of items if possible.

Following these steps, let's allocate the items:

```
Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (29 vs. 9), allocate to Agent 1
Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (15 vs. 11), allocate to Agent 0
Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (73 vs. 67), allocate to Agent 1
Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (57 vs. 32), allocate to Agent 0
Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (45 vs. 36), allocate to Agent 0
Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (56 vs. 48), allocate to Agent 0
Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (59 vs. 11), allocate to Agent 1
Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (35 vs. 25), allocate to Agent 1
Item 8: Agent 1 values it more (46 vs. 44), allocate to Agent 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their respective valuations.
