Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87   7  19  26  42  13  77  23  78
1  33  65  66  37   6  67  79  67   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a similar number of items.

Let's start by examining the valuations and then proceed with an allocation strategy. The goal is to assign items such that both agents get items with the highest valuations possible for them.

### Step 1: Compare Valuations
Let's compare the valuations for each item for both agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 87, Agent 1 values at 33 -> Assign to Agent 0
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 7, Agent 1 values at 65 -> Assign to Agent 1
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 19, Agent 1 values at 66 -> Assign to Agent 1
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 26, Agent 1 values at 37 -> Assign to Agent 1
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 42, Agent 1 values at 6 -> Assign to Agent 0
- Item 5: Agent 0 values at 13, Agent 1 values at 67 -> Assign to Agent 1
- Item 6: Agent 0 values at 77, Agent 1 values at 79 -> Assign to Agent 1
- Item 7: Agent 0 values at 23, Agent 1 values at 67 -> Assign to Agent 1
- Item 8: Agent 0 values at 78, Agent 1 values at 9 -> Assign to Agent 0

### Step 2: Allocate Items
Based on the above analysis, we will assign items to each agent:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 8
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7

### Step 3: Present Allocations in JSON Format
Here is the allocation result in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of the items based on their individual valuations.
