Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  28  74  37  69  40  67  88  21
1  75   0  47  93  96  89  38  21  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One common method to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it most. Hereâ€™s how the allocation can be done step-by-step:

1. Compare the valuations of each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.

Let's go through each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 82, Agent 1 at 75. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 at 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 at 47. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 at 93. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 at 96. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 at 89. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 67, Agent 1 at 38. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 at 21. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 at 44. Allocate to Agent 1.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most, resulting in a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
