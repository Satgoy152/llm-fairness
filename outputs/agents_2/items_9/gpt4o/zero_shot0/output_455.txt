Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49   6  34  33  55  66  43  70  22
1   1  82  50  45  97  29  20  37  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[49  6 34 33 55 66 43 70 22]
 [ 1 82 50 45 97 29 20 37 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and attempt to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. A common approach to this problem is to use a greedy algorithm or an optimization method to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items.

Given the valuations table:

```
Agent 0: 49, 6, 34, 33, 55, 66, 43, 70, 22
Agent 1: 1, 82, 50, 45, 97, 29, 20, 37, 82
```

We can allocate the items using a simple method where we assign each item to the agent who values it more, while keeping track of the number of items each agent receives to ensure balance. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Compare valuations of each item for both agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the higher valuation.
3. Adjust if necessary to ensure a balanced number of items.

Let's calculate:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (49) > Agent 1 (1) => Assign to Agent 0
- Item 1: Agent 1 (82) > Agent 0 (6) => Assign to Agent 1
- Item 2: Agent 1 (50) > Agent 0 (34) => Assign to Agent 1
- Item 3: Agent 1 (45) > Agent 0 (33) => Assign to Agent 1
- Item 4: Agent 1 (97) > Agent 0 (55) => Assign to Agent 1
- Item 5: Agent 0 (66) > Agent 1 (29) => Assign to Agent 0
- Item 6: Agent 0 (43) > Agent 1 (20) => Assign to Agent 0
- Item 7: Agent 0 (70) > Agent 1 (37) => Assign to Agent 0
- Item 8: Agent 1 (82) > Agent 0 (22) => Assign to Agent 1

Allocations based on value:

- Agent 0: [0, 5, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8]

This allocation gives each agent a fair number of items (4 and 5 items respectively) and maximizes their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 8]
}
```
