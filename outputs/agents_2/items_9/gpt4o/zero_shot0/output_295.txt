Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  97  26  92   5  63  76  27  18
1  13  28  94  79  71  32  15  32  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Consider each item and determine which agent values the item more.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.
3. Continue until all items are allocated.

Let's apply this process to the given valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 values it at 13. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 values it at 28. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 values it at 94. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 79. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 values it at 71. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 63, Agent 1 values it at 32. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 values it at 15. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 27, Agent 1 values it at 32. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 18, Agent 1 values it at 52. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it more, providing a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
