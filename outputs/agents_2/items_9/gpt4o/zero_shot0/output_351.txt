Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  93   0  91  83  48  13  41  25
1  47  64  96  71  10  85  70  81  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. This can be approached by considering the value each agent assigns to each item and trying to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's review the valuations and try to allocate items to balance the value:

Agent 0:
- 0: 85
- 1: 93
- 2: 0
- 3: 91
- 4: 83
- 5: 48
- 6: 13
- 7: 41
- 8: 25

Agent 1:
- 0: 47
- 1: 64
- 2: 96
- 3: 71
- 4: 10
- 5: 85
- 6: 70
- 7: 81
- 8: 88

First, calculate the total value each agent would get if given all items:
- Total value for Agent 0: 479
- Total value for Agent 1: 612

To balance the allocation, we will assign items in a way that attempts to equalize the total value for both agents.

Let's choose the allocation:

Agent 0:
- Items: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
- Total value: 85 + 93 + 91 + 83 + 13 = 365

Agent 1:
- Items: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Total value: 96 + 85 + 81 + 88 = 350

This allocation does not strictly equalize the values but fairly distributes the items to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
