Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  13  34  11  30  55  20   4  64
1  51  21  61  79  13  50  95  11  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that both get a fair share of the items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent.
2. Use a method to balance the distribution of items and maximize the value for each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

Agent 0 valuations: [82, 13, 34, 11, 30, 55, 20, 4, 64]  
Agent 1 valuations: [51, 21, 61, 79, 13, 50, 95, 11, 53]

To allocate the items fairly, we can use a greedy method to allocate each item to the agent who values it more, then adjust to ensure each agent has an integer number of items.

Initial allocation based on higher valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (82 vs 51)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (13 vs 21)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (34 vs 61)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (11 vs 79)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (30 vs 13)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (55 vs 50)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (20 vs 95)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (4 vs 11)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (64 vs 53)

Now, count the number of items each agent has:
- Agent 0: 6 items [0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: 3 items [2, 3, 6]

To ensure a fair split, we need to adjust the allocation so each agent gets a fair number of items. Let's swap items to balance the allocations:

Swap item 1 with item 3:
- Agent 0: [0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 3]
- Agent 1: [2, 6, 1]

Swap item 7 with item 6:
- Agent 0: [0, 4, 5, 3, 8]
- Agent 1: [2, 6, 1, 7]

Now each agent has 5 and 4 items respectively, and the allocation is more balanced.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 3, 8],
    "1": [2, 6, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize fairness while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
