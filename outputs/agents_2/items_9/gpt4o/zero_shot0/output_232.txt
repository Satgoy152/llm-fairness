Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35   6  62  69  27  25  89  84  76
1  95  22  45  38   5  75  36  67  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, let's consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items based on the difference in valuations between the agents.

First, calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents. Then, allocate each item to the agent who values it more. 

Let's calculate the differences and then allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (95 vs. 35), difference = 60
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (6 vs. 22), difference = -16
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (62 vs. 45), difference = 17
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (69 vs. 38), difference = 31
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (27 vs. 5), difference = 22
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (75 vs. 25), difference = 50
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (89 vs. 36), difference = 53
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (84 vs. 67), difference = 17
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (76 vs. 44), difference = 32

Now, we allocate the items based on these differences:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 5

Finally, let's format the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 5]
}
```
