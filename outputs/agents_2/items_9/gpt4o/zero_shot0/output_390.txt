Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  59  82  49  59  38  13  31  58
1   7  78  40  54  18  41   0  76  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use a method like the "greedy algorithm," where each item is assigned to the agent who values it most, while ensuring that the number of items allocated to each agent remains balanced.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 89, while Agent 1 values it at 7. Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 59, while Agent 1 values it at 78. Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 82, while Agent 1 values it at 40. Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 49, while Agent 1 values it at 54. Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 59, while Agent 1 values it at 18. Assign to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it at 38, while Agent 1 values it at 41. Assign to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 0 values it at 13, while Agent 1 values it at 0. Assign to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it at 31, while Agent 1 values it at 76. Assign to Agent 1.
9. **Item 8:** Agent 0 values it at 58, while Agent 1 values it at 61. Assign to Agent 1.

Making sure the allocations are balanced, each agent should ideally end up with 4 or 5 items since there are 9 items. Here's a balanced allocation:

- Assign Items [0, 2, 4, 6] to Agent 0
- Assign Items [1, 3, 5, 7, 8] to Agent 1

This way, Agent 0 gets 4 items and Agent 1 gets 5 items, which is a fair distribution given the total of 9 items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
