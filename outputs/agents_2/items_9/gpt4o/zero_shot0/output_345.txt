Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  10  40  51  19  63  51  16  79
1   8  20  31  31  67  50  91  58  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while maintaining an integer number of items for each agent. We will use a fair division strategy to achieve this.

### Steps for Allocation:
1. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items.**
   - Agent 0: \(40 + 10 + 40 + 51 + 19 + 63 + 51 + 16 + 79 = 369\)
   - Agent 1: \(8 + 20 + 31 + 31 + 67 + 50 + 91 + 58 + 91 = 447\)

2. **Determine the proportion of total valuation each agent should receive.**
   - Agent 0 should receive approximately 45% of the total valuation.
   - Agent 1 should receive approximately 55% of the total valuation.

3. **Allocate items to each agent by looking at the highest valuations first.**

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 8: Value = 79
  - Item 5: Value = 63
  - Item 3: Value = 51
  - Item 6: Value = 51
  - Total valuation = \(79 + 63 + 51 + 51 = 244\)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 6: Value = 91
  - Item 8: Value = 91
  - Item 4: Value = 67
  - Item 7: Value = 58
  - Total valuation = \(91 + 91 + 67 + 58 = 307\)

Now, let's make sure that the total number of items allocated matches the total number of items available:

- Agent 0 has 4 items: [8, 5, 3, 6]
- Agent 1 has 4 items: [6, 8, 4, 7]

After adjusting for duplicates and ensuring each agent gets an equal number of items:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Items: [0, 3, 5, 8]
  - Total valuation: \(40 + 51 + 63 + 79 = 233\)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Items: [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
  - Total valuation: \(20 + 31 + 67 + 91 + 58 = 267\)

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
  "0": [0, 3, 5, 8],
  "1": [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Note that this solution is one of several possible allocations, and the specific distribution may vary based on additional fairness criteria or constraints.
