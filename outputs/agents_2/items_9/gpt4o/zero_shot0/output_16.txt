Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  20  58  42  31   8  97  47   9
1  52  12  47  94  61  15  80  29  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to distribute the items such that both agents get a fair share based on their valuations. Hereâ€™s how we can approach the allocation:

1. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent**: This helps in understanding which items are more valuable to each agent.
2. **Allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation**, ensuring that each agent receives an equal number of items or as close as possible given the total number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 56 + 20 + 58 + 42 + 31 + 8 + 97 + 47 + 9 = 368
- Agent 1's total valuation: 52 + 12 + 47 + 94 + 61 + 15 + 80 + 29 + 38 = 428

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Sort items for each agent based on their valuations**.
2. **Alternate picking the highest-valued remaining items for each agent** until all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** values (in order): 97 (item 6), 58 (item 2), 56 (item 0), 47 (item 7), 42 (item 3), 31 (item 4), 20 (item 1), 9 (item 8), 8 (item 5)
- **Agent 1** values (in order): 94 (item 3), 80 (item 6), 61 (item 4), 52 (item 0), 47 (item 2), 38 (item 8), 29 (item 7), 15 (item 5), 12 (item 1)

Let's allocate:

1. **Agent 0** takes item 6 (97).
2. **Agent 1** takes item 3 (94).
3. **Agent 0** takes item 2 (58).
4. **Agent 1** takes item 4 (61).
5. **Agent 0** takes item 0 (56).
6. **Agent 1** takes item 6 (80) (already taken, re-evaluate) -> take item 0 (52).
7. **Agent 0** takes item 7 (47).
8. **Agent 1** takes item 8 (38).
9. **Agent 0** takes item 3 (42) (already taken, re-evaluate).
10. **Agent 1** takes item 2 (47) (already taken, re-evaluate) -> take item 1 (12).
11. **Agent 0** takes item 4 (31).
12. **Agent 1** takes item 7 (29) (already taken, re-evaluate) -> take item 5 (15).
13. **Agent 0** takes item 1 (20).
14. **Agent 1** takes item 5 (15) (already taken, re-evaluate) -> take item 8 (9) (already taken, re-evaluate).
15. **Agent 0** takes item 8 (9) (already taken, re-evaluate) -> take item 5 (8).

**Final Allocation**:
```json
{
    "0": [6, 2, 0, 7, 4, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 0, 8, 1, 5]
}
```

Note: Ensure that each agent receives an equal number of items or as close as possible. Adjust allocations if necessary.
