Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  10  99  74  30  28  28  35  58
1  29  27   7  92  11   6  96  56  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Given the valuations, we want to ensure that each agent's total valuation is as close as possible, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items:
   - Agent 0: 76 + 10 + 99 + 74 + 30 + 28 + 28 + 35 + 58 = 438
   - Agent 1: 29 + 27 + 7 + 92 + 11 + 6 + 96 + 56 + 97 = 421

2. Aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here's a possible allocation based on trying to balance total valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
  - Total valuation: 76 + 99 + 30 + 28 + 35 = 268
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 6, 8
  - Total valuation: 27 + 92 + 96 + 97 = 312

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives based on the given valuations.
