Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51   7  17   4  22  82  44   7  82
1  66  91  18  41  14  84  65  13  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. A common method for such allocation is to use a greedy approach based on the difference in valuations for each item. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the difference in value that both agents place on each item.
2. Assign the item to the agent who values it more.
3. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's calculate and allocate:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value | Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| 0    | 51            | 66            | -15                            |
| 1    | 7             | 91            | -84                            |
| 2    | 17            | 18            | -1                             |
| 3    | 4             | 41            | -37                            |
| 4    | 22            | 14            | 8                              |
| 5    | 82            | 84            | -2                             |
| 6    | 44            | 65            | -21                            |
| 7    | 7             | 13            | -6                             |
| 8    | 82            | 52            | 30                             |

Now, assign the items to the agents based on who values them more:

- Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are valued more by Agent 1.
- Items 4 and 8 are valued more by Agent 0.

Let's allocate the items to ensure fairness:

Agent 0:
- Allocate items: 4, 8
- Total value: 22 + 82 = 104

Agent 1:
- Allocate items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Total value: 66 + 91 + 18 + 41 + 84 + 65 + 13 = 378

Since there are 9 items, each agent must get at least 4 items. To balance, we can adjust the allocation of some items:

Final adjustment:

Agent 0:
- Allocate items: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Total value: 51 + 22 + 44 + 82 = 199

Agent 1:
- Allocate items: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Total value: 91 + 18 + 41 + 84 + 13 = 247

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items while considering the total value each agent receives.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
