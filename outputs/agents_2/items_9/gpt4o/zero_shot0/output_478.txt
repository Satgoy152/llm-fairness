Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  34  16  92  33  28  80  61  78
1  10  82  21  80  27  23  67  73  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a balanced number of items. Given there are 9 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally receive about 4 to 5 items.

Let's approach this by assigning items based on the highest valuations for each agent, while maintaining a balanced distribution of items:

1. First, identify the top-valued items for each agent.
2. Assign items to agents, ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 3: 92
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 6: 80
  - Item 8: 78
  - Item 7: 61
  - Item 1: 34
  - Item 4: 33
  - Item 5: 28
  - Item 2: 16

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 1: 82
  - Item 3: 80
  - Item 7: 73
  - Item 6: 67
  - Item 2: 21
  - Item 4: 27
  - Item 5: 23
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 8: 16

Let's allocate based on maximizing each agent's valuation:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (92 vs. 80)
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (82 vs. 34)
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (64 vs. 10)
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (80 vs. 67)
5. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (73 vs. 61)
6. Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (78 vs. 16)
7. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (21 vs. 16)
8. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (27 vs. 33)
9. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (23 vs. 28)

Now, let's check the distribution:

- Agent 0 has items: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Agent 1 has items: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7

This allocation gives each agent either 4 or 5 items, balancing the total number of items distributed while maximizing each agent's valuation.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
