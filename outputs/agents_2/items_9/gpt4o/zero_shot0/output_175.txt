Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  33  38  28   7  28  84  21  80
1  85  98  34   8  28  51  35  24  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple approach that attempts to balance the total valuation that each agent receives. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Try to distribute items such that the total valuation is balanced.

Let's calculate the total valuation first:

- Agent 0: 4 + 33 + 38 + 28 + 7 + 28 + 84 + 21 + 80 = 323
- Agent 1: 85 + 98 + 34 + 8 + 28 + 51 + 35 + 24 + 57 = 420

Next, let's assign the items to balance the total valuations:

1. We'll start by assigning items to the agent who values each item more until the valuations are as balanced as possible.
2. We'll then adjust the allocations if one agent has significantly more total valuation than the other.

Here's one potential allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (since 85 > 4)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (since 98 > 33)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (since 38 > 34)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (since 28 > 8)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (since 28 = 28, choose any)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (since 51 > 28)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (since 84 > 35)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (since 21 > 24)
- Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (since 80 > 57)

After this allocation, we can check the total valuations:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 38 + 28 + 84 + 21 + 80 = 251
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 85 + 98 + 28 + 51 = 262

This allocation looks reasonably fair given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5]
}
```
