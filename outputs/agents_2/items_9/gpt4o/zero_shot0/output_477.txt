Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35   7   5  77  60   6  21  11  93
1  75  98  11  85  92  85  52  50  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35  7  5 77 60  6 21 11 93]
 [75 98 11 85 92 85 52 50 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use a method such as the envy-free allocation or maximizing the total valuation. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [35, 7, 5, 77, 60, 6, 21, 11, 93]
Agent 1: [75, 98, 11, 85, 92, 85, 52, 50, 32]
```

We'll aim to allocate the items so that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. A simple way to do this is by ensuring that the total value each agent receives is as high as possible given their preferences.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Compare the valuations of each item for both agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more.
3. Ensure that both agents receive approximately half of the items (since there are 9 items, one agent will receive 5 items and the other 4).

### Allocation:

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it more (75 vs. 35).
- **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it more (98 vs. 7).
- **Item 2:** Agent 1 values it more (11 vs. 5).
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it more (77 vs. 85).
- **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it more (92 vs. 60).
- **Item 5:** Agent 1 values it more (85 vs. 6).
- **Item 6:** Agent 1 values it more (52 vs. 21).
- **Item 7:** Agent 1 values it more (50 vs. 11).
- **Item 8:** Agent 0 values it more (93 vs. 32).

Agent 1 would receive more items based on valuation alone, so we need to adjust to ensure fairness in number of items:

- Allocate items 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 to Agent 1.
- Allocate items 3, 6, 7, 8 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair number of items, with Agent 0 receiving 4 items and Agent 1 receiving 5 items.
