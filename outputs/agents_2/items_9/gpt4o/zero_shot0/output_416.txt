Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  32  24  56  88  18  36  39  23
1  28   1  50  93  34   7  50  64  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that both agents receive an integer number of items. One approach to achieve fair allocation is to use the idea of maximizing the sum of values for each agent, while ensuring that the distribution remains balanced.

Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** prefers items with higher valuations for them. Items with the highest values for Agent 0 are: 88 (item 4), 62 (item 0), and 56 (item 3).

2. **Agent 1** prefers items with higher valuations for them. Items with the highest values for Agent 1 are: 93 (item 3), 64 (item 7), and 50 (items 2 and 6).

By observing the valuations, we try to maximize the total value each agent receives, while keeping the distribution fair.

Let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 4, 5, 6, 8
  - Total value: 62 (item 0) + 88 (item 4) + 18 (item 5) + 36 (item 6) + 23 (item 8) = 227

- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 2, 3, 7
  - Total value: 1 (item 1) + 50 (item 2) + 93 (item 3) + 64 (item 7) = 208

This distribution gives each agent a roughly equal valuation total while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7]
}
```
