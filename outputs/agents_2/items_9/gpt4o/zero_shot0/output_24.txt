Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  40  87  83  22  80  99  65  29
1  80  48  28  44  58  12  50  92  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 40 87 83 22 80 99 65 29]
 [80 48 28 44 58 12 50 92 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring the number of items allocated to each is balanced. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would get if they received all items and then aim to allocate so that each agent's total value is as close as possible.

2. Start by allocating the items with the largest difference in valuations to the agent that values them more, to ensure each agent gets significant value.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: [94, 40, 87, 83, 22, 80, 99, 65, 29]
- Agent 1: [80, 48, 28, 44, 58, 12, 50, 92, 66]

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 94, and Agent 1 values it at 80. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 40, and Agent 1 values it at 48. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 87, and Agent 1 values it at 28. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 83, and Agent 1 values it at 44. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 22, and Agent 1 values it at 58. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 80, and Agent 1 values it at 12. Allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 99, and Agent 1 values it at 50. Allocate to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 65, and Agent 1 values it at 92. Allocate to Agent 1.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 29, and Agent 1 values it at 66. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 7, 8]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, with a balanced number of items allocated to each.
