Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  83  11  77  91  25  90  12  55
1  39  31  55  88  17  45  83   9  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by both agents and aim for an allocation that maximizes fairness. One common approach to achieve fairness is to use the concept of "envy-freeness," where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation to their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 60
- Item 1: 83
- Item 2: 11
- Item 3: 77
- Item 4: 91
- Item 5: 25
- Item 6: 90
- Item 7: 12
- Item 8: 55

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 39
- Item 1: 31
- Item 2: 55
- Item 3: 88
- Item 4: 17
- Item 5: 45
- Item 6: 83
- Item 7: 9
- Item 8: 88

To achieve a fair allocation, let's start by allocating items based on which agent values them more, while ensuring each agent gets an equal or nearly equal number of items.

1. Compare item valuations and allocate the item to the agent with the higher valuation:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (60) > Agent 1 (39) --> Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (83) > Agent 1 (31) --> Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (55) > Agent 0 (11) --> Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (88) > Agent 0 (77) --> Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (91) > Agent 1 (17) --> Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (45) > Agent 0 (25) --> Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (90) > Agent 1 (83) --> Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (12) > Agent 1 (9) --> Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 8: Agent 1 (88) = Agent 0 (55) --> Assign to Agent 1 (since they have fewer items)

2. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items while being fair:
   - Agent 0: [0, 1, 4, 6, 7]
   - Agent 1: [2, 3, 5, 8]

This results in a fair allocation with each agent receiving four items.

Final Allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 8]
}
```
