Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  85  52  47  55   4  68  56  52
1  79  89  61  83  53  79  37  88  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the satisfaction of both agents, given their valuations. One simple approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm, where each agent is assigned items such that the total value of the items assigned to each agent is as balanced as possible. 

Let's go through the process:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items:
   - Agent 0: 15 + 85 + 52 + 47 + 55 + 4 + 68 + 56 + 52 = 434
   - Agent 1: 79 + 89 + 61 + 83 + 53 + 79 + 37 + 88 + 18 = 587

2. Aim to balance the total value of items allocated to each agent while ensuring each gets an integer number of items.

3. Sort the items based on the difference in valuation between the two agents (|v1 - v0|), and start allocating items to each agent trying to balance the total value:

   Differences:
   - Item 0: |79 - 15| = 64
   - Item 1: |89 - 85| = 4
   - Item 2: |61 - 52| = 9
   - Item 3: |83 - 47| = 36
   - Item 4: |53 - 55| = 2
   - Item 5: |79 - 4| = 75
   - Item 6: |37 - 68| = 31
   - Item 7: |88 - 56| = 32
   - Item 8: |18 - 52| = 34

4. Allocate items:
   - Start with items where the valuation difference is the smallest and allocate based on which agent values them more.

After applying this method, here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
