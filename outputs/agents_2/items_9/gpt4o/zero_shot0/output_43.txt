Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  15  93  84  35  21  91  96  13
1  38  26  98  65  16  79  21  78  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of both agents. One approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness or trying to equalize the total value each agent receives as closely as possible. Here's one possible allocation:

Agent 0's total valuation: 
- Items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Values: 5, 15, 93, 84, 35, 21, 91, 96, 13
- Total value: 453

Agent 1's total valuation: 
- Items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Values: 38, 26, 98, 65, 16, 79, 21, 78, 22
- Total value: 443

To achieve a fair allocation, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent.
2. Aim to divide the items such that each agent receives approximately half of the total value.

After considering these factors, here is one way to allocate the items:

Agent 0 receives items: [0, 3, 6, 7]
Agent 1 receives items: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]

Let's verify:

- Agent 0's total value: 5 (item 0) + 84 (item 3) + 91 (item 6) + 96 (item 7) = 276
- Agent 1's total value: 26 (item 1) + 98 (item 2) + 16 (item 4) + 79 (item 5) + 22 (item 8) = 292

The allocation is fairly balanced in terms of total value each agent receives. Now, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
}
```
