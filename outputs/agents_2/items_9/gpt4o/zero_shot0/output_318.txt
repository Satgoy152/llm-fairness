Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38   1  72  74  28  25  29  96  94
1  16  65  59  77  11  11  13  77  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. A possible approach is to allocate items based on the highest relative value each agent has for them.

Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Allocate items by iterating over them and assigning each item to the agent who values it more, ensuring that the agent does not end up with significantly fewer items than the other.

Let's proceed with this approach:

Agent 0's total valuation: 457  
Agent 1's total valuation: 416

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Compare the valuations of both agents for each item.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.
3. After allocation, ensure that both agents have roughly equal numbers of items.

Allocations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (38 vs 16)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (1 vs 65)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (72 vs 59)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (74 vs 77)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (28 vs 11)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (25 vs 11)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (29 vs 13)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (96 vs 77)
- Item 8: Agent 1 (94 vs 87)

Final Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the total value according to their valuations.
