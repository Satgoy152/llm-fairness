Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  68  85  83  20  97  28  32  78
1  31  72  30  46  36  49  95  71  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a set of items such that their total valuation of those items is as balanced as possible. We can approach this by trying different combinations and comparing the total valuations for each agent.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each possible allocation and select the one that minimizes the difference in total valuations between the two agents:

1. Calculate the total valuations for each agent if they receive each item:
   - Agent 0: [19, 68, 85, 83, 20, 97, 28, 32, 78]
   - Agent 1: [31, 72, 30, 46, 36, 49, 95, 71, 58]

2. Initially, calculate the total valuation for all items:
   - Total for Agent 0: 19 + 68 + 85 + 83 + 20 + 97 + 28 + 32 + 78 = 510
   - Total for Agent 1: 31 + 72 + 30 + 46 + 36 + 49 + 95 + 71 + 58 = 488

3. The goal is to divide the items such that the sum of valuations is as close as possible for both agents.

Let's try an allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 1, 3, 5, 8]
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 19 + 68 + 83 + 97 + 78 = 345

- Agent 1 receives items: [2, 4, 6, 7]
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 30 + 36 + 95 + 71 = 232

This allocation gives us the following results:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 345
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 232

The difference in total valuations is 345 - 232 = 113.

Let's try another allocation to minimize this difference:

- Agent 0 receives items: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 68 + 85 + 83 + 97 + 32 = 365

- Agent 1 receives items: [0, 4, 6, 8]
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 31 + 36 + 95 + 58 = 220

The difference in total valuations is now 365 - 220 = 145.

Both approaches do not perfectly balance the total valuations, but the first allocation has a smaller difference, so we'll go with that:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5, 8],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
