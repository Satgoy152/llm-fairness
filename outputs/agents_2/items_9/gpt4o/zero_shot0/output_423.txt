Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  91  11  59  35  32  66  29  36
1  95  52  57  93  14  17  57  82  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [95 52 57 93 14 17 57 82 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. We can use a simple greedy algorithm to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to each item.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure each agent gets about half of the items since there are 9 items, one agent will get 5 items and the other will get 4 items.

Let's go through the process:

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [32, 91, 11, 59, 35, 32, 66, 29, 36]
- Agent 1: [95, 52, 57, 93, 14, 17, 57, 82, 49]

### Item Allocation:
- Item 0: Agent 1 (95 > 32)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (91 > 52)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (57 > 11)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (93 > 59)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (35 > 14)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (32 > 17)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (66 > 57)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (82 > 29)
- Item 8: Agent 1 (49 > 36)

### Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 4, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 3, 7, 8]

Since Agent 0 has 4 items and Agent 1 has 5 items, we'll redistribute to balance the number of items:

Let's reallocate one item from Agent 1 to Agent 0. We choose the item that causes the least value loss for Agent 1:

- From Agent 1's items, the lowest value is item 8 (49).
- Reallocate item 8 from Agent 1 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 4, 5, 6, 8]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 3, 7]

Now, each agent has a fairly balanced number of items, and we've attempted to maximize the total value each agent receives.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 7]
}
```
