Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  55  24  85  93  55  99  12  84
1   4  44   3   3  79  60  24  85  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. 

First, let's calculate the total value each agent would receive if they were allocated all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 78 + 55 + 24 + 85 + 93 + 55 + 99 + 12 + 84 = 585
- Agent 1's total valuation: 4 + 44 + 3 + 3 + 79 + 60 + 24 + 85 + 45 = 347

Since each agent should receive approximately half of the items, we'll aim to distribute them such that the total value is reasonably balanced.

Here is a potential fair allocation based on balancing valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 78 + 24 + 85 + 55 + 99 + 84 = 425

- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 7
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 44 + 79 + 85 = 208

This allocation aims to give each agent approximately half of the total valuation. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, while also ensuring that both agents receive an integer number of items.
