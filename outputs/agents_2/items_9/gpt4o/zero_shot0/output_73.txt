Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  74  29   7  82  74  34  90   1
1  27  96   7  21  16  55  51   1  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [27 96  7 21 16 55 51  1 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives. This approach attempts to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as equal as possible.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation:

1. **Calculate total valuations for each agent based on initial allocation attempts.**
2. **Adjust allocations to balance total valuations.**

### Initial Allocation Strategy:
- Assign items based on the highest individual valuation for each item to balance them out.

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: [65, 74, 29, 7, 82, 74, 34, 90, 1]
- Agent 1: [27, 96, 7, 21, 16, 55, 51, 1, 93]

### Allocation Plan:
1. **Allocate the items to the agents based on maximizing their satisfaction:**

- Items 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 to Agent 0 based on higher valuations.
- Items 1, 2, 8 to Agent 1 based on higher valuations.

### Resulting Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 8]

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation for each agent by distributing the items according to their respective valuations.
