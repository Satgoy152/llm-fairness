Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  21  75  12  32  58  44  79  18
1  31  25  38  47  10  36  13  32  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim for a distribution where each agent gets a similar total valuation for the items they receive. Let's calculate the total valuation for both agents if each item was allocated optimally based on their individual preferences.

First, let's consider the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation for all items: 6 + 21 + 75 + 12 + 32 + 58 + 44 + 79 + 18 = 345
- Agent 1's total valuation for all items: 31 + 25 + 38 + 47 + 10 + 36 + 13 + 32 + 72 = 304

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize fairness:

1. Sort each item by the difference in valuation for both agents.
2. Allocate items in a way that balances the total valuation of items each agent receives.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 should receive items with high value according to their valuation.
- Agent 1 should receive items with high value according to their valuation.

By iterating and balancing, we reach a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 0, 4, 5, 6]
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 75 + 6 + 32 + 58 + 44 = 215
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 7, 8]
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 25 + 47 + 32 + 72 = 176

This allocation provides a more balanced distribution of total valuations between the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 7, 8]
}
```
