Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  57  85  71  37  65  63  63  88
1  77  57  70   4   4  82  93  54  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to balance the total value each agent receives. The goal is to ensure both agents are satisfied with their allocation based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and then proceed to allocate the items.

Agent 0 total valuation:
- Item 0: 28
- Item 1: 57
- Item 2: 85
- Item 3: 71
- Item 4: 37
- Item 5: 65
- Item 6: 63
- Item 7: 63
- Item 8: 88

Total for Agent 0 = 28 + 57 + 85 + 71 + 37 + 65 + 63 + 63 + 88 = 557

Agent 1 total valuation:
- Item 0: 77
- Item 1: 57
- Item 2: 70
- Item 3: 4
- Item 4: 4
- Item 5: 82
- Item 6: 93
- Item 7: 54
- Item 8: 86

Total for Agent 1 = 77 + 57 + 70 + 4 + 4 + 82 + 93 + 54 + 86 = 527

Now, to fairly allocate the items, we should try to balance the total value each agent receives. Let's proceed with an allocation:

1. Start by assigning items with significant difference in valuation:
   - Item 3 and 4 have very low valuation for Agent 1 but reasonable for Agent 0. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 6 has high valuation for Agent 1 and lower for Agent 0. Assign to Agent 1.

2. Allocate remaining items by trying to balance the total valuation:
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (77 vs 28)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (57 vs 57, tie-breaker)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (85 vs 70)
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (82 vs 65)
   - Assign Item 7 to Agent 1 (54 vs 63)
   - Assign Item 8 to Agent 0 (88 vs 86, tie-breaker)

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4, 8],
    "1": [0, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value for both agents as closely as possible given the constraints.
