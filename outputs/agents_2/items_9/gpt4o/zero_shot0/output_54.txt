Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  8  19  14  49  63  31  45  78  66
1  8   4  88  29  89  57  77  83  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach to achieve a fair allocation is using the concept of maximizing the total value while ensuring that the difference in total value between agents is minimized.

Let's calculate the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Sum of Valuations for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: 8 (agent 0) + 8 (agent 1) = 16
   - Item 1: 19 (agent 0) + 4 (agent 1) = 23
   - Item 2: 14 (agent 0) + 88 (agent 1) = 102
   - Item 3: 49 (agent 0) + 29 (agent 1) = 78
   - Item 4: 63 (agent 0) + 89 (agent 1) = 152
   - Item 5: 31 (agent 0) + 57 (agent 1) = 88
   - Item 6: 45 (agent 0) + 77 (agent 1) = 122
   - Item 7: 78 (agent 0) + 83 (agent 1) = 161
   - Item 8: 66 (agent 0) + 22 (agent 1) = 88

2. **Agent's Preferences (Based on Higher Individual Valuation):**
   - Agent 0: Prefers items 4, 7, 8, 3, 6, 1, 5, 2, 0
   - Agent 1: Prefers items 2, 4, 7, 6, 5, 3, 8, 0, 1

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items to agents based on their preferences, ensuring each agent receives nearly equal value.

4. **Allocation:**
   - Assign items to maximize each agent's total value while keeping total values balanced.

Using a balanced approach, we can allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives while considering their preferences.
