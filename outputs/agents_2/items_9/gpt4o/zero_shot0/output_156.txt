Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  53  95  77  29  29  86  29  57
1  40  97  91  93  48  88   0  35  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider the valuations and attempt to maximize fairness. One approach is to use a method similar to the "maximin allocation" or "egalitarian allocation," where each agent receives items such that the minimum value of the allocation is maximized.

Let's work through this:

1. **Calculate total valuations for each agent:**

   - Agent 0's total value for all items: \(7 + 53 + 95 + 77 + 29 + 29 + 86 + 29 + 57 = 462\)
   - Agent 1's total value for all items: \(40 + 97 + 91 + 93 + 48 + 88 + 0 + 35 + 51 = 543\)

2. **Allocation strategy:**

   We want to balance the allocation such that both agents feel they have received a fair share of the value. One way to do this is to alternate assigning high-value items to each agent while keeping an eye on the fairness.

3. **Allocate items:**

   - Agent 0 has higher valuation for item 2 (95) than Agent 1 (91), so give item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has higher valuation for item 1 (97) than Agent 0 (53), so give item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 has higher valuation for item 3 (93) than Agent 0 (77), so give item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 has higher valuation for item 6 (86) than Agent 1 (0), so give item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has higher valuation for item 5 (88) than Agent 0 (29), so give item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 has higher valuation for item 0 (7) than Agent 1 (40), so give item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has higher valuation for item 4 (48) than Agent 0 (29), so give item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 has higher valuation for item 7 (29) than Agent 1 (35), so give item 7 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 has higher valuation for item 8 (57) than Agent 1 (51), so give item 8 to Agent 0.

4. **Final allocations:**

   The allocations are as follows:

   ```json
   {
       "0": [0, 2, 6, 7, 8],
       "1": [1, 3, 4, 5]
   }
   ```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives and ensures each agent gets an integer number of items.
