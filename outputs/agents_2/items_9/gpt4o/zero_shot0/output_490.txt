Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  77  50   3  16  61  98  67   2
1  51  20  87  45  94   3  80  83  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item**: Add the valuations from both agents for each item to understand which items have higher overall value.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Individual Valuations**: Allocate items to the agent who values them the most, as long as it keeps the total number of items balanced between the agents.

3. **Balance Allocations**: Ensure that the number of items each agent receives is balanced. If one agent has more items, consider swapping items to balance the number of items while maintaining fairness in valuation.

Let's apply this approach:

### Step 1: Compare Valuations

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 at 51. (Allocate to Agent 1)
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 at 20. (Allocate to Agent 0)
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 at 87. (Allocate to Agent 1)
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 3, Agent 1 at 45. (Allocate to Agent 1)
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 16, Agent 1 at 94. (Allocate to Agent 1)
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 at 3. (Allocate to Agent 0)
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 at 80. (Allocate to Agent 0)
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 67, Agent 1 at 83. (Allocate to Agent 1)
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 at 79. (Allocate to Agent 1)

### Initial Allocation

- Agent 0: [1, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]

### Step 2: Balance Allocations

Currently, Agent 1 has more items than Agent 0. Let's attempt to balance the allocations:

- Swap Item 1 (Agent 0) with Item 3 (Agent 1):
  - Agent 0: [3, 5, 6]
  - Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8]

- Swap Item 5 (Agent 0) with Item 4 (Agent 1):
  - Agent 0: [3, 4, 6]
  - Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8]

### Verify Fairness

- Agent 0 total valuation: 3 (Item 3) + 16 (Item 4) + 98 (Item 6) = 117
- Agent 1 total valuation: 51 (Item 0) + 20 (Item 1) + 87 (Item 2) + 61 (Item 5) + 83 (Item 7) + 79 (Item 8) = 381

Agent 1 has a higher total valuation, but the allocation is balanced in terms of the number of items.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance both the number of items and the values each agent receives.
