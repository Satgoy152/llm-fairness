Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  75  71   7  98  15  86  63  10
1   1  87  87  25  87  36  98  22  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and then allocate the items to balance the total valuation.

Agent 0's total valuation:
- Item 0: 34
- Item 1: 75
- Item 2: 71
- Item 3: 7
- Item 4: 98
- Item 5: 15
- Item 6: 86
- Item 7: 63
- Item 8: 10

Total valuation for Agent 0: 459

Agent 1's total valuation:
- Item 0: 1
- Item 1: 87
- Item 2: 87
- Item 3: 25
- Item 4: 87
- Item 5: 36
- Item 6: 98
- Item 7: 22
- Item 8: 81

Total valuation for Agent 1: 524

### Allocation Strategy

To achieve a fair allocation, I will try to balance the total valuation by allocating items that have relatively high valuations for each agent in a way that equalizes their total perceived value.

After analyzing different possible allocations, here is one that tries to balance the valuations:

- Agent 0 is allocated items: [0, 2, 4, 6, 7]
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 34 + 71 + 98 + 86 + 63 = 352
- Agent 1 is allocated items: [1, 3, 5, 8]
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 87 + 25 + 36 + 81 = 229

This allocation aims to balance the distribution as much as possible given the initial valuations.

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 8]
}
```
