Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  67  94  45  96  86  10  94  48
1   9  50  43  35  82  97  59  81  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple method where we try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Since there are two agents and nine items, each agent will receive about half of the items. Here's how we can approach the allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Sort the items based on the difference in valuation between the two agents.
3. Assign items to agents, prioritizing giving each agent items that they value significantly more than the other agent.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items:

- Agent 0's total value for all items: \(32 + 67 + 94 + 45 + 96 + 86 + 10 + 94 + 48 = 572\)
- Agent 1's total value for all items: \(9 + 50 + 43 + 35 + 82 + 97 + 59 + 81 + 16 = 472\)

Next, we calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents, and allocate items based on these differences:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value | Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| 0    | 32            | 9             | 23                             |
| 1    | 67            | 50            | 17                             |
| 2    | 94            | 43            | 51                             |
| 3    | 45            | 35            | 10                             |
| 4    | 96            | 82            | 14                             |
| 5    | 86            | 97            | -11                            |
| 6    | 10            | 59            | -49                            |
| 7    | 94            | 81            | 13                             |
| 8    | 48            | 16            | 32                             |

Now, we sort the items based on the absolute value of the difference (whether positive or negative), and allocate them to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 should receive items with the highest positive difference.
- Agent 1 should receive items with the highest negative difference.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [2, 8, 0, 1]
- Agent 1: [6, 5, 3, 4, 7]

With this approach, agent 0 receives a total value of 32 + 67 + 94 + 48 = 241, and agent 1 receives a total value of 59 + 97 + 35 + 82 + 81 = 354.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8, 0, 1],
    "1": [6, 5, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
