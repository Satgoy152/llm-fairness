Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  75  58  15  49  69  32  40  88
1   1  31  46   7  55  63  82  57  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 1 31 46  7 55 63 82 57 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will attempt to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We'll employ a simple heuristic by assigning each item to the agent who values it more, while ensuring that each agent receives a balanced number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Compare the valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 values it at 1. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 values it at 31. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 46. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 values it at 7. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 values it at 55. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 values it at 63. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 values it at 82. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 values it at 57. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 values it at 16. Assign to Agent 0.

2. Check the balance of items:
   - Agent 0: 6 items (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
   - Agent 1: 3 items (4, 6, 7)

To balance the allocation, we can adjust item 3 allocation:
- Reassign item 3 to Agent 1, who now gets an additional item.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2, 5, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4, 6, 7]

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
