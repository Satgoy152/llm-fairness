Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  97  94  80  35  34  41  73  93
1  61  60  23  58  23  12  24  33  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy called "envy-free allocation" or "maximizing the utilitarian social welfare". The goal is to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible, minimizing envy between agents.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive for each allocation:

1. Calculate the total value for each item for each agent.
2. Use a greedy algorithm to allocate items by iteratively assigning the next most valuable item to the agent who would benefit most from it, given the current allocation.

Let's work through this allocation process:

### Agent Valuations:
- Agent 0: [71, 97, 94, 80, 35, 34, 41, 73, 93]
- Agent 1: [61, 60, 23, 58, 23, 12, 24, 33, 11]

### Allocation Process:
1. Start with empty allocations for both agents.
2. Sort items based on the difference in valuations (absolute difference) between Agent 0 and Agent 1.
3. Allocate each item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item, unless doing so would create an imbalance in the total number of items allocated.

### Sorted Items by Difference in Valuation and Allocation:
- Item 1: Agent 0 (97 vs. 60)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (94 vs. 23)
- Item 0: Agent 0 (71 vs. 61)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (80 vs. 58)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (93 vs. 11)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (73 vs. 33)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (35 vs. 23)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (41 vs. 24)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (34 vs. 12)

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: [5]

### JSON Result:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items. Note that due to the constraints, one agent receives more items than the other, but the allocation is based on maximizing the total value for each agent.
