Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4  5   6   7   8
0   6  93  75  72  92  0   4  41   1
1  74  29  45   8   0  9  82  28  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items and attempt to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total perceived value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0's Valuations:** [6, 93, 75, 72, 92, 0, 4, 41, 1]
- **Agent 1's Valuations:** [74, 29, 45, 8, 0, 9, 82, 28, 41]

We aim to allocate the items in such a way that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their total valuation.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify Items with High Disparity:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it significantly more (74 vs 6).
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it significantly more (93 vs 29).
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it significantly more (82 vs 4).

2. **Allocate High-Valuation Items:**
   - Allocate items to the agent who values them significantly more.

3. **Balance Remaining Items:**
   - Distribute the remaining items to balance the overall valuation.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0 Gets:**
  - Items where Agent 0's valuation is significantly higher.
  - Allocate: [1, 2, 3, 4]

- **Agent 1 Gets:**
  - Items where Agent 1's valuation is significantly higher.
  - Allocate: [0, 5, 6, 7, 8]

### Resulting Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation considers the preferences of both agents and ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
