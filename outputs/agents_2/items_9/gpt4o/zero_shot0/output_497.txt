Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  62  36  36  38  40  25  88   5
1  17  80  32  49  33  63  56  23  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the "maximum envy-free" principle, which aims to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the other agent does. The goal is to minimize envy between the two agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Identify the most valued items for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 7 the most (88).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (80).

2. **Allocate the most valued items**: 
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Continue allocation based on remaining highest values**:
   - Agent 0's remaining highest valued item is item 5 (40).
   - Agent 1's remaining highest valued item is item 8 (85).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 1.

4. **Allocate remaining items by balancing the total valuation**:
   - Remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
   - Calculate total valuation for each agent's current allocation:
     - Agent 0: 88 (item 7) + 40 (item 5) = 128
     - Agent 1: 80 (item 1) + 85 (item 8) = 165
   - Allocate based on each agent's highest remaining priority to balance the total valuation.

5. **Final allocation**:
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (36).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (17).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (49).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (38).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (56).

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 8, 0, 3, 6]
}
```
