Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  57  28  26  19  32  67  31   3
1  61  11  47  96   9   5  45  42  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim for a fair distribution based on their valuations. One way to do this is by using the "envy-free" principle, which tries to ensure that each agent gets a bundle of items that they value at least as much as the other agent values their bundle.

Here's one possible allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item across both agents.
2. Allocate items such that the total value for each agent is approximately equal.

Following this process:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [5, 57, 28, 26, 19, 32, 67, 31, 3]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [61, 11, 47, 96, 9, 5, 45, 42, 62]

Total value of items:
- Item 0: 66
- Item 1: 68
- Item 2: 75
- Item 3: 122
- Item 4: 28
- Item 5: 37
- Item 6: 112
- Item 7: 73
- Item 8: 65

Allocating items to balance total valuation:

- Assign items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 0, 5, 6, and 7 to Agent 0.

This allocation attempts to balance the valuation each agent receives.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 8]
}
```
