Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  16  40   4  79  20  47  57  75
1  34  38  20  19  33  94  15  77  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [34 38 20 19 33 94 15 77 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a simple greedy approach by assigning items based on which agent values them more, alternating when the valuations are equal, or when necessary to balance the number of items each agent receives.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (34 vs 11).
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (38 vs 16).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (40 vs 20).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (19 vs 4).
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (79 vs 33).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (94 vs 20).
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (47 vs 15).
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (77 vs 57).
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (75 vs 42).

Now, let's check the allocation to ensure each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4, 6, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 3, 5, 7]

Both agents receive a fair number of items (Agent 0 gets 4 items, and Agent 1 gets 5 items).

Now, here is the allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
