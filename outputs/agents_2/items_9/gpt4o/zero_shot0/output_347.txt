Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2  3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3  11  89  9  58  58  25  74  17
1  55  24  23  5  66  32  13  70  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a greedy approach by assigning items to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations and allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 55, and Agent 0 values it at 3. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 11, and Agent 1 values it at 24. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 89, and Agent 1 values it at 23. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 9, and Agent 1 values it at 5. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 58, and Agent 1 values it at 66. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 58, and Agent 1 values it at 32. Allocate to Agent 0.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 25, and Agent 1 values it at 13. Allocate to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 74, and Agent 1 values it at 70. Allocate to Agent 0.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 17, and Agent 1 values it at 74. Allocate to Agent 1.

After the allocation, the items are distributed as follows:

Agent 0: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7

Agent 1: 0, 1, 4, 8

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 8]
}
```
