Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  2  80  35  23   3  12  55  70
1  58  5  12   5  32  17  40  22  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a set of items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. We will approach this by considering each agent's preferences and trying to maximize their total valuation while ensuring both agents receive approximately the same total value.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

- First, we calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:
  - Agent 0's total valuation: 57 + 2 + 80 + 35 + 23 + 3 + 12 + 55 + 70 = 297
  - Agent 1's total valuation: 58 + 5 + 12 + 5 + 32 + 17 + 40 + 22 + 72 = 263

- Next, we aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as equal as possible. We will do this by assigning items starting with the highest difference in valuation between the two agents.

Here's a possible allocation based on the preferences given:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (80 vs. 12)
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (58 vs. 57)
3. Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (72 vs. 70)
4. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (55 vs. 22)
5. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (40 vs. 12)
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (32 vs. 23)
7. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (35 vs. 5)
8. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (17 vs. 3)
9. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (2 vs. 5)

After this allocation, the total valuations are:

- Agent 0: 80 (item 2) + 70 (item 8) + 35 (item 3) + 55 (item 7) + 2 (item 1) = 242
- Agent 1: 58 (item 0) + 72 (item 8) + 40 (item 6) + 32 (item 4) + 17 (item 5) = 219

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 7, 1],
    "1": [0, 8, 6, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations for each agent as closely as possible given their preferences.
