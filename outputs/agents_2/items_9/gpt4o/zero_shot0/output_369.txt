Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  68  16  34  12  32  89  69  93
1  31  41  78  47  44  28  14  73  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the idea of maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. One common approach for such problems is to use algorithms like the Hungarian algorithm or other optimization techniques. However, given the small number of agents and items, a simpler approach can be employed, such as a greedy method.

Let's consider the valuations and aim to distribute the items to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent:

1. **Agent 0's total valuation**: 58 + 68 + 16 + 34 + 12 + 32 + 89 + 69 + 93 = 471
2. **Agent 1's total valuation**: 31 + 41 + 78 + 47 + 44 + 28 + 14 + 73 + 85 = 441

Based on these total valuations, we observe that Agent 0 generally has higher valuations for the items. A fair allocation would try to balance the overall value received by each agent. One way to do this is to alternate allocation, starting with the highest value item, and decide based on who values it more significantly.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

- Item 8 (valuations: 93, 85) goes to Agent 0.
- Item 6 (valuations: 89, 14) goes to Agent 0.
- Item 7 (valuations: 69, 73) goes to Agent 1.
- Item 2 (valuations: 16, 78) goes to Agent 1.
- Item 0 (valuations: 58, 31) goes to Agent 0.
- Item 1 (valuations: 68, 41) goes to Agent 0.
- Item 3 (valuations: 34, 47) goes to Agent 1.
- Item 4 (valuations: 12, 44) goes to Agent 1.
- Item 5 (valuations: 32, 28) goes to Agent 0.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Valuations of items [8, 6, 0, 1, 5] = 93 + 89 + 58 + 68 + 32 = 340
- Agent 1: Valuations of items [7, 2, 3, 4] = 73 + 78 + 47 + 44 = 242

The allocation seems fair as both agents receive high-value items according to their preferences. Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 6, 0, 1, 5],
    "1": [7, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
