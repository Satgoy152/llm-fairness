Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  31  37  27  62  40  21  95  91
1  64  12  62  25  18   1  64  47  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [64 12 62 25 18  1 64 47 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the method of "envy-free" allocation, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of the other agent.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 total value: 29 + 31 + 37 + 27 + 62 + 40 + 21 + 95 + 91 = 433
- Agent 1 total value: 64 + 12 + 62 + 25 + 18 + 1 + 64 + 47 + 52 = 345

Now, let's try to allocate the items such that each agent gets items with roughly equal value according to their own valuations.

One simple approach is to sort the items based on each agent's valuation and then alternate picking items:

1. For Agent 0:
   - Sorted items by Agent 0's valuation: 7, 8, 4, 2, 5, 1, 0, 3, 6
2. For Agent 1:
   - Sorted items by Agent 1's valuation: 0, 6, 2, 8, 7, 3, 4, 1, 5

Let's allocate items alternatively based on the sorted order:

- Agent 0 picks: 7, 4, 5, 3
- Agent 1 picks: 8, 2, 0, 6, 1

Now let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4, 5, 3],
    "1": [8, 2, 0, 6, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their own valuations without envy.
