Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  67  19  97  98  99   8  21  88
1  82  58  37  25   8  31  89  89  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that balances the total valuation each agent receives. Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all the items and then try to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

**Agent 0's Valuations:**
- Item 0: 50
- Item 1: 67
- Item 2: 19
- Item 3: 97
- Item 4: 98
- Item 5: 99
- Item 6: 8
- Item 7: 21
- Item 8: 88

**Total valuation for Agent 0:** 547

**Agent 1's Valuations:**
- Item 0: 82
- Item 1: 58
- Item 2: 37
- Item 3: 25
- Item 4: 8
- Item 5: 31
- Item 6: 89
- Item 7: 89
- Item 8: 85

**Total valuation for Agent 1:** 504

To balance the total valuations as evenly as possible, we'll allocate items with a focus on balancing these totals. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign items that have a high difference in valuation to the agent valuing them higher.
2. Balance the total valuations between the two agents.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign items to maximize the difference:
  - Agent 0: Items 3, 4, 5, 6
  - Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2, 7, 8

**Valuation Totals After Allocation:**
- Agent 0: 97 (Item 3) + 98 (Item 4) + 99 (Item 5) + 8 (Item 6) = 302
- Agent 1: 82 (Item 0) + 58 (Item 1) + 37 (Item 2) + 89 (Item 7) + 85 (Item 8) = 351

These allocations provide a reasonable balance in the perceived value each agent receives:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and the distribution of value is relatively balanced between the two agents.
