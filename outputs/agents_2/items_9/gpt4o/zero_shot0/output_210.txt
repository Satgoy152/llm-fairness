Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  85  22  61  14  40  95  67   5
1  56  21  16   8  86  20  95  69  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent perceives from their allocated items while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. One way to achieve this is to use a greedy strategy, where we allocate items based on which agent values them more, ensuring that each agent ends up with four or five items.

Let's go through the items one by one and allocate them to the agent who values them more.

1. Item 0: Both agents value it equally (56). We can assign it to either agent. Let's assign it to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 85, while Agent 1 values it at 21. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 22, while Agent 1 values it at 16. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 61, while Agent 1 values it at 8. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 14, while Agent 1 values it at 86. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 40, while Agent 1 values it at 20. Allocate to Agent 0.
7. Item 6: Both agents value it equally (95). We can assign it to either agent. Let's assign it to Agent 1.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 67, while Agent 1 values it at 69. Allocate to Agent 1.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 5, while Agent 1 values it at 81. Allocate to Agent 1.

At this point, Agent 0 has five items and Agent 1 has four items. This allocation ensures that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items, and each item is allocated to the agent who values it more, where possible.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
