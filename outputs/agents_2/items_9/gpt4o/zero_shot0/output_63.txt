Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  36  75  61  49  34   9  97   3
1  26  37  31  31  78   6  25  11  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 36 75 61 49 34  9 97  3]
 [26 37 31 31 78  6 25 11 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim for each agent to receive items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's examine the valuations and allocate the items:

Agent 0's valuations: [65, 36, 75, 61, 49, 34, 9, 97, 3]  
Agent 1's valuations: [26, 37, 31, 31, 78, 6, 25, 11, 77]  

First, we calculate the total value for each agent if they got all items:  

- Total value for Agent 0: 65 + 36 + 75 + 61 + 49 + 34 + 9 + 97 + 3 = 429  
- Total value for Agent 1: 26 + 37 + 31 + 31 + 78 + 6 + 25 + 11 + 77 = 322  

Now, to balance this, we need to distribute items such that each agent gets a fair share of the total valuation.

A reasonable approach is to prioritize items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents and allocate accordingly. Let's allocate:

1. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 at 11. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 at 78. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 at 31. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 3, Agent 1 at 77. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 at 26. Allocate to Agent 0.
6. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 at 37. Allocate to Agent 1.
7. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 at 31. Allocate to Agent 0.
8. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 at 6. Allocate to Agent 0.
9. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 at 25. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 4, 6, 8

Let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 8]
}
```

This distribution attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives as much as possible based on their preferences.
