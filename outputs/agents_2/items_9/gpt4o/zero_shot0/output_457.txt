Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  23  98  85  79  67  72  61  92
1  22  85  73  18  60  99   3  32  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [22 85 73 18 60 99  3 32 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring a fair distribution of the number of items.

Here are the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [75, 23, 98, 85, 79, 67, 72, 61, 92]
Agent 1: [22, 85, 73, 18, 60, 99, 3, 32, 42]
```

To proceed:
1. Compare the valuations for each item and assign it to the agent with the higher valuation.
2. Ensure each agent receives approximately half of the items, i.e., 4 or 5 items each since there are 9 items.

Let's allocate:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it higher (75 vs. 22) - assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it higher (85 vs. 23) - assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it higher (98 vs. 73) - assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it higher (85 vs. 18) - assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it higher (79 vs. 60) - assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it higher (99 vs. 67) - assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it higher (72 vs. 3) - assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it higher (61 vs. 32) - assign to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it higher (92 vs. 42) - assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the number of items:
- Agent 0 has 7 items, which is more than 4 or 5, so we need to adjust to ensure fairness.

Reassign some items to ensure fairness:
- Reassign Item 7 to Agent 1, making it 6 items for Agent 0 and 3 for Agent 1.
- Reassign Item 4 to Agent 1, making 5 items for Agent 0 and 4 for Agent 1.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

Now, each agent has a fair number of items (5 for Agent 0 and 4 for Agent 1), and the allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent given the constraints.
