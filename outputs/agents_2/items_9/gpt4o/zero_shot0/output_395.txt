Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0   0  36  47   6  96  47   5  79
1  56  97  87  10  49  55  30  98  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated.

Let's evaluate the allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent can potentially achieve for all items:
   - Agent 0: 0 + 0 + 36 + 47 + 6 + 96 + 47 + 5 + 79 = 316
   - Agent 1: 56 + 97 + 87 + 10 + 49 + 55 + 30 + 98 + 52 = 534

2. To achieve a fair allocation, we can try to distribute items such that both agents receive approximately half of the total value of all items, which is \( (316 + 534) / 2 = 425 \).

3. We will assign the items based on which agent values them more, while trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (96 vs 55)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (5 vs 98)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (0 vs 97)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (36 vs 87)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (47 vs 30)
- Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (79 vs 52)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (0 vs 56)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (47 vs 10)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (6 vs 49)

Now let's check the total values:

- Agent 0 receives items: 5, 6, 8, 3
  - Total value = 96 + 47 + 79 + 47 = 269

- Agent 1 receives items: 7, 1, 2, 0, 4
  - Total value = 98 + 97 + 87 + 56 + 49 = 387

Although Agent 1 receives more value, this allocation maximizes each agent's value given the items they value most.

Now present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 8, 3],
    "1": [7, 1, 2, 0, 4]
}
```
