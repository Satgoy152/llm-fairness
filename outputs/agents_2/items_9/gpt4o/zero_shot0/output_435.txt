Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  87  70  57  49  62  76  15  78
1  28  13  54  26  97   1  55  25  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to use the "envy-free" allocation strategy, which seeks to make sure neither agent prefers the other's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations provided:

Agent 0:
- Items: [76, 87, 70, 57, 49, 62, 76, 15, 78]

Agent 1:
- Items: [28, 13, 54, 26, 97, 1, 55, 25, 94]

We can attempt to allocate the items by looking at the highest values for each agent and trying to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Start by allocating the items with the highest individual differences in value between agents. For example, item 4 has a high value for Agent 1 (97) and a low value for Agent 0 (49), so it should go to Agent 1.

2. Continue by selecting items with high values for each agent while considering the overall balance.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Assign items to Agent 1 that have significantly higher value for them than Agent 0: Items 4, 8, 2.
- Assign items to Agent 0 that have significantly higher value for them than Agent 1: Items 1, 0, 6.
- Balance the remaining items between the agents: 

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 1, 3, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: [2, 4, 7, 8]

This allocation is designed to fairly distribute total value while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.
