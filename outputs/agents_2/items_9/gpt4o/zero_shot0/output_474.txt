Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  62  89  80  38  14  44  68  55
1  67  60  24  89  20  27   8  54  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while taking into account their valuations, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. A simple method for this is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it more until all items are allocated.

Let's calculate the allocations step by step:

1. Start by comparing the valuation of each item for both agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.
3. If both agents value an item equally, we will need to make a decision to balance the total number of items each agent receives.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (67 vs. 8).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (62 vs. 60).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (89 vs. 24).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (89 vs. 80).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (38 vs. 20).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (27 vs. 14).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (44 vs. 8).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (68 vs. 54).
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (55 vs. 26).

Now, let's assign the items:

- Agent 0 will receive items 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
- Agent 1 will receive items 0, 3, and 5.

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it more, thereby maximizing the total valuation for each agent.

The final allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
