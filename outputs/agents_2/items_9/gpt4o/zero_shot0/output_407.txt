Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  46  57  54  43   7   7  16  26
1  45  24  91  37  20  66  78  52  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use a variant of the "Greedy" algorithm, which assigns each item to the agent who values it more, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 values items as follows: [48, 46, 57, 54, 43, 7, 7, 16, 26]
   - Agent 1 values items as follows: [45, 24, 91, 37, 20, 66, 78, 52, 78]

2. **Calculate Differences**:
   - Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.

3. **Priority Allocation**:
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it more based on the difference.

4. **Balancing**:
   - Ensure each agent ends up with an integer number of items, which may involve adjusting the allocation to maintain a fair distribution.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (48 vs. 45)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (46 vs. 24)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (57 vs. 91)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (54 vs. 37)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (43 vs. 20)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (7 vs. 66)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (7 vs. 78)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (16 vs. 52)
- Item 8: Agent 1 (26 vs. 78)

After assigning based on who values the item more, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items. Currently, Agent 0 has 4 items, and Agent 1 has 5 items, which is a fair distribution.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
