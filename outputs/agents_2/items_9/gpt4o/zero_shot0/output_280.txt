Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  45  75   4   5  77  29   3  60
1  93  45  57  78  67  23  14  44  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that both agents get an approximately equal number of items. In this case, we have 9 items and 2 agents, so ideally each agent should receive around 4 or 5 items.

Let's calculate the total value for each item for each agent and then allocate the items to maximize each agent's valuation:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Values
Agent 0's values:
- Item 0: 99
- Item 1: 45
- Item 2: 75
- Item 3: 4
- Item 4: 5
- Item 5: 77
- Item 6: 29
- Item 7: 3
- Item 8: 60

Agent 1's values:
- Item 0: 93
- Item 1: 45
- Item 2: 57
- Item 3: 78
- Item 4: 67
- Item 5: 23
- Item 6: 14
- Item 7: 44
- Item 8: 44

### Step 2: Allocate Items Based on Highest Value
- Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 0 (99 vs 93), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1 is equally valued by both, allocate to either (let's choose Agent 0 for balance).
- Item 2 is valued higher by Agent 0 (75 vs 57), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3 is valued higher by Agent 1 (78 vs 4), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4 is valued higher by Agent 1 (67 vs 5), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5 is valued higher by Agent 0 (77 vs 23), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6 is valued higher by Agent 0 (29 vs 14), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7 is valued higher by Agent 1 (44 vs 3), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 8 is valued higher by Agent 0 (60 vs 44), allocate to Agent 0.

### Step 3: Ensure Fair Distribution
Agent 0 is currently allocated more items, so we need to adjust for fairness. We can swap one of the lower valued items from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

- Swap Item 6 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair number of items, and the allocation respects the highest valuations where possible.
