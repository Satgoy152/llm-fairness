Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  42  77  29  35  34  43  26   4
1  14  35  67  49  99  58  19   5  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider using the idea of maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One simple approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most.

Let's examine the valuations:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 27      | 14      |
| 1    | 42      | 35      |
| 2    | 77      | 67      |
| 3    | 29      | 49      |
| 4    | 35      | 99      |
| 5    | 34      | 58      |
| 6    | 43      | 19      |
| 7    | 26      | 5       |
| 8    | 4       | 83      |

Now, let's allocate each item to the agent who values it more:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (27) vs Agent 1 (14) -> Agent 0
- Item 1: Agent 0 (42) vs Agent 1 (35) -> Agent 0
- Item 2: Agent 0 (77) vs Agent 1 (67) -> Agent 0
- Item 3: Agent 0 (29) vs Agent 1 (49) -> Agent 1
- Item 4: Agent 0 (35) vs Agent 1 (99) -> Agent 1
- Item 5: Agent 0 (34) vs Agent 1 (58) -> Agent 1
- Item 6: Agent 0 (43) vs Agent 1 (19) -> Agent 0
- Item 7: Agent 0 (26) vs Agent 1 (5)  -> Agent 0
- Item 8: Agent 0 (4) vs Agent 1 (83)  -> Agent 1

Based on the above allocations, we can conclude with:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, thereby maximizing the total valuation for each agent's allocation.
