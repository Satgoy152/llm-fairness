Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  21  41  14  51  89   4  48  28
1   4  49  92  57  45  35  28  88  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a method that considers each item's value for each agent and attempts to allocate them in a way that maximizes fairness.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 46 + 21 + 41 + 14 + 51 + 89 + 4 + 48 + 28 = 342
- Agent 1's total valuation: 4 + 49 + 92 + 57 + 45 + 35 + 28 + 88 + 70 = 468

Now, let's attempt to allocate items by comparing the difference in valuations for each item and assigning the item to the agent for whom the value is relatively higher:

1. Item 0: Agent 0: 46, Agent 1: 4 (Assign to Agent 0)
2. Item 1: Agent 0: 21, Agent 1: 49 (Assign to Agent 1)
3. Item 2: Agent 0: 41, Agent 1: 92 (Assign to Agent 1)
4. Item 3: Agent 0: 14, Agent 1: 57 (Assign to Agent 1)
5. Item 4: Agent 0: 51, Agent 1: 45 (Assign to Agent 0)
6. Item 5: Agent 0: 89, Agent 1: 35 (Assign to Agent 0)
7. Item 6: Agent 0: 4, Agent 1: 28 (Assign to Agent 1)
8. Item 7: Agent 0: 48, Agent 1: 88 (Assign to Agent 1)
9. Item 8: Agent 0: 28, Agent 1: 70 (Assign to Agent 1)

This allocation aims to give each agent items for which they have relatively higher valuation compared to the other agent.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0, 4, and 5, while Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8.
