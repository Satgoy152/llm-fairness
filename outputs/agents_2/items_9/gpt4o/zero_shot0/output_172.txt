Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  73  66  96  72  67  81   4  19
1  31  11  41  79  26  77  58  95  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction or total value from the items they receive. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the valuations and allocate each item to the agent who values it more:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (31 vs 12)
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (73 vs 11)
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (66 vs 41)
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (96 vs 79)
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (72 vs 26)
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (77 vs 67)
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (81 vs 58)
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (95 vs 4)
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it more (20 vs 19)

Now, let's distribute these items evenly to ensure both agents receive a fair share of items:

Agent 0 gets: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]  
Agent 1 gets: [0, 5, 7, 8]

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
