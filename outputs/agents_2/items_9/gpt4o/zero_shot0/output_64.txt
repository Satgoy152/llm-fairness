Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  81  96  55  34  91  29  98  92
1  80  71  81  22  93  61  96  78  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the value each agent places on the items and try to allocate them accordingly:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| 0    | 4             | 80            |
| 1    | 81            | 71            |
| 2    | 96            | 81            |
| 3    | 55            | 22            |
| 4    | 34            | 93            |
| 5    | 91            | 61            |
| 6    | 29            | 96            |
| 7    | 98            | 78            |
| 8    | 92            | 48            |

Now, let's allocate the items to each agent based on the higher value they place on each item:

- Agent 0 should receive the items where their values are higher: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8.
- Agent 1 should receive the items where their values are higher: 0, 4, 6.

After examining the values, we can make the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value more, maximizing the total value for each.
