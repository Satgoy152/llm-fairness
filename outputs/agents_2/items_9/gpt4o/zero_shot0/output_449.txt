Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  23  28  62  22  37   9  67  15
1  63   2  86  64  68   1  73  75  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[77 23 28 62 22 37  9 67 15]
 [63  2 86 64 68  1 73 75 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to ensure that each agent gets a similar total valuation for the items they receive. We start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all the items.

Agent 0's valuations: 
- Total = 77 + 23 + 28 + 62 + 22 + 37 + 9 + 67 + 15 = 340

Agent 1's valuations: 
- Total = 63 + 2 + 86 + 64 + 68 + 1 + 73 + 75 + 33 = 465

Now, let's try to distribute the items in a way that balances the total valuation for each agent. One way to achieve this is to start by allocating higher-value items to the agent with the lower total valuation.

1. Allocate the highest-value item (item 2) to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it at 86. 
2. Allocate the next highest-value item (item 7) to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it at 75.
3. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it at 73.
4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it at 68.
5. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it at 64.
6. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it at 77.
7. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it at 23.
8. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it at 37.
9. Allocate item 8 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it at 15.

Let's verify the allocation:

Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Total valuation for Agent 0 = 77 + 23 + 37 + 15 = 152

Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Total valuation for Agent 1 = 86 + 64 + 68 + 73 + 75 = 366

The allocation can be represented as follows in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
