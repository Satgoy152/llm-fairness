Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  65  47  95  95  44  70  78  54
1  75  63  74  73  72  93  65  94  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while trying to balance the number of items each agent receives. We will aim to distribute the items such that both agents have as close to equal total value as possible. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items one by one, starting with the item that has the highest difference in valuations between the agents, giving the item to the agent who values it more.
3. Alternate between agents if a tie in valuation occurs or if fairness needs to be maintained in terms of the number of items.

Let's apply this logic to the given data:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 78 + 65 + 47 + 95 + 95 + 44 + 70 + 78 + 54 = 626
   - Agent 1: 75 + 63 + 74 + 73 + 72 + 93 + 65 + 94 + 66 = 675

2. Allocate items based on the highest difference in valuations:
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 values it at 73; allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 values it at 72; allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 93, Agent 0 values it at 44; allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 94, Agent 0 values it at 78; allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 74, Agent 0 values it at 47; allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 values it at 75; allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 values it at 63; allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 8: Agent 1 values it at 66, Agent 0 values it at 54; allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 values it at 65; allocate to Agent 0.

3. Resulting allocation:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3, 4, 6]
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 5, 7, 8]

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
