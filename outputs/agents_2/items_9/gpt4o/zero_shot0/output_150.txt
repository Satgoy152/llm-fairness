Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  15  28  15  54  64  64  10  10
1  64  52  89  38  75  22  16  59  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets a bundle of items that maximizes their total valuation while maintaining a balance in the number of items each agent receives. Since there are 9 items, each agent should ideally receive 4 or 5 items.

Let's calculate the total valuation for different allocations to find a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:**
   - Items 0, 5, and 6 have the highest values (73, 64, 64).

2. **Agent 1's valuations:**
   - Items 2, 4, and 8 have the highest values (89, 75, 65).

By allocating based on the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring a fair split in the number of items, we can propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- **Agent 1:** Items 2, 4, 7, 8

This allocation gives each agent 4 or 5 items and ensures that the allocation takes into account the preferences of the agents as much as possible. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 7, 8]
}
```

This distribution aims to balance the number of items and maximize the total valuation for both agents based on their preferences.
