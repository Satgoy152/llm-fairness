Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  21  92  53  10  47  15  38  26
1  76  77  87   0   3  36  27   5  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 2 with a valuation of 92 and item 3 with a valuation of 53. Agent 0 also places good value on item 0 (44) and item 5 (47).

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values items 0 (76), 1 (77), and 2 (87). However, since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, we consider other high-value items. Agent 1 also has a relatively high valuation for item 8 (57) and item 6 (27).

Considering these observations, here is a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 0, 5],
    "1": [1, 8, 6, 4, 7]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 2, 3, 0, and 5, which are among the items they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 8, 6, 4, and 7, balancing the distribution of items based on their valuations and ensuring fairness.
