Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  71  77  68  73  41  90  86  59
1  51  23  61  32   6  58  87  53  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that the number of items allocated to each agent remains an integer. A simple approach is to allocate items based on which agent values them more, thereby maximizing each agent's satisfaction.

Let's go through the items and allocate them to the agent who values them more:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 at 51. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 at 23. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 at 61. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 at 32. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 at 6. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 at 58. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 at 87. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 at 53. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 at 22. Allocate to Agent 0.

Given this allocation, all items except item 5 are allocated to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values them more. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [5]
}
```
