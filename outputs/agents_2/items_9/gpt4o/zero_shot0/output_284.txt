Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  22  12  13  17  39  82  50  38
1  68  25  77  61  25  87  98   2  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, one item at a time.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 68, and Agent 0 values it at 65. So, assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 22, and Agent 1 values it at 25. So, assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 12, and Agent 1 values it at 77. So, assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 13, and Agent 1 values it at 61. So, assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 17, and Agent 1 values it at 25. So, assign Item 4 to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 39, and Agent 1 values it at 87. So, assign Item 5 to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 82, and Agent 1 values it at 98. So, assign Item 6 to Agent 1.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 50, and Agent 1 values it at 2. So, assign Item 7 to Agent 0.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 38, and Agent 1 values it at 90. So, assign Item 8 to Agent 1.

After assigning items based on who values them the most, we check to ensure each agent receives a fair number of items. If necessary, we adjust the allocation to balance the number of items between agents.

Adjustments:
- Agent 1 has significantly more items than Agent 0. To balance the allocation, we move some items with least value to Agent 1 from Agent 0.
- Move Item 0 from Agent 1 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 7, and Agent 1 receives the rest.
