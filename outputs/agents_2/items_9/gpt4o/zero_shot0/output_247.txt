Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  54  72   4  75  20  70  71  61
1  82  99  30  33   7   9  59  97  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the agents, we can employ a strategy to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One way to approach this is through a greedy algorithm that considers the highest value per item for each agent.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0:
Item 0: 41, Item 1: 54, Item 2: 72, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 75, Item 5: 20, Item 6: 70, Item 7: 71, Item 8: 61

Agent 1:
Item 0: 82, Item 1: 99, Item 2: 30, Item 3: 33, Item 4: 7, Item 5: 9, Item 6: 59, Item 7: 97, Item 8: 47
```

To allocate the items:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most.
3. Ensure that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Following these steps:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (82 vs 41).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (99 vs 54).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (72 vs 30).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (33 vs 4).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (75 vs 7).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (20 vs 9).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (70 vs 59).
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (97 vs 71).
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (61 vs 47).

Now, let's balance the allocation to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items (since there are 9 items, one agent will receive 5 items and the other 4):

Currently, Agent 0 has 5 items (2, 4, 5, 6, 8), and Agent 1 has 4 items (0, 1, 3, 7).

This allocation is already balanced with Agent 0 receiving 5 items and Agent 1 receiving 4 items. Therefore, this allocation is fair and meets the criteria.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 7]
}
```
