Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  53  38  79  20  75  55  38  20
1  55  55  82   9  33  39   9  48  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of both agents while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of the items. This can be achieved by considering the valuations of each agent for the items.

Given the valuations, let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Prefers item 3 (79) most, then item 5 (75), item 0 (68), item 6 (55), item 1 (53), etc.
   
2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Prefers item 2 (82) most, then item 0 (55), item 1 (55), item 7 (48), item 5 (39), etc.

Let's allocate the items while trying to maximize the satisfaction of both agents:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0 (68)
  - Item 3 (79)
  - Item 5 (75)
  - Item 6 (55)
  - Item 8 (20)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 1 (55)
  - Item 2 (82)
  - Item 4 (33)
  - Item 7 (48)

This allocation ensures that both agents get a relatively fair distribution based on their preferences and the total number of items (5 for Agent 0 and 4 for Agent 1). Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 7]
}
```
