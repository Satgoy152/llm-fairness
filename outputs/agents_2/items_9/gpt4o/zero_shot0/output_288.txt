Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  92  32   9  78  76  64  93  28
1  47  66  41  20  63  65  94  93  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[13 92 32  9 78 76 64 93 28]
 [47 66 41 20 63 65 94 93 51]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if items are allocated optimally.

### Valuation Table

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 13      | 47      |
| 1    | 92      | 66      |
| 2    | 32      | 41      |
| 3    | 9       | 20      |
| 4    | 78      | 63      |
| 5    | 76      | 65      |
| 6    | 64      | 94      |
| 7    | 93      | 93      |
| 8    | 28      | 51      |

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Calculate the total value for each item for both agents.**
2. **Iteratively, assign each item to the agent who values it more, while keeping track of the total valuation each agent has.**

Let's start allocating:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it more (47 vs. 13).
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it more (92 vs. 66).
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it more (41 vs. 32).
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it more (20 vs. 9).
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it more (78 vs. 63).
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it more (76 vs. 65).
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it more (94 vs. 64).
- **Item 7**: Both value equally (93 vs. 93). Allocate to Agent 0 for balance.
- **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it more (51 vs. 28).

### Initial Allocation

- Agent 0: [1, 4, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 3, 6, 8]

### Check Balance

Now, calculate the total valuation for each agent after this allocation:

- **Agent 0 Total Valuation**: 92 + 78 + 76 + 93 = 339
- **Agent 1 Total Valuation**: 47 + 41 + 20 + 94 + 51 = 253

The allocation can be further optimized by considering possible swaps to balance the totals more closely. For simplicity, let's ensure each agent has almost similar total valuation:

### Balanced Allocation

- **Agent 0**: [1, 4, 5, 8]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 2, 3, 6, 7]

Calculate again:

- **Agent 0 Total Valuation**: 92 + 78 + 76 + 28 = 274
- **Agent 1 Total Valuation**: 47 + 41 + 20 + 94 + 93 = 295

This allocation provides a more balanced valuation between the agents.

### Final Allocation in JSON

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
