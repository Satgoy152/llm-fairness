Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  57  43   7  33  54  56  60  15
1  21  35  80  51  84  56  10  63  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. Given there are 9 items, we can allocate 4 items to one agent and 5 items to the other. Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. Calculate the total value for each item for both agents to understand which items are more valuable to each agent.
2. Allocate items to maximize the satisfaction of each agent, ensuring a fair distribution in terms of the number of items.

Let's determine the allocation:

- Agent 0 values: [28, 57, 43, 7, 33, 54, 56, 60, 15]
- Agent 1 values: [21, 35, 80, 51, 84, 56, 10, 63, 36]

We'll allocate items based on the highest value for each agent, ensuring that the number of items remains balanced.

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 84 vs 33).
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 80 vs 43).
3. Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (value 63 vs 60).
4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 56 vs 54).
5. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 51 vs 7).

Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.

Now allocate the remaining items to Agent 0:

Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 6, 8.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
