Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  68  11  71  61  26  69  20  87
1  47  45  75  61  64  27  21  51  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to balance the total value of items each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Values:** Start by calculating the total value each agent places on all items.

   - Agent 0's total value for all items: 92 + 68 + 11 + 71 + 61 + 26 + 69 + 20 + 87 = 505
   - Agent 1's total value for all items: 47 + 45 + 75 + 61 + 64 + 27 + 21 + 51 + 93 = 484

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy:** Initially, try to allocate items to the agent who values them the most while keeping an eye on balancing the total value of items each agent receives.

3. **Iterative Allocation:** Assign items iteratively based on the highest difference in valuation between the agents, and adjust to ensure the total value is balanced.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 47. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 values it at 45. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 11, Agent 1 values it at 75. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 values it at 61. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 64. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 values it at 27. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 values it at 21. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 values it at 51. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 values it at 93. Assign to Agent 1.

After allocation, the item distribution is as follows to ensure both agents have a fairly balanced total value:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 3, 6]
- Agent 1: [2, 4, 5, 7, 8]

Now, let's check the total values for each agent:

- Agent 0 total value: 92 + 68 + 71 + 69 = 300
- Agent 1 total value: 75 + 64 + 27 + 51 + 93 = 310

These totals are relatively balanced. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
