Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  57  40   7  86  13   5  68   2
1  19  40  78  54  99  28  14  60  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total value each agent receives by considering their individual valuations. We aim to allocate items such that each agent gets an equitable share based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to allocate the items optimally:

1. **Agent 0’s valuation of items**: [2, 57, 40, 7, 86, 13, 5, 68, 2]
2. **Agent 1’s valuation of items**: [19, 40, 78, 54, 99, 28, 14, 60, 86]

We will allocate the items in a way that each agent maximizes their total valuation.

- Start by comparing valuations for each item:
  - Item 0: Agent 1 values it higher (19 vs 2)
  - Item 1: Agent 0 values it higher (57 vs 40)
  - Item 2: Agent 1 values it higher (78 vs 40)
  - Item 3: Agent 1 values it higher (54 vs 7)
  - Item 4: Agent 1 values it higher (99 vs 86)
  - Item 5: Agent 1 values it higher (28 vs 13)
  - Item 6: Agent 1 values it higher (14 vs 5)
  - Item 7: Agent 0 values it higher (68 vs 60)
  - Item 8: Agent 1 values it higher (86 vs 2)

Based on these valuations, we will allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent:

- **Allocate to Agent 0**: [1, 4, 7]
  - Total value for Agent 0 = 57 + 86 + 68 = 211
- **Allocate to Agent 1**: [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8]
  - Total value for Agent 1 = 19 + 78 + 54 + 28 + 14 + 86 = 279

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their personal valuations.
