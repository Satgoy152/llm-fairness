Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  98  73  73  41  14  86  65  68
1  93  58  63  39  65  34  47  82  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [93 58 63 39 65 34 47 82 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. An effective way to achieve this is to use a method that balances the total value each agent perceives from their allocated items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all the items:

   - Agent 0: 77 + 98 + 73 + 73 + 41 + 14 + 86 + 65 + 68 = 595
   - Agent 1: 93 + 58 + 63 + 39 + 65 + 34 + 47 + 82 + 75 = 556

2. Sort the items by the difference in valuations for the two agents to prioritize allocation to the agent valuing them more significantly.

3. Allocate items to balance the total perceived value for each agent as closely as possible.

Based on the valuation differences, a fair allocation could look like this:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
  - Total valuation: 77 + 98 + 14 + 86 + 68 = 343

- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 4, 7
  - Total valuation: 63 + 39 + 65 + 82 = 249

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the total perceived value.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
