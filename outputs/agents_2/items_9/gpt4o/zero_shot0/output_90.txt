Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  69  76   7  64  21  16  38  98
1  23  98  44  63   2  61  32   0  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall happiness (value) of each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the Nash Welfare, which is the product of the utilities (valuations) of each agent for their allocated items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0 total value: 59 + 69 + 76 + 7 + 64 + 21 + 16 + 38 + 98 = 448
   - Agent 1 total value: 23 + 98 + 44 + 63 + 2 + 61 + 32 + 0 + 26 = 349

2. We need to allocate each item to one of the agents to maximize fairness. A systematic way is to alternate assignment based on the highest value for each item or by ensuring each agent gets a fair share of high-value items.

3. Allocate items based on their value to each agent:

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 59, and Agent 1 values it at 23. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 69, and Agent 1 values it at 98. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 76, and Agent 1 values it at 44. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 7, and Agent 1 values it at 63. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 64, and Agent 1 values it at 2. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 21, and Agent 1 values it at 61. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 16, and Agent 1 values it at 32. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 38, and Agent 1 values it at 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 98, and Agent 1 values it at 26. Allocate to Agent 0.

4. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of high-value items while ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
