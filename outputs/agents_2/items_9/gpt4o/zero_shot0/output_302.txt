Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  34  36  44  21   6  28  66  33
1  46  46  81  52  98  43  61  31  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One strategy is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items. We can use a method called "envy-free" allocation if possible, where neither agent would prefer the other's allocation over their own.

Let's try to allocate the items to maximize fairness:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items:
   - Agent 0: 21 + 34 + 36 + 44 + 21 + 6 + 28 + 66 + 33 = 289
   - Agent 1: 46 + 46 + 81 + 52 + 98 + 43 + 61 + 31 + 15 = 473

2. Distribute the items so that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible:
   - Sort items based on the difference in valuation between the two agents.
   - Allocate items iteratively to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Items 4, 5, and 8 go to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values them significantly more.
- Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 will be distributed to balance the total value.

After considering these factors, let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 1, 3, 7]
- Agent 1 receives items: [2, 4, 5, 6, 8]

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of the total value, with Agent 0 receiving a total value of 21 + 34 + 44 + 66 = 165 and Agent 1 receiving a total value of 81 + 98 + 43 + 61 + 15 = 298.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
