Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  54  44   4  82   9  29  20  30
1  24  44  64  92  71  36  54  48  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations such that each agent is satisfied with the distribution. A common approach is to ensure each agent receives items with a total value approximately equal to half of the total value of all items, as there are two agents.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 50 + 54 + 44 + 4 + 82 + 9 + 29 + 20 + 30 = 322
- Agent 1's total valuation: 24 + 44 + 64 + 92 + 71 + 36 + 54 + 48 + 88 = 521

Next, we'll aim for each agent to have items with approximately equal total valuation based on their preferences.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Allocate items with a higher valuation difference to the agent who values them more.
2. Ensure that the sum of valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Considering the above, here's one way to allocate the items:

- Start with items that have large valuation differences. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it much higher (92 vs 4).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as they value it slightly higher (82 vs 71).
- Continue this process for each item.

Based on this approach, a possible allocation could be:

Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7  
Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 6, 8  

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their respective valuations.
