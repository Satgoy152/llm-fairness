Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  53  18  57  70  87  93  46  69
1  73  46  64  98  48  10  59  91  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[60 53 18 57 70 87 93 46 69]
 [73 46 64 98 48 10 59 91 24]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. This involves considering the preferences and valuations of each agent for the items.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent if they were to receive all items:

- Total valuation for agent 0: 60 + 53 + 18 + 57 + 70 + 87 + 93 + 46 + 69 = 553
- Total valuation for agent 1: 73 + 46 + 64 + 98 + 48 + 10 + 59 + 91 + 24 = 513

Now, let's allocate the items in such a way that both agents receive a similar total valuation:

1. Sort items by the difference in valuations between the two agents.
2. Allocate items to balance the total valuation.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 4, 5, 8]
  - Total valuation: 60 + 18 + 70 + 87 + 69 = 304
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 6, 7]
  - Total valuation: 46 + 98 + 59 + 91 = 294

Thus, the allocation is fairly balanced in terms of total value received by each agent.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
