Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  54  26   2  71  85  50  85  88
1  95  29  97  28  26  42  21  11  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. This problem can be approached by considering the sum of valuations for each possible allocation and then comparing them to find a fair distribution.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation for different possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Total valuation if Agent 0 gets items [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8]:  
     \(46 + 54 + 26 + 71 + 50 + 88 = 335\)

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Total valuation if Agent 1 gets items [3, 5, 7]:  
     \(28 + 42 + 11 = 81\)

We can see from the above that Agent 0 has a higher valuation sum with this allocation.

Now, let's reverse some allocations to see if we can improve fairness:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Total valuation if Agent 0 gets items [0, 1, 2, 5, 7]:  
     \(46 + 54 + 26 + 85 + 85 = 296\)

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Total valuation if Agent 1 gets items [3, 4, 6, 8]:  
     \(28 + 26 + 21 + 29 = 104\)

In this allocation, Agent 1 has a higher valuation sum, but not by much.

To find a balance, let's allocate items based on the highest value each agent has for an item:

- Agent 0 has higher values for items: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6
- Agent 1 has higher values for items: 3, 5, 7, 8

Let's try another allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Total valuation if Agent 0 gets items [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]:  
     \(46 + 54 + 26 + 71 + 50 = 247\)

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Total valuation if Agent 1 gets items [3, 5, 7, 8]:  
     \(28 + 42 + 11 + 29 = 110\)

This allocation provides a more balanced distribution of the total valuation. Let's finalize this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [3, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation gives a fairly balanced division of items based on the valuations, maintaining the requirement of integer allocations to agents.
