Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  51   7  83  31  84  86  77  70
1  92  68  18  10  56  44  38  18  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. Given there are 9 items, each agent should ideally receive 4 or 5 items.

Let's evaluate the items for each agent and allocate them such that the total valuation for each agent is maximized while respecting the number constraint.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0:
  - Item values: 30, 51, 7, 83, 31, 84, 86, 77, 70
  - Total value for agent 0: 519

- Agent 1:
  - Item values: 92, 68, 18, 10, 56, 44, 38, 18, 16
  - Total value for agent 1: 360

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Identify the most valuable items for each agent.
2. Allocate these items to the agent that values them the highest.
3. Ensure each agent gets a balanced number of items (4 or 5).

### Allocation:
- Agent 0 has high values for items 3, 5, 6, 7.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 0, 1, 4.

Allocate based on the highest values:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 5, 6, 7, 8] (values: 83, 84, 86, 77, 70)
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 2, 4] (values: 92, 68, 18, 56)

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Total value = 400
- Agent 1: Total value = 234

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```
