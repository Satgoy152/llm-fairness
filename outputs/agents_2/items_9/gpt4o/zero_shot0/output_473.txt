Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  97  22  14  93  83  36  82  37
1  59  12  68  96  17  59  86  16  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that both agents receive a fair share of the total value of items based on their respective valuations. One common approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(35 + 97 + 22 + 14 + 93 + 83 + 36 + 82 + 37 = 499\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(59 + 12 + 68 + 96 + 17 + 59 + 86 + 16 + 94 = 507\)

We want to allocate the items such that the perceived value for each agent is similar.

A simple allocation can be performed by iteratively assigning items to the agent who values them most until all items are allocated. This is a greedy approach:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 59 vs. Agent 0 at 35 → Assign to Agent 1
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 97 vs. Agent 1 at 12 → Assign to Agent 0
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 68 vs. Agent 0 at 22 → Assign to Agent 1
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 96 vs. Agent 0 at 14 → Assign to Agent 1
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 93 vs. Agent 1 at 17 → Assign to Agent 0
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 83 vs. Agent 1 at 59 → Assign to Agent 0
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 86 vs. Agent 0 at 36 → Assign to Agent 1
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 82 vs. Agent 1 at 16 → Assign to Agent 0
9. Item 8: Agent 1 values it at 94 vs. Agent 0 at 37 → Assign to Agent 1

Now, we check the total values:

- Agent 0's allocation: Items [1, 4, 5, 7] with values [97, 93, 83, 82]
- Total value for Agent 0: \(97 + 93 + 83 + 82 = 355\)

- Agent 1's allocation: Items [0, 2, 3, 6, 8] with values [59, 68, 96, 86, 94]
- Total value for Agent 1: \(59 + 68 + 96 + 86 + 94 = 403\)

This allocation is reasonably fair given the constraints, as both agents receive a significant portion of their perceived total value.

The JSON format of the allocations is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6, 8]
}
```
