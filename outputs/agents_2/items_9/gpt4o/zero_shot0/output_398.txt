Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  83  68  40  33   1  37  76  93
1  57  81  37  97  69  86  71  64  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the two agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we will use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent without exceeding the number of items they can take. One approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it more. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Compare the valuations of each item for both agents.
2. Assign the item to the agent who has the higher valuation for that item.
3. Ensure that each agent ends up with an equal (or almost equal) number of items.

Given the valuations for the items, let's determine the allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 57, and Agent 0 values it at 37. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 81, and Agent 0 values it at 83. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 37, and Agent 0 values it at 68. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 97, and Agent 0 values it at 40. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 69, and Agent 0 values it at 33. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 86, and Agent 0 values it at 1. Allocate to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 71, and Agent 0 values it at 37. Allocate to Agent 1.
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 64, and Agent 0 values it at 76. Allocate to Agent 0.
9. Item 8: Agent 1 values it at 27, and Agent 0 values it at 93. Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 7, 8 (4 items total)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 4, 5, 6 (5 items total)

The allocation is fairly balanced, given the constraints of maximizing the value for each agent. Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
