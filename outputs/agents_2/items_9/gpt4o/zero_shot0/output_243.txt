Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4  5   6   7   8
0   4  99  89  81  18  4  58  25   8
1  20  30  79  58  20  7  18  77  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. A common approach is to aim for envy-free or approximately envy-free allocations. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own bundle.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items and then try to distribute the items such that the allocations are balanced in terms of value.

Agent 0's total valuation for all items:
- \(4 + 99 + 89 + 81 + 18 + 4 + 58 + 25 + 8 = 386\)

Agent 1's total valuation for all items:
- \(20 + 30 + 79 + 58 + 20 + 7 + 18 + 77 + 80 = 389\)

Now, let's allocate the items to balance the valuations as much as possible:

1. Start by giving each agent the item they value the most:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most at 99.
   - Agent 1 values item 8 the most at 80.

2. Continue allocating items by attempting to balance the remaining values.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 3, 5]
  - Valuation: \(99 + 89 + 81 + 4 = 273\)

- Agent 1: Items [0, 4, 6, 7, 8]
  - Valuation: \(20 + 20 + 18 + 77 + 80 = 215\)

These allocations leave some imbalance, so let's adjust:

- Reassign item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

Adjusted allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 5, 6]
  - Valuation: \(99 + 89 + 4 + 58 = 250\)

- Agent 1: Items [0, 3, 4, 7, 8]
  - Valuation: \(20 + 58 + 20 + 77 + 80 = 255\)

This allocation is closer in terms of total valuation for each agent.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
