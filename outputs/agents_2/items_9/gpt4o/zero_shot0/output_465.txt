Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  86  78  45  51  60  57  85  70
1  45  43  55  90  42  52  74   3   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we will use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's the table of valuations for clarity:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 76      | 45      |
| 1    | 86      | 43      |
| 2    | 78      | 55      |
| 3    | 45      | 90      |
| 4    | 51      | 42      |
| 5    | 60      | 52      |
| 6    | 57      | 74      |
| 7    | 85      | 3       |
| 8    | 70      | 9       |

To achieve a fair allocation, we'll start by considering the items that have a significantly higher valuation for one agent over the other, and then balance the remaining items.

1. Assign items to the agent who values them significantly more:
   - Agent 0 has significantly higher values for items 0, 1, 2, 7, 8.
   - Agent 1 has significantly higher values for items 3, 6.

2. Distribute remaining items to balance allocations:
   - Items 4 and 5 have closer valuations, but Agent 0 values 5 slightly higher and Agent 1 values 4 slightly higher.

Based on this analysis, the allocation could be as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: [3, 4, 6]

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while considering their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
