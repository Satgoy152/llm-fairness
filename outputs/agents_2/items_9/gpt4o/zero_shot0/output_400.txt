Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  58  34  53  36  39  77  28  10
1  15   8  11  19   9  38  54  42  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by giving each item to the agent who values it more, while ensuring that both agents receive a fair number of items. Given that there are 9 items, we can allocate 4 items to one agent and 5 items to the other. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items by the absolute difference in valuations in descending order. This way, we prioritize items that have the most significant difference in valuation between the two agents.
3. Allocate items to the agent with the higher valuation for each item, considering the constraint of total items per agent.
4. Ensure that each agent receives at least 4 items and no more than 5 items.

Let's apply this approach to the data:

- Valuation differences (Agent 0 - Agent 1):
  - Item 0: 87 - 15 = 72
  - Item 1: 58 - 8 = 50
  - Item 2: 34 - 11 = 23
  - Item 3: 53 - 19 = 34
  - Item 4: 36 - 9 = 27
  - Item 5: 39 - 38 = 1
  - Item 6: 77 - 54 = 23
  - Item 7: 28 - 42 = -14
  - Item 8: 10 - 20 = -10

- Sort items by absolute difference:
  - Item 0 (72), Item 1 (50), Item 3 (34), Item 4 (27), Item 2 (23), Item 6 (23), Item 7 (14), Item 8 (10), Item 5 (1)

- Initial allocation based on higher valuation:
  - Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
  - Agent 1: Items 5, 7, 8

- Adjust to ensure fair distribution:
  - Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3, 6, 4 (5 items)
  - Agent 1: Items 2, 5, 7, 8 (4 items)

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 6, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
