Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  35  23  59  67  97  16  70  89
1  12  79  64  12  91  44  46  52  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll aim for a balanced distribution of total value between the agents.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to each item and then attempt a fair distribution of these items:

1. **Total Values**: 
   - Agent 0's total value for all items: 534
   - Agent 1's total value for all items: 420

2. **Allocation Strategy**: 
   We aim to distribute items such that the total value perceived by both agents is as equal as possible.

3. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Allocate items with higher value to the agent who values them more.
   - Adjust allocations to balance total perceived value.

Now, let's perform the allocation:

**Agent 0** values:
- Items with highest values: 5 (97), 8 (89), 0 (78), 7 (70)

**Agent 1** values:
- Items with highest values: 4 (91), 1 (79), 2 (64)

**Balanced Allocation**: 
- Agent 0: [0, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]

**Check Values**:
- Agent 0 gets items: 0 (78), 5 (97), 7 (70)
  - Total value: 78 + 97 + 70 = 245
- Agent 1 gets items: 1 (79), 2 (64), 3 (12), 4 (91), 6 (46), 8 (20)
  - Total value: 79 + 64 + 12 + 91 + 46 + 20 = 312

This allocation now seems unbalanced in terms of the perceived total value. Let's try to adjust.

**Revised Allocation**:
- Agent 0: [0, 3, 5, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 4, 6]

**Revised Check Values**:
- Agent 0 gets items: 0 (78), 3 (59), 5 (97), 7 (70), 8 (89)
  - Total value: 78 + 59 + 97 + 70 + 89 = 393
- Agent 1 gets items: 1 (79), 2 (64), 4 (91), 6 (46)
  - Total value: 79 + 64 + 91 + 46 = 280

This allocation is more balanced considering that Agent 0 has a higher total value of items overall.

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
