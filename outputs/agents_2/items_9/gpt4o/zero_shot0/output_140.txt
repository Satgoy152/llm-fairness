Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  71   2  11  72  99  68  60  80
1  34  97  87  54  73  18  76  12  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent. One common approach is to use the "greedy" method, where we assign each item to the agent who values it more, and ensure that the total number of items is balanced between the two agents.

Let's evaluate the potential allocation:

- Compare the valuations of each item:
  - Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (34 vs. 8).
  - Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (97 vs. 71).
  - Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (87 vs. 2).
  - Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (54 vs. 11).
  - Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (72 vs. 73).
  - Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (99 vs. 18).
  - Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (68 vs. 76).
  - Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (60 vs. 12).
  - Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (80 vs. 58).

To balance the allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items with indices: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (6 items).
- Agent 1 gets items with indices: 1, 2, 3 (3 items).

Since this allocation is not balanced, we can reassign one item from Agent 0 to Agent 1 to achieve a more balanced distribution. We can shift the item with the smallest difference in preference where Agent 0 has more items. Let's look at the smallest value difference:

- Item 8 (80 vs. 58): Difference is 22.

Reassign Item 8 to Agent 1:

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 5, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8]

This ensures a fair allocation while trying to maximize the overall value each agent receives. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 8]
}
```
