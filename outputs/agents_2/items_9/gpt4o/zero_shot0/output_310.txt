Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  47  93  57  20  76   3  90  11
1  33  59  94  17  10  39  11  37  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to balance the total value each agent receives. We'll aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [82, 47, 93, 57, 20, 76, 3, 90, 11]
- Agent 1: [33, 59, 94, 17, 10, 39, 11, 37, 46]

A good approach could be to use a simple algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while keeping track of the number of items each agent receives to ensure an integer number of items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Compare the valuations for each item and allocate it to the agent with the higher valuation.
2. If both agents value an item equally, we can use a tie-breaking rule such as randomly assigning the item or assigning it to the agent with fewer items so far.

Following these steps, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (82 > 33)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (59 > 47)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (94 > 93)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (57 > 17)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (20 > 10)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (76 > 39)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (11 > 3)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (90 > 37)
- Item 8: Agent 1 (46 > 11)

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 4, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 6, 8]

This allocation ensures each agent has an integer number of items and aims to balance their perceived value.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 6, 8]
}
```
