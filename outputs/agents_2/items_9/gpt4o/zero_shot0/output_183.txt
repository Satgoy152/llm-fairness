Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  98  93  68  59  46  11  65  86
1   1  15  34  44  31  95  26  24  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 1 15 34 44 31 95 26 24 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize their respective valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can do this by comparing the valuations of each item for both agents and assigning the item to the agent who values it more. 

Let's go through the items one by one:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 97.
   - Agent 1 values it at 1.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 98.
   - Agent 1 values it at 15.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 93.
   - Agent 1 values it at 34.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 68.
   - Agent 1 values it at 44.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 59.
   - Agent 1 values it at 31.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 46.
   - Agent 1 values it at 95.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

7. **Item 6:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 11.
   - Agent 1 values it at 26.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

8. **Item 7:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 65.
   - Agent 1 values it at 24.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

9. **Item 8:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 86.
   - Agent 1 values it at 34.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, we can present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [5, 6]
}
```
