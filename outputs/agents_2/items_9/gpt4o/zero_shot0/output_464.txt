Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  19  52  72  64  51  85  37  91
1  73   4  67  33  56  33  16  29  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. One approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm to allocate items. We can iterate over each item and assign it to the agent who values it more, while ensuring that the number of items each agent receives remains balanced. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total number of items each agent should receive. With 9 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally receive 4 or 5 items.
2. Allocate items by assigning each item to the agent who values it more until each agent has approximately the same number of items.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (73 vs 23), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (19 vs 4), assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (67 vs 52), assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (72 vs 33), assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (64 vs 56), assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (51 vs 33), assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (85 vs 16), assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (37 vs 29), but Agent 1 needs more items, assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (91 vs 28), but Agent 1 needs more items, assign to Agent 1.

After allocation, Agent 0 has 5 items and Agent 1 has 4 items, which is a fair distribution given the total number of items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 7, 8]
}
```
