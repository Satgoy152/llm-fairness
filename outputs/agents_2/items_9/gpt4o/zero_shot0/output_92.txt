Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79   9  87  78  80  38  30   2  12
1  53  41  46  18  24  82  42  23  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to balance the total valuations each agent receives. Let's break down the task:

First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 values: 79, 9, 87, 78, 80, 38, 30, 2, 12
- Agent 1 values: 53, 41, 46, 18, 24, 82, 42, 23, 26

Total value for Agent 0: 79 + 9 + 87 + 78 + 80 + 38 + 30 + 2 + 12 = 415
Total value for Agent 1: 53 + 41 + 46 + 18 + 24 + 82 + 42 + 23 + 26 = 355

We aim to partition these items so that both agents have approximately equal total valuations.

Let's attempt an allocation:

1. Start by allocating the highest value items for each agent, ensuring the total valuation is balanced.
2. Adjust allocations to equalize total valuations.

Proposed allocation:

- Give Agent 0 items they value highly: [0, 2, 3, 4]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 79 (item 0) + 87 (item 2) + 78 (item 3) + 80 (item 4) = 324

- Assign remaining items to Agent 1: [1, 5, 6, 7, 8]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 41 (item 1) + 82 (item 5) + 42 (item 6) + 23 (item 7) + 26 (item 8) = 214

Re-evaluate and adjust to balance:

- Reassign item 1 to Agent 0, and item 0 to Agent 1:
  - Agent 0 now has: [2, 3, 4, 1]
    - Total value for Agent 0: 87 + 78 + 80 + 9 = 254
  - Agent 1 now has: [0, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    - Total value for Agent 1: 53 + 82 + 42 + 23 + 26 = 226

Further adjustment is needed:

- Swap item 3 and item 0:
  - Agent 0: [2, 4, 1, 0]
    - Total value for Agent 0: 87 + 80 + 9 + 79 = 255
  - Agent 1: [3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    - Total value for Agent 1: 78 + 82 + 42 + 23 + 26 = 251

This allocation is reasonably balanced:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 1, 0],
    "1": [3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations of the items each agent receives.
