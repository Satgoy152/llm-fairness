Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  89  75   4  45  58  23  93  31
1  80  87  31  34  65   0  91  47  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an approach that balances the total valuation each agent receives. We will aim to distribute the items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's walk through the allocation process:

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - We have two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1) and nine items (0 through 8).

2. **Valuations**:
   - Agent 0's valuations: [71, 89, 75, 4, 45, 58, 23, 93, 31]
   - Agent 1's valuations: [80, 87, 31, 34, 65, 0, 91, 47, 92]

3. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Consider the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
   - Assign each item to the agent that values it more, while trying to balance the total valuation between the two agents.

4. **Allocation Process**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (80 vs. 71) → Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (89 vs. 87) → Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (75 vs. 31) → Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (34 vs. 4) → Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (65 vs. 45) → Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (58 vs. 0) → Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (91 vs. 23) → Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (93 vs. 47) → Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 8: Agent 1 values it more (92 vs. 31) → Assign to Agent 1

5. **Resulting Allocations**:
   - Agent 0 receives items: 1, 2, 5, 7
   - Agent 1 receives items: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8

6. **JSON Format**:
   ```json
   {
       "0": [1, 2, 5, 7],
       "1": [0, 3, 4, 6, 8]
   }
   ```

These allocations attempt to balance the total valuations received by each agent, considering their preferences for each item.
