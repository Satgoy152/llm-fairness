Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  50  48  77  87  54  58  36  39
1  34  45  71  77  22   3   3   4  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, considering their individual valuations for each item. One approach is to use a fair division method that attempts to balance the total value across agents.

Let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 84 + 50 + 48 + 77 + 87 + 54 + 58 + 36 + 39 = 533
- Total value for Agent 1: 34 + 45 + 71 + 77 + 22 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 56 = 315

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize fairness in terms of each agent's valuation:

1. Allocate items to Agent 0 that they value significantly higher than Agent 1, and vice versa.
2. Aim for a balance in the number of items each agent receives.

After analyzing the values, a fair allocation might look like this:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 7, 8

Let's check the total value for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0: 84 (item 0) + 50 (item 1) + 87 (item 4) + 54 (item 5) + 58 (item 6) = 333
- Agent 1: 71 (item 2) + 77 (item 3) + 4 (item 7) + 56 (item 8) = 208

This allocation aims to maximize the valuation for each agent while distributing the items fairly. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 7, 8]
}
```
