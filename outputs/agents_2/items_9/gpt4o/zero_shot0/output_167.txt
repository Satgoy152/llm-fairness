Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  67  49  66  85  22  45  71  99
1  20  61  38  87  73  11  59  66  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we can use a strategy to balance the total values received by each agent.

Let's evaluate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 76 + 67 + 49 + 66 + 85 + 22 + 45 + 71 + 99 = 580
- Agent 1: 20 + 61 + 38 + 87 + 73 + 11 + 59 + 66 + 55 = 470

The goal is to distribute the items so that the sum of values for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. Assign items to agents based on which agent values them more, while trying to balance the total value:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (76 vs 20).
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (67 vs 61).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (49 vs 38).
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (87 vs 66).
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (85 vs 73).
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (22 vs 11).
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (59 vs 45).
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (71 vs 66).
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (99 vs 55).

2. Verify if this allocation is fair and balanced:
   - Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 with total value = 76 + 67 + 49 + 85 + 22 + 71 + 99 = 469.
   - Agent 1 receives items: 3, 6 with total value = 87 + 59 = 146.

This allocation is not balanced because Agent 1 receives significantly less value. To balance it, let's try redistributing some items:

Re-distributing:
- Give item 1 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it almost equally).
- Give item 5 to Agent 1 (low value for both, might help balance).

Re-calculating:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8 with total value = 76 + 49 + 85 + 71 + 99 = 380.
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 5, 6 with total value = 61 + 87 + 11 + 59 = 218.

This allocation is more balanced:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value received by each agent while assigning each item to the agent who values it more when possible.
