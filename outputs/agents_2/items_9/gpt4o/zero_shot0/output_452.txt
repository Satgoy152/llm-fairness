Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  58  97  53  31  57   5  65  81
1  61  98  62  59  20  31  17  46   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a strategy that aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives. We will calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation and try to balance them.

Here are the steps I followed to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Distribute items to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's calculate and allocate:

- **Agent 0** valuations: 14, 58, 97, 53, 31, 57, 5, 65, 81
- **Agent 1** valuations: 61, 98, 62, 59, 20, 31, 17, 46, 5

First, calculate the total valuation each agent would have if they received all items:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 14 + 58 + 97 + 53 + 31 + 57 + 5 + 65 + 81 = 461
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 61 + 98 + 62 + 59 + 20 + 31 + 17 + 46 + 5 = 399

Now, let's allocate the items to balance the total valuations:

1. Allocate items with the highest disparity in valuation to the agent with the higher valuation for those items.
2. Continue allocating items while maintaining a balanced total valuation.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Allocate items 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7 to Agent 1.
- Allocate items 1, 2, 4, and 8 to Agent 0.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 8],
    "1": [0, 3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
