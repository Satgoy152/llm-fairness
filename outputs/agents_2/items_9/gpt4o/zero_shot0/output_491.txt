Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  61  54  13  89  38  90  29   7
1  17  64  19  40  51  78  51  87  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the total value each agent places on the items and aim to balance these as closely as possible. Each agent should ideally receive items such that the total value of the items is as even as possible between them. 

Here's a step-by-step method for allocating the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items:
   - Agent 0's total value: 8 + 61 + 54 + 13 + 89 + 38 + 90 + 29 + 7 = 389
   - Agent 1's total value: 17 + 64 + 19 + 40 + 51 + 78 + 51 + 87 + 67 = 474

2. Allocate items to balance the value as much as possible. We can do this by trying to alternate picks based on which agent has the higher value for each item and checking the cumulative value.

3. Start allocating:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (17 vs. 8), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (64 vs. 61), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (54 vs. 19), allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (40 vs. 13), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (89 vs. 51), allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (78 vs. 38), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (90 vs. 51), allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (87 vs. 29), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 8: Agent 1 values it more (67 vs. 7), allocate to Agent 1.

By following this allocation, we end up with:

- Agent 0 gets items 2, 4, and 6, which gives them a total value of 54 + 89 + 90 = 233.
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8, which gives them a total value of 17 + 64 + 40 + 78 + 87 + 67 = 353.

Hereâ€™s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total values each agent receives, though it's not perfectly balanced due to the constraints of integer allocations and differing item values.
