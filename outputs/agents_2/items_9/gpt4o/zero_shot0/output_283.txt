Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  83  21  27  59  40  90  35  29
1  75  12  85  11  98  41  59  21  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that both agents receive a similar number of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items based on the difference in their valuations between the two agents.

Let's compute the difference in valuations for each item and sort the items based on this difference. Then we can allocate items alternately to each agent, starting with the agent who values the item more.

Here are the steps and the final allocations:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 values it at 75. Difference = 3
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 83, Agent 1 values it at 12. Difference = 71
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 values it at 85. Difference = -64
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 27, Agent 1 values it at 11. Difference = 16
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 values it at 98. Difference = -39
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 values it at 41. Difference = -1
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 values it at 59. Difference = 31
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 values it at 21. Difference = 14
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 29, Agent 1 values it at 91. Difference = -62

2. Sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuations:
   - Item 1 (71), Item 2 (64), Item 8 (62), Item 4 (39), Item 6 (31), Item 3 (16), Item 7 (14), Item 0 (3), Item 5 (1)

3. Allocate items starting with the agent who values the item more, and alternate:
   - Agent 0: Item 1, Item 0, Item 3, Item 6
   - Agent 1: Item 2, Item 8, Item 4, Item 5, Item 7

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 8, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
