Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  74  89  58  73   8  82  14  22
1  37  39  55  81  61  17  84  16   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their allocation. One common approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. 

Let's calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation and aim to balance the distribution so each agent is as satisfied as possible. We can do this by comparing the total valuation of each agent's allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for All Items:**

   - Agent 0's valuations: 52, 74, 89, 58, 73, 8, 82, 14, 22
   - Agent 1's valuations: 37, 39, 55, 81, 61, 17, 84, 16, 9

2. **Allocate Items:**

   - Assign items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring both agents get close to half of the total items (4 or 5 items each).

3. **Allocation Strategy:**

   - Sort items by the difference in valuation between Agent 0 and Agent 1: 
     - If Agent 0 values an item significantly more than Agent 1, allocate to Agent 0, and vice versa.
   - Balance the number of items each agent receives.

4. **Final Allocation:**

   - After considering valuation differences and balancing the number of items, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation considers both the number of items and the total valuation each agent receives, aiming to balance satisfaction.
