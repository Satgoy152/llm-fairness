Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  12  73  75   6  50   6  12  16
1  77  78  58   9  24  75  48  71  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[59 12 73 75  6 50  6 12 16]
 [77 78 58  9 24 75 48 71 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple method: assign each item to the agent who values it more. This method ensures that each agent gets items they value more than the other agent, maximizing satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Let's compare the valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 at 77. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 at 78. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 at 58. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 at 9. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 at 24. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 at 75. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 at 48. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 at 71. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 16, Agent 1 at 57. Assign to Agent 1.

Based on this allocation:

Agent 0 receives items: 2, 3
Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
