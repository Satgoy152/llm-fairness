Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  12  32   9   7   6  23   8  35
1  71  31  90  64  31  24  48  14  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: Sum the values for each agent across all items to understand how each agent values the items.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This method ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who gets the most value from it.

3. **Check Fairness**: After the initial allocation, ensure that both agents have a roughly equal number of items. If not, we may need to adjust the allocation for balance.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Valuation Matrix**:
   ```
   Agent 0 Valuations: [23, 12, 32, 9, 7, 6, 23, 8, 35]
   Agent 1 Valuations: [71, 31, 90, 64, 31, 24, 48, 14, 24]
   ```

2. **Greedy Allocation**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (71 vs 23)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (31 vs 12)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (90 vs 32)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (64 vs 9)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (31 vs 7)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (24 vs 6)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (48 vs 23)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (8 vs 14)
   - Item 8: Agent 0 (35 vs 24)

3. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [7, 8]
   - Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

4. **Balance Check and Adjustment**:
   - Agent 0 has 2 items, and Agent 1 has 7 items.
   - To balance, we can shift some items from Agent 1 to Agent 0 to ensure a more balanced distribution.

5. **Final Allocation**: After adjusting to balance the number of items, we can distribute them as follows:
   - Agent 0: [2, 6, 7, 8]
   - Agent 1: [0, 1, 3, 4, 5]

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and attempts to balance the number of items each agent gets.
