Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  37   5  67  13  43  23  41  76
1  42  60  13   4  58  51  13  84  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we can use a greedy approach to allocate items based on the highest value difference between the two agents.

First, let's calculate the value differences for each item between Agent 0 and Agent 1:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 values it at 42. Difference = 42 - 14 = 28
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 values it at 60. Difference = 60 - 37 = 23
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 values it at 13. Difference = 13 - 5 = 8
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 67, Agent 1 values it at 4. Difference = 67 - 4 = 63
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 values it at 58. Difference = 58 - 13 = 45
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 values it at 51. Difference = 51 - 43 = 8
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 23, Agent 1 values it at 13. Difference = 23 - 13 = 10
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 values it at 84. Difference = 84 - 41 = 43
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 values it at 21. Difference = 76 - 21 = 55

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. Allocate items with the highest positive differences to Agent 0.
2. Allocate items with the highest negative differences (or lowest positive differences) to Agent 1.

Following this rule, we have:

- Items allocated to Agent 0: 3, 8, 7, 6
- Items allocated to Agent 1: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5

Finally, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8, 7, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
