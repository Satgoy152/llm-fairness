Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1  2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  14  6   0  98  37  46  91  28
1  31  26  1  30  92  37  44  97  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent and try to balance the total values each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items combined.

   - For agent 0: \(47 + 14 + 6 + 0 + 98 + 37 + 46 + 91 + 28 = 367\)
   - For agent 1: \(31 + 26 + 1 + 30 + 92 + 37 + 44 + 97 + 28 = 386\)

2. Allocate items one by one to balance the total value each agent receives. The goal is to have the total value of items allocated to each agent be as close as possible.

3. Start by considering the highest value for each item between the two agents, and allocate it to the agent who values it more, unless it significantly skews the balance.

4. Adjust if necessary to ensure both agents receive an integer number of items and the allocation is as fair as possible.

Allocating the items:

- Agent 0 values item 4 very highly (98), so allocate it to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 7 highly (97), so allocate it to agent 1.
- Allocate item 0 to agent 0 (47 vs. 31).
- Allocate item 1 to agent 1 (26 vs. 14).
- Allocate item 2 to agent 0 (6 vs. 1).
- Allocate item 5 to agent 1 (37 vs. 37, tie breaker).
- Allocate item 6 to agent 0 (46 vs. 44).
- Allocate item 3 to agent 1 (30 vs. 0).
- Allocate item 8 to agent 1 (28 vs. 28, tie breaker).

After this allocation, the total value for each agent is:

- Agent 0: \(47 + 98 + 6 + 46 = 197\)
- Agent 1: \(31 + 26 + 37 + 30 + 44 + 97 + 28 = 293\)

This allocation aims to be fair based on the values each agent assigns to the items, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
