Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  71  92  21  29  78  92  83  96
1   7  14  99  11  38   2  81  76  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 14 99 11 38  2 81 76 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives the same number of items. Since there are 9 items, each agent will receive 4 or 5 items.

Let's evaluate a potential allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item:**

   Agent 0 valuations: [61, 71, 92, 21, 29, 78, 92, 83, 96]  
   Agent 1 valuations: [7, 14, 99, 11, 38, 2, 81, 76, 33]

2. **Determine High-Value Items for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0's highest value items: [8 (96), 2 (92), 6 (92), 7 (83), 5 (78)]
   - Agent 1's highest value items: [2 (99), 6 (81), 7 (76), 4 (38), 8 (33)]

3. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuations:**

   - Agent 0: [8, 2, 6, 7]
   - Agent 1: [0, 1, 3, 4, 5]

4. **Ensure Fair Allocation:**

   In this case, each agent receives a fair share, and the allocation attempts to optimize each agent's total valuation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 2, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair distribution based on their valuations.
