Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  89  67  41  74   6  33  41  88
1  87   3  75  22  92  37  66  30  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives a similar total value from the items they are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a balanced allocation:

1. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 94 + 89 + 67 + 41 + 74 + 6 + 33 + 41 + 88 = 533
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 87 + 3 + 75 + 22 + 92 + 37 + 66 + 30 + 36 = 448

2. **Allocate items to balance the valuation**:
   - Start by allocating items that significantly favor one agent over the other to balance the total value each agent receives.

3. **Balanced allocation of items**:
   - Let's allocate items considering their valuations, aiming for a balance in total value received by each agent.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Allocate items 0, 2, 6, 7, and 8 to Agent 0.
- Allocate items 1, 3, 4, and 5 to Agent 1.

**Allocation in JSON format**:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation received by each agent. Agent 0 receives higher-valued items based on their initial high total valuation, while Agent 1 receives items that contribute to an overall balance in total value distribution.
