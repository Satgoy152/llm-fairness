Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4  5   6   7   8
0  32  44  70  46  60  2  69   0  32
1  77  85  22   2   2  7  34  74  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by both agents and try to reach an allocation where each agent gets a roughly equal total value. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuations for each agent across all items.

   - Agent 0's total valuation: 32 + 44 + 70 + 46 + 60 + 2 + 69 + 0 + 32 = 355
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 77 + 85 + 22 + 2 + 2 + 7 + 34 + 74 + 66 = 369

2. Aim to split the total values approximately equally, which is around 362.

3. Allocate the items one by one, trying to keep the running total value for each agent as balanced as possible, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more, so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more, so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more, so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more, so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more, so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it more, so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more, so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it more, so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it more, but to balance the total values, allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's calculate the total value for each agent after this allocation:

- Agent 0's allocated items: [2, 3, 4, 6, 8]
  - Total value: 70 + 46 + 60 + 69 + 32 = 277

- Agent 1's allocated items: [0, 1, 5, 7]
  - Total value: 77 + 85 + 7 + 74 = 243

This allocation is not balanced. Let's adjust by swapping a few items to balance the values:

- Swap item 0 to Agent 0 and item 8 to Agent 1:

After swapping:

- Agent 0's allocated items: [2, 3, 4, 6, 0]
  - Total value: 70 + 46 + 60 + 69 + 32 = 277

- Agent 1's allocated items: [1, 5, 7, 8]
  - Total value: 85 + 7 + 74 + 66 = 232

This allocation is still not balanced. Let's try this allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 3, 4, 6, 8]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 5, 7]

Now, let's present the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 7]
}
```
