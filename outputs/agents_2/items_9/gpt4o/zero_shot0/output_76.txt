Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  73  61  26  66  69  55  29  76
1  38  54  34  91  77  63  29  97  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use an algorithm such as the "maximum sum allocation," where the goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items. Here, we will try to balance the total value assigned to each agent. 

Let's calculate the total value each agent perceives for all items:

- Agent 0: 72 + 73 + 61 + 26 + 66 + 69 + 55 + 29 + 76 = 527
- Agent 1: 38 + 54 + 34 + 91 + 77 + 63 + 29 + 97 + 28 = 511

Now, let's allocate the items to balance the total value received by each agent as closely as possible:

We'll start by assigning high-value items to each agent based on their individual valuations, while keeping track of the total value each agent receives.

1. Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (value 97 for Agent 1, highest value).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 91 for Agent 1, high value).
3. Allocate item 8 to Agent 0 (value 76 for Agent 0, high value).
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 72 for Agent 0, high value).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 77 for Agent 1, high value).
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value 69 for Agent 0, high value).
7. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 73 for Agent 0).
8. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value 55 for Agent 0).
9. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 34 for Agent 1).

After allocating these items, let's check the total values:

- Agent 0: 76 + 72 + 69 + 73 + 55 = 345
- Agent 1: 97 + 91 + 77 + 34 = 299

To balance the allocations further, we can adjust the distribution:

Re-allocate item 1 to Agent 1:

- Agent 0: 76 + 72 + 69 + 55 = 272
- Agent 1: 97 + 91 + 77 + 34 + 73 = 372

Re-adjust by moving item 4 to Agent 0:

- Agent 0: 76 + 72 + 69 + 55 + 77 = 349
- Agent 1: 97 + 91 + 34 + 73 = 295

Finally, let's present the fair allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the total values each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
