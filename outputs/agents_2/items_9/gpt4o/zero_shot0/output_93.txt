Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4  5   6   7   8
0  64  43  40  59  49  7  35  24  12
1  52  95  45  70  12  9  13  65  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy method, where we iteratively assign items to the agent that values them the most, but with a consideration for balance.

Let's consider the allocation step by step:

1. Start by creating a list of all items, each associated with the difference in valuation between the two agents.
2. Sort this list based on the absolute difference in valuations, from largest to smallest. This helps us allocate items that have a strong preference from one agent over the other first.
3. Allocate items one by one, trying to keep the number of items as balanced as possible between the two agents.

Following this method, here is the allocation:

- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 95, while Agent 0 values it at 43. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 64, while Agent 1 values it at 52. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 70, while Agent 0 values it at 59. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it at 70, while Agent 0 values it at 12. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 45, while Agent 0 values it at 40. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 65, while Agent 0 values it at 24. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 49, while Agent 1 values it at 12. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 35, while Agent 1 values it at 13. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 7, while Agent 1 values it at 9. Allocate to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

Here, Agent 0 receives items that have a higher valuation for them relative to Agent 1, and vice versa, with an attempt to balance the number of items each receives.
