Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  34  55   0  10   6   8  86  66
1   5  31  96  45  56  93  81  74  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 5 31 96 45 56 93 81 74 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation for all items: 59 + 34 + 55 + 0 + 10 + 6 + 8 + 86 + 66 = 324
- Agent 1's total valuation for all items: 5 + 31 + 96 + 45 + 56 + 93 + 81 + 74 + 56 = 537

We want to allocate the items such that the total value perceived by each agent is maximized, and the distribution is as fair as possible.

Let's perform the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Assign items that Agent 0 values significantly higher than Agent 1.
   - Items: 0 (59 vs 5), 7 (86 vs 74)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign items that Agent 1 values significantly higher than Agent 0.
   - Items: 2 (96 vs 55), 5 (93 vs 6)

3. **Remaining items**:
   - Item 1: Valued higher by Agent 0 (34 vs 31), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Valued only by Agent 1, assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Valued higher by Agent 1 (56 vs 10), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 6: Valued higher by Agent 1 (81 vs 8), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 8: Valued higher by Agent 0 (66 vs 56), assign to Agent 0.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
