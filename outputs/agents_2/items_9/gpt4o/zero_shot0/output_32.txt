Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  35  70   3  68  69  40  29  44
1   9  32  88  69  33  98  96  64  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 9 32 88 69 33 98 96 64 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring both agents receive an integer number of items. Let's consider an approach that balances the total value received by each agent.

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0's total value: 52 + 35 + 70 + 3 + 68 + 69 + 40 + 29 + 44 = 410
   - Agent 1's total value: 9 + 32 + 88 + 69 + 33 + 98 + 96 + 64 + 90 = 579

2. Sort the items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents:
   - Item 0: 52 (Agent 0) vs 9 (Agent 1) → Difference: 43 (favoring Agent 0)
   - Item 1: 35 vs 32 → Difference: 3 (favoring Agent 0)
   - Item 2: 70 vs 88 → Difference: -18 (favoring Agent 1)
   - Item 3: 3 vs 69 → Difference: -66 (favoring Agent 1)
   - Item 4: 68 vs 33 → Difference: 35 (favoring Agent 0)
   - Item 5: 69 vs 98 → Difference: -29 (favoring Agent 1)
   - Item 6: 40 vs 96 → Difference: -56 (favoring Agent 1)
   - Item 7: 29 vs 64 → Difference: -35 (favoring Agent 1)
   - Item 8: 44 vs 90 → Difference: -46 (favoring Agent 1)

3. Allocate items to each agent, attempting to balance the total value each receives:

   - Assign items favoring Agent 0: 0, 1, 4
   - Assign items favoring Agent 1: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8

4. Check the valuation balance:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 4 → Total value: 52 + 35 + 68 = 155
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 → Total value: 88 + 69 + 98 + 96 + 64 + 90 = 505

5. Adjust if necessary, but given the constraints and differences, this allocation is reasonable.

Final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
