Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6   7   8
0  32  30   9  96  44  77  0  41  62
1   5  31  92  30  11  19  3  69  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use an algorithm that attempts to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One of the straightforward approaches is the "greedy" method, where we allocate items based on the highest value to the agent that values it more.

Let's evaluate the allocation process step by step:

1. **Agent 0's values:** 32, 30, 9, 96, 44, 77, 0, 41, 62
2. **Agent 1's values:** 5, 31, 92, 30, 11, 19, 3, 69, 56

We'll look at each item and allocate it to the agent who values it more.

- **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 values it at 5. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 30, Agent 1 values it at 31. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 values it at 92. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 values it at 30. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 44, Agent 1 values it at 11. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 values it at 19. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 6:** Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 values it at 3. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 values it at 69. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 8:** Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 values it at 56. Allocate to Agent 0.

After allocating all the items, we have the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 6, 7]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, 4, 5, and 8.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 6, and 7.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations.
