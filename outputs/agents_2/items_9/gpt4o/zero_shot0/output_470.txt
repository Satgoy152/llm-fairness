Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  39  42  32  76  84  86  69  45
1  78   2   5  54  61  23  22  48  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent would have if they received all the items:

- Agent 0: 75 + 39 + 42 + 32 + 76 + 84 + 86 + 69 + 45 = 548
- Agent 1: 78 + 2 + 5 + 54 + 61 + 23 + 22 + 48 + 70 = 363

The total valuation across all items is 548 + 363 = 911. Ideally, each agent should have about 911 / 2 = 455.5 in total valuation.

We will try to allocate items in a way that gets each agent as close to this target as possible.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0** seems to value items more than Agent 1 in general, so we should try to allocate high-value items from Agent 0's perspective to Agent 1 if Agent 1 also values them reasonably.

2. **Agent 1** should receive items that they value highly, but we can also try to balance with items that Agent 0 values less.

### Allocating the Items

Let's start with the highest-value items for each agent and try to balance the allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 6, 5, 4. We should consider giving some of these to Agent 1 if Agent 1 values them decently.

2. **Agent 1** values item 8 highly. We should allocate it to Agent 1.

#### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 1**: Items 6, 8, 5
- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7

### Valuation Check

- **Agent 1 Valuation**: 22 (6) + 70 (8) + 23 (5) = 115
- **Agent 0 Valuation**: 86 (6) + 45 (8) + 84 (5) = 215

Now, let's check the remaining items:

- **Agent 0** total valuation: 75 (0) + 39 (1) + 42 (2) + 32 (3) + 76 (4) + 69 (7) = 333
- **Agent 1** total valuation: 2 (1) + 5 (2) + 54 (3) + 61 (4) + 48 (7) = 170

Adding the initial allocations:

- **Agent 0 Final Total**: 333 + 215 = 548
- **Agent 1 Final Total**: 170 + 115 = 285

This allocation still heavily favors Agent 0, so let's adjust the allocation:

Revised:

- **Agent 1**: Items 4, 6, 8
- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7

### Final Check:

- **Agent 0 Valuation**: 75 (0) + 39 (1) + 42 (2) + 32 (3) + 84 (5) + 69 (7) = 341
- **Agent 1 Valuation**: 22 (6) + 70 (8) + 61 (4) = 153

Now let's present the allocations in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [4, 6, 8]
}
```
