Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  4  46  85  95  41  13  37  40  45
1  4  95  66  26  76  12  80  64  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to balance the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use a method that maximizes the minimum value or attempts to equalize the value of the items received by each agent as much as possible.

Let's calculate the total values that each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value for all items: 4 + 46 + 85 + 95 + 41 + 13 + 37 + 40 + 45 = 366
- Agent 1's total value for all items: 4 + 95 + 66 + 26 + 76 + 12 + 80 + 64 + 65 = 488

The goal is to allocate the items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Process:
1. Start by sorting items based on the difference in value between the two agents. The priority is to allocate items where one agent values it significantly more than the other.
2. Assign items to the agent who values them more until each agent has an equal number of items or as close as possible.

Let's go through this process:

- Item 1: Agent 1 values it significantly more (95 vs. 46). Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (85 vs. 66). Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (95 vs. 26). Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (76 vs. 41). Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (80 vs. 37). Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (64 vs. 40). Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it slightly more (65 vs. 45). Assign to Agent 1.
- Assign remaining items to balance the count:
  - Item 0: Assign to Agent 0 (Agent 0 now has items 0, 2, 3).
  - Item 5: Assign to Agent 0 (Agent 0 now has items 0, 2, 3, 5).

Now, each agent has received 4 items. Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3, 5 (Values: 4, 85, 95, 13)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 6, 7, 8 (Values: 95, 76, 80, 64, 65)

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
