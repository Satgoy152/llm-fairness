Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2  3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  24  53  8  34  48  98  39  45
1  79  93  64  7  88  74  15  61  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we can use the "maximin share" approach, which aims to maximize the least value each agent receives. Hereâ€™s one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation is as equal as possible.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 73 + 24 + 53 + 8 + 34 + 48 + 98 + 39 + 45 = 422
- Agent 1: 79 + 93 + 64 + 7 + 88 + 74 + 15 + 61 + 40 = 521

Now, allocate items to maximize fairness:

Agent 0 gets items: 6, 0, 5, 8  
Agent 0's total valuation: 98 + 73 + 48 + 45 = 264

Agent 1 gets items: 1, 4, 2, 7, 3  
Agent 1's total valuation: 93 + 88 + 64 + 61 + 7 = 313

These allocations aim to balance the total valuations each agent receives. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 2, 7, 3]
}
```
