Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  59  22  31   2  35  73  65  44
1  23  24  81   2  37   1  81  82  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that both agents receive approximately the same number of items. Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they get all items:

- Agent 0: 13 + 59 + 22 + 31 + 2 + 35 + 73 + 65 + 44 = 344
- Agent 1: 23 + 24 + 81 + 2 + 37 + 1 + 81 + 82 + 50 = 381

Now, let's distribute the items while keeping their total valuation as balanced as possible:

1. Sort the items based on the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 81, far more than Agent 0 who values it at 22. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 81, far more than Agent 0 who values it at 73. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 82, more than Agent 0 who values it at 65. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 59, more than Agent 1 who values it at 24. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 31, more than Agent 1 who values it at 2. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it at 50, more than Agent 0 who values it at 44. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 23, more than Agent 0 who values it at 13. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 35, far more than Agent 1 who values it at 1. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 37, far more than Agent 0 who values it at 2. Assign to Agent 1.

Final allocations:

Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 5]
Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8]

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and respects the relative valuations of the agents for each item.
