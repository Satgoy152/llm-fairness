Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  53  98  39  76  25  56  34  74
1  14  47  12  95  77  90  51  95  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will consider a method that attempts to maximize the valuation for each agent. This method is not necessarily the only way to allocate items, but it aims to ensure that each agent receives a subset of items that maximizes their total valuation.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive each item individually:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 40
- Item 1: 53
- Item 2: 98
- Item 3: 39
- Item 4: 76
- Item 5: 25
- Item 6: 56
- Item 7: 34
- Item 8: 74

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 14
- Item 1: 47
- Item 2: 12
- Item 3: 95
- Item 4: 77
- Item 5: 90
- Item 6: 51
- Item 7: 95
- Item 8: 14

Let's proceed with a simple allocation strategy to maximize the total value for each agent. We will allocate items in a way that tries to balance the total value each agent receives.

1. Assign items to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Ensure both agents get 4 or 5 items to keep the allocation balanced.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Item 0: Agent 0 (40 vs 14)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (53 vs 47)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (98 vs 12)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (39 vs 95)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (76 vs 77) [This was a close decision, but Agent 1 already has one high-value item (3)]
- Item 5: Agent 1 (25 vs 90)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (56 vs 51)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (34 vs 95)
- Item 8: Agent 1 (74 vs 14)

### Final Allocations:
Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]
Agent 1: Items [3, 5, 7, 8]

These allocations attempt to balance the total value while keeping the number of items roughly equal.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [3, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation is one possible fair distribution based on the given valuations, attempting to maximize each agent's satisfaction while keeping the allocation balanced.
