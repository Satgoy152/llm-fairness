Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  66  76  43  87  31  81  85  70
1  73  84  64  56  99  20  54  95  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and aim for a balanced distribution of total value. Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: \(55 + 66 + 76 + 43 + 87 + 31 + 81 + 85 + 70 = 594\)
   - Agent 1's total valuation: \(73 + 84 + 64 + 56 + 99 + 20 + 54 + 95 + 55 = 600\)

2. **Allocate Items to Balance Total Valuation:**
   - We aim to distribute the items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.
   - Given the small difference in total valuations, we will try to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation is approximately equal.

3. **Greedy Allocation Approach:**
   - Start by assigning items to the agent who values it more, while keeping track of the total valuation balance.

Using the valuations, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Items: 0 (55), 2 (76), 5 (31), 6 (81), 8 (70)
  - Total Valuation: \(55 + 76 + 31 + 81 + 70 = 313\)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Items: 1 (84), 3 (56), 4 (99), 7 (95)
  - Total Valuation: \(84 + 56 + 99 + 95 = 334\)

4. **Final Check and Adjustment:**
   - The total valuation difference is \(334 - 313 = 21\), which is reasonably balanced considering the discrete nature of items.

Finally, here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

(Note: The allocations may vary slightly depending on the strategy or method used to split the valuations as fairly as possible.)
