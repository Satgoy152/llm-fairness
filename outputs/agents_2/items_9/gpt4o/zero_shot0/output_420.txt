Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  50  33  84  18  71  99   9  37
1  30  30  58  69  43  38   4  41  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 30 58 69 43 38  4 41 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent's total valuation of the items they receive is as balanced as possible. Let's calculate the total valuation each agent would have for various allocations and adjust iteratively to find a fair distribution.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: [44, 50, 33, 84, 18, 71, 99, 9, 37]
- Agent 1's valuations: [30, 30, 58, 69, 43, 38, 4, 41, 36]

Next, analyze the items and their valuations to find a fair allocation:

1. Assign items with the highest differential to the agent valuing them more.
2. Balance the remaining items based on the total valuation.

Let's perform this step-by-step:

- For item 6, Agent 0 values it at 99, while Agent 1 values it at 4. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- For item 3, Agent 0 values it at 84, while Agent 1 values it at 69. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- For item 5, Agent 0 values it at 71, while Agent 1 values it at 38. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- For item 2, Agent 1 values it at 58, while Agent 0 values it at 33. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- For item 4, Agent 1 values it at 43, while Agent 0 values it at 18. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- For item 7, Agent 1 values it at 41, while Agent 0 values it at 9. Assign item 7 to Agent 1.

Now, we have the remaining items: 0, 1, and 8. Distribute them to balance the total valuations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (44 vs 30).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (50 vs 30).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (37 vs 36).

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation strives to balance the total valuation each agent gets from their items, considering their respective valuations.
