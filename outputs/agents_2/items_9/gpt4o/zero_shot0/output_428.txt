Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5   5  30  54  87  30  83  98  39
1  12  66  39  22  18  20  18  24  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. We will try to balance the allocation so that both agents receive similar total values.

Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. Start by sorting each item by the difference in value between the two agents to prioritize items that one agent values significantly more than the other.

2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more until we reach a balance in total value between the two agents.

Let's walk through the allocation process:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (12 vs 5). Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (66 vs 5). Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (30 vs 39). Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (54 vs 22). Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (87 vs 18). Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (30 vs 20). Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (83 vs 18). Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (98 vs 24). Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it more (39 vs 58). Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's calculate the total values for each agent:

- Agent 0: 30 (Item 2) + 54 (Item 3) + 87 (Item 4) + 30 (Item 5) + 83 (Item 6) + 98 (Item 7) = 382
- Agent 1: 12 (Item 0) + 66 (Item 1) + 22 (Item 3) + 18 (Item 4) + 20 (Item 5) + 18 (Item 6) + 24 (Item 7) + 58 (Item 8) = 220

The allocation is not balanced, so let's adjust the allocation to balance the total values more closely:

- Reassign Item 6 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.
- Reassign Item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

Recalculate the total values:

- Agent 0: 30 (Item 2) + 54 (Item 3) + 87 (Item 4) + 98 (Item 7) = 269
- Agent 1: 12 (Item 0) + 66 (Item 1) + 18 (Item 5) + 18 (Item 6) + 24 (Item 7) + 58 (Item 8) = 333

This allocation provides a more balanced distribution of total values between the agents.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
