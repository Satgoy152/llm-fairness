Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  50   7  10  70  90  13  44   8
1  80  48  15  80  11  20  14  59  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to use a "greedy" method where we assign items to the agent who values it the most, provided that it doesn't leave the other agent with an unfairly low valuation.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations of:
   - Item 4: 70
   - Item 5: 90
   - Item 1: 50

2. **Agent 1** has high valuations of:
   - Item 0: 80
   - Item 3: 80
   - Item 8: 95

We will allocate items based on the highest valuations while trying to keep a balance. After analyzing the table, a fair division could be:

- **Agent 0** gets items where they have relatively higher valuations compared to Agent 1.
- **Agent 1** gets items where they have relatively higher valuations compared to Agent 0.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 3, 8

This allocation gives each agent 5 and 4 items, respectively, and tries to balance the total valuation received by each agent.

The final JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 8]
}
```
