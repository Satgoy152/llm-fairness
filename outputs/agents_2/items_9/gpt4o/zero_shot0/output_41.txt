Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4  5   6   7   8
0  82  45  62   1  53  6  63   9  48
1  97  62  23  47  99  9  60  70  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A simple approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while keeping track of the number of items allocated to each agent.

Let's go through the steps:

1. Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the item index and the difference in valuation between the two agents, ordered by the absolute difference. This helps us decide which agent values the item significantly more than the other.

2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more.

3. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items by checking the allocation count.

Here's the allocation based on the given table:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, 5, 6, and 8.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, 4, and 7. 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and tries to maximize the total value they receive based on their valuations.
