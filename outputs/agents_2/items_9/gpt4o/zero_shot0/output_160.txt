Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  39  56  28  15  43  20  13  56
1  92  14  97  65  13  40  20  66  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that both agents receive an integer number of items. A common approach is to use the "greedy algorithm" method, which involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, provided that the allocation remains balanced. Let's go through the steps:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items combined.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items.

Here's how the allocation would look based on the valuations:

1. Agent 0 values items:
   - 0: 17
   - 1: 39
   - 2: 56
   - 3: 28
   - 4: 15
   - 5: 43
   - 6: 20
   - 7: 13
   - 8: 56

2. Agent 1 values items:
   - 0: 92
   - 1: 14
   - 2: 97
   - 3: 65
   - 4: 13
   - 5: 40
   - 6: 20
   - 7: 66
   - 8: 50

We'll allocate each item to the agent who values it higher:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (92 > 17)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (39 > 14)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (97 > 56)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (65 > 28)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (15 > 13)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (43 > 40)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (20 = 20), choose Agent 0 to balance
- Item 7: Agent 1 (66 > 13)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (56 > 50)

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and it attempts to maximize the satisfaction of both agents by giving each item to the agent who values it the most.
