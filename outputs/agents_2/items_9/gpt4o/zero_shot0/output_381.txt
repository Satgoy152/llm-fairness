Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  60  19  34  61  23  92  31  43
1  94  50  17   7  26  18  30   5  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[26 60 19 34 61 23 92 31 43]
 [94 50 17  7 26 18 30  5 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring a relatively balanced distribution of items. Let's look at the valuations and try to make allocations that seem fair:

### Valuation Table:

```
Items:  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
Agent 0: 26  60  19  34  61  23  92  31  43
Agent 1: 94  50  17   7  26  18  30   5  26
```

### Analysis:

- Agent 0 has higher valuations for items 1, 4, 6, and 8.
- Agent 1 has higher valuations for items 0, 3, 5, and 7.
- Item 2 is relatively low-valued for both agents, but Agent 0 values it slightly more.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. Assign items with the highest difference in valuation to the agent who values them more.
2. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, aiming for an equal number of items if possible.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 4, 6, 8
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 2, 3, 5, 7

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
