Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  25  88  51  56  99  76  25  72
1  46  83   7  67  97  16   8  34  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use the method of maximizing the minimum value that each agent receives. This approach ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

To implement this, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items combined.
2. Allocate items to maximize the minimum value each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total valuations and allocate the items:

### Total Valuations
- Agent 0's total value: \(9 + 25 + 88 + 51 + 56 + 99 + 76 + 25 + 72 = 501\)
- Agent 1's total value: \(46 + 83 + 7 + 67 + 97 + 16 + 8 + 34 + 16 = 374\)

### Allocation Strategy
To maximize fairness, consider each item's highest value to an agent and try to allocate it to that agent, ensuring each agent receives a fair share of the total value.

### Allocation Process
1. Item 2 (88) and Item 5 (99) have high values for Agent 0.
2. Item 4 (97) and Item 1 (83) have high values for Agent 1.
3. Allocate remaining items to balance the total valuation.

### Allocation Result

After running through this strategy, we can arrive at the following fair allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 7]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 4, 7

This allocation provides a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent gets a substantial portion of their preferred items.
