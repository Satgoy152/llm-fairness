Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  99  63  50  16  37  13  23  25
1  32  78  49   6  70  37  55  56  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's perceived value from the items they receive. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each agent picks the item that gives them the highest value until all items are allocated. This approach doesn't always guarantee strict fairness, but it often provides a good balance.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 81, while Agent 1 values it at 32. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 99, while Agent 1 values it at 78. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 63, while Agent 1 values it at 49. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 50, while Agent 1 values it at 6. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 16, while Agent 1 values it at 70. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Both agents value item 5 equally at 37. Since Agent 1 has fewer items so far, allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 13, while Agent 1 values it at 55. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 23, while Agent 1 values it at 56. Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 25, while Agent 1 values it at 38. Allocate item 8 to Agent 1.

After these allocations, both agents have received four items. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, with Agent 1 receiving one more item due to having lower initial value allocations.
