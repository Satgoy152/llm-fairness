Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  83  68  44  67   5   9   5  40
1  89  41   1  77   7  93  81  41  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items based on the valuations, we can use a method like the "maximum total valuation" approach, where we aim to maximize the total value each agent gets from their allocated items. We'll consider each agent's preferences and try to distribute the items to balance their perceived value.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [23, 83, 68, 44, 67, 5, 9, 5, 40]
- Agent 1: [89, 41, 1, 77, 7, 93, 81, 41, 97]

Let's start by allocating items based on maximizing the sum of valuations, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share.

### Allocation Strategy

1. Assign the item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets a fair total value.

### Allocation Process

- Item 0: Agent 1 values 89, Agent 0 values 23 → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 1: Agent 0 values 83, Agent 1 values 41 → Assign to Agent 0
- Item 2: Agent 0 values 68, Agent 1 values 1 → Assign to Agent 0
- Item 3: Agent 1 values 77, Agent 0 values 44 → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 4: Agent 0 values 67, Agent 1 values 7 → Assign to Agent 0
- Item 5: Agent 1 values 93, Agent 0 values 5 → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 6: Agent 1 values 81, Agent 0 values 9 → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 7: Agent 1 values 41, Agent 0 values 5 → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 8: Agent 1 values 97, Agent 0 values 40 → Assign to Agent 1

### Resulting Allocations

After the allocation, we ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the distribution is fair based on the perceived value.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items [1, 2, 4], and Agent 1 receives items [0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]. This allocation attempts to maximize fairness by considering each agent's highest valued items while keeping the item count balanced.
