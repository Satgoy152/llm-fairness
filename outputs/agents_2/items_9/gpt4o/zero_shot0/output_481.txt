Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1  2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  36  9  37  25  37  55   0  42
1  25   0  6  64  17  13  88  14  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to maximize the total utility each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring that each agent ends up with a similar number of items. Here's one possible way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Sort the items by the difference in value between the two agents, focusing on the item that provides the greatest relative benefit to one agent over the other.
3. Allocate the items accordingly, balancing the number of items each agent receives as closely as possible.

Following this method, we can proceed with the allocation:

1. Calculate total values:
   - Agent 0: 252
   - Agent 1: 292

2. Calculate differences for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values 11, Agent 1 values 25, diff = 14 (favor Agent 1)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values 36, Agent 1 values 0, diff = 36 (favor Agent 0)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values 9, Agent 1 values 6, diff = 3 (favor Agent 0)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values 37, Agent 1 values 64, diff = 27 (favor Agent 1)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values 25, Agent 1 values 17, diff = 8 (favor Agent 0)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values 37, Agent 1 values 13, diff = 24 (favor Agent 0)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values 55, Agent 1 values 88, diff = 33 (favor Agent 1)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values 0, Agent 1 values 14, diff = 14 (favor Agent 1)
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values 42, Agent 1 values 65, diff = 23 (favor Agent 1)

3. Allocate based on differences:

- Agent 0: Allocate items that favor Agent 0 more:
  - Items: 1, 2, 4, 5

- Agent 1: Allocate items that favor Agent 1 more:
  - Items: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8

Ensure both agents get a similar number of items:
- Agent 0 gets 4 items.
- Agent 1 gets 5 items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the items while respecting their preferences.
