Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  64  97  30  11  16  20  80  62
1  16   6  54  33  19  60  76  24  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [16  6 54 33 19 60 76 24 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for their allocated items. Below is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 86 + 64 + 97 + 30 + 11 + 16 + 20 + 80 + 62 = 466
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 16 + 6 + 54 + 33 + 19 + 60 + 76 + 24 + 37 = 325

2. **Potential Allocation Strategy:**
   - We want to allocate items such that the total valuation each agent receives is as equitable as possible. Here, we prioritize the items based on the value difference between the two agents and allocate accordingly.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
   - Allocate items to the agent with the higher valuation for each specific item.

   Let's allocate the items:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values more (86 vs. 16)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values more (64 vs. 6)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values more (97 vs. 54)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values more (33 vs. 30)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values more (19 vs. 11)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values more (60 vs. 16)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values more (76 vs. 20)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values more (80 vs. 24)
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values more (62 vs. 37)

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2, 7, 8]
   - Agent 1: Items [3, 4, 5, 6]

5. **Valuation Check for Fairness:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation for allocated items: 86 + 64 + 97 + 80 + 62 = 389
   - Agent 1's total valuation for allocated items: 33 + 19 + 60 + 76 = 188
   - The total valuations are not equal but are distributed based on the higher preference for each item.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 7, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
