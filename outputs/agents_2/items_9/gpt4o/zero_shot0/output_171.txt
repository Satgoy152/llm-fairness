Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  74  67  35  57  23  88  51  15
1  60  57  24  27  86  46  13  72  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share in terms of their valuations.

We'll use a method to ensure both agents are relatively satisfied with their allocations. We'll look at the differences in valuations between the agents for each item and try to maximize the sum of the valuations for each agent.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.
3. Ensure both agents receive a similar number of items.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 at 60. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 at 57. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 67, Agent 1 at 24. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 at 27. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 at 86. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 23, Agent 1 at 46. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 at 13. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 at 72. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 at 26. Assign to Agent 1.

Now let's check the allocation to ensure both agents have a fair share:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2, 3, 6] with total valuation: 64 + 74 + 67 + 35 + 88 = 328
- Agent 1: Items [4, 5, 7, 8] with total valuation: 86 + 46 + 72 + 26 = 230

Agent 0 has more items, but since Agent 1 values the items they have more highly, the allocation is balanced in terms of total valuation.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
