Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  77  43  67  37  34  99  45  20
1  75  89  52  10  43  20  77  54  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each receives a fair share of the items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Compute the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items. This helps in understanding the relative value each agent places on the items.

2. **Fair Division**: Aim to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is as evenly distributed as possible, while each agent receives an integer number of items.

3. **Iterative Allocation**: Allocate the items one by one to the agent who gains the most additional value from receiving that particular item, while keeping track of the number of items allocated to ensure fairness.

Let's apply this approach to the given data.

### Step 1: Compute Total Valuation

- Agent 0's total valuation: 72 + 77 + 43 + 67 + 37 + 34 + 99 + 45 + 20 = 494
- Agent 1's total valuation: 75 + 89 + 52 + 10 + 43 + 20 + 77 + 54 + 56 = 476

### Step 2: Allocate Items

We will iterate over each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring a balanced distribution of items.

1. Item 6 (99 vs 77): Allocate to Agent 0
2. Item 1 (77 vs 89): Allocate to Agent 1
3. Item 0 (72 vs 75): Allocate to Agent 1
4. Item 3 (67 vs 10): Allocate to Agent 0
5. Item 7 (45 vs 54): Allocate to Agent 1
6. Item 2 (43 vs 52): Allocate to Agent 1
7. Item 8 (20 vs 56): Allocate to Agent 1
8. Item 4 (37 vs 43): Allocate to Agent 1
9. Item 5 (34 vs 20): Allocate to Agent 0

### Step 3: Ensure Each Agent Has 4 or 5 Items

After the initial allocation, the distribution is:
- Agent 0: [6, 3, 5] (3 items)
- Agent 1: [1, 0, 7, 2, 8, 4] (6 items)

To ensure fairness, we need to transfer one item from Agent 1 to Agent 0. The item transferred should minimize the loss in total valuation for Agent 1.

Transfer item 4 from Agent 1 to Agent 0, as it has the lowest valuation impact (43 for Agent 1).

### Final Allocation

The final fair allocation is:
- Agent 0: [6, 3, 5, 4] (4 items)
- Agent 1: [1, 0, 7, 2, 8] (5 items)

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3, 5, 4],
    "1": [1, 0, 7, 2, 8]
}
```
