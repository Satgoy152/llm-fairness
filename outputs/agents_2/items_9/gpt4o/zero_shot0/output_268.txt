Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  38   2  93  93  91  25  52  29
1  73  21  21  83  56  16  33  32  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can attempt to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach to achieve this is to allocate items based on which agent values them more, while also trying to balance the overall valuation.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (73 vs. 57).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (38 vs. 21).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (21 vs. 2).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (93 vs. 83).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (93 vs. 56).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (91 vs. 16).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (33 vs. 25).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (52 vs. 32).
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it more (87 vs. 29).

Now, we need to ensure that the distribution is balanced. We could start by giving each agent the items they value more and then adjust if necessary to balance the total valuation:

Initial allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 6, 8]

Calculating the total valuation for each agent:
- Agent 0's total valuation: 38 + 93 + 93 + 91 + 52 = 367
- Agent 1's total valuation: 73 + 21 + 33 + 87 = 214

This allocation is imbalanced. We need to adjust the allocation to make it fairer. One way to do this is to reallocate some items, aiming to equalize the total valuation as closely as possible:

Revised allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 3, 4, 7]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 5, 6, 8]

Recalculating the total valuation for each agent:
- Agent 0's total valuation: 38 + 93 + 93 + 52 = 276
- Agent 1's total valuation: 73 + 21 + 16 + 33 + 87 = 230

This allocation is more balanced. Therefore, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
