Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  86  76  53  53  85  55  78  61
1  29  79  90  45  90  22  48  14  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. This can be approached by considering the valuations and distributing the items to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's assign the items one by one based on the highest value that hasn't been allocated yet, ensuring each agent receives 4 or 5 items.

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 90, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 90, allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 86, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 85, allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 78, allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 21, allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 53, allocate to Agent 0.
8. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 55, allocate to Agent 0.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it at 57, allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocation. Agent 0 should have 4 items, and Agent 1 should have 5 items, or vice versa. Adjust if necessary.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 5, 7
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4, 3, 6, 8

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 3, 6, 8]
}
```
