Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  53   8  30  91  36   2  94   9
1  15  52  58  49  86  56  70  35  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach to achieve this is to use a method like the "Round Robin" or "Greedy" method, where we iteratively assign items based on the highest remaining valuation for each agent.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents in a way that tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent and then allocate the items:

### Agent Valuations:
- Agent 0 Total Valuation: 96 + 53 + 8 + 30 + 91 + 36 + 2 + 94 + 9 = 419
- Agent 1 Total Valuation: 15 + 52 + 58 + 49 + 86 + 56 + 70 + 35 + 71 = 492

Since agent 1 has a higher total valuation, we could start by allocating items where they have the highest relative valuation compared to the other agent. By doing this iteratively, we can ensure a fair allocation.

### Allocation Process:
1. Sort items based on the absolute difference in valuations for the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item, ensuring the agents receive an integer number of items.

After applying this method, here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 4, and 7 with a total valuation of 96 + 91 + 94 = 281.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 with a total valuation of 52 + 58 + 49 + 56 + 70 + 71 = 356.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while also giving each agent an integer number of items.
