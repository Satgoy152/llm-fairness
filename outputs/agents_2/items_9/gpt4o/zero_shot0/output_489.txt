Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7  8
0  72  57  24   4  87  14  60  31  2
1  74  20  56  30  56  99  38  92  4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Sum the values each agent has for all items.

2. **Sort Items by Valuation Difference**: Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents and sort the items by this difference.

3. **Allocate Items**: Start allocating items to agents by alternating between agents, beginning with the agent who values the item more.

Let's calculate the allocations:

### Step 1: Total Valuation

- **Agent 0 Total Valuation**: 72 + 57 + 24 + 4 + 87 + 14 + 60 + 31 + 2 = 351
- **Agent 1 Total Valuation**: 74 + 20 + 56 + 30 + 56 + 99 + 38 + 92 + 4 = 469

### Step 2: Valuation Difference and Sorting

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 | Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) |
|------|---------|---------|---------------------------------|
| 0    | 72      | 74      | -2                              |
| 1    | 57      | 20      | 37                              |
| 2    | 24      | 56      | -32                             |
| 3    | 4       | 30      | -26                             |
| 4    | 87      | 56      | 31                              |
| 5    | 14      | 99      | -85                             |
| 6    | 60      | 38      | 22                              |
| 7    | 31      | 92      | -61                             |
| 8    | 2       | 4       | -2                              |

Sorting by difference:

1. Item 5 (Agent 1)
2. Item 7 (Agent 1)
3. Item 2 (Agent 1)
4. Item 3 (Agent 1)
5. Item 8 (Agent 1)
6. Item 0 (Agent 1)
7. Item 4 (Agent 0)
8. Item 6 (Agent 0)
9. Item 1 (Agent 0)

### Step 3: Allocation

Allocate items by alternating and ensuring a fair distribution:

- **Agent 0**: [4, 6, 1]
- **Agent 1**: [5, 7, 2, 3, 8, 0]

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 1],
    "1": [5, 7, 2, 3, 8, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items in a way that balances their total valuations as fairly as possible.
