Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  77  13   8  40  51  39  28  18
1  25  25  49  25  58  18  56  21  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [25 25 49 25 58 18 56 21 98]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. Let's evaluate each item and allocate them to the agent who values them most.

Letâ€™s look at the valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 values it at 25. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 values it at 25. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 values it at 49. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 values it at 25. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 values it at 58. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 values it at 18. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 values it at 56. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 values it at 21. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 18, Agent 1 values it at 98. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and that each item is allocated to the agent who values it more.
