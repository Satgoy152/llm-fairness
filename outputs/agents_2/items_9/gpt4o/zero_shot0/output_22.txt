Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  87  91  52  33  22  54  15  84
1  87  10  94  36   6  59  34  43   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 10 94 36  6 59 34 43  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total satisfaction for each agent. This involves considering both the number of items each agent receives and their individual valuations of those items.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   Valuations: [59, 87, 91, 52, 33, 22, 54, 15, 84]

2. **Agent 1**:  
   Valuations: [87, 10, 94, 36, 6, 59, 34, 43, 2]

A possible approach is to start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. However, we need to ensure that each agent ends up with an integer number of items. Let's try to balance the allocation based on the highest value:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it more (87 vs. 59).
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it more (87 vs. 10).
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it more (94 vs. 91).
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it more (52 vs. 36).
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it more (33 vs. 6).
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it more (59 vs. 22).
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it more (54 vs. 34).
- **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it more (43 vs. 15).
- **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it more (84 vs. 2).

Now, let's check if each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: [1, 3, 4, 6, 8] (5 items)
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 5, 7] (4 items)

This allocation is valid, as each agent receives a whole number of items. 

Thus, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 7]
}
```
