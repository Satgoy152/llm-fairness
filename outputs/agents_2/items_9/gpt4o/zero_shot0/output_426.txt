Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1  2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  55  9  29  73  10  36  84   0
1  67  84  1  62  20  69   2  23  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items. Let's go through the items and allocate them in a way that considers both agents' valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Both agents value this item equally at 67. This item can go to either agent. We'll decide based on the remaining items.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item more (84 vs 55). Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item more (9 vs 1). Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this item more (62 vs 29). Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values this item more (73 vs 20). Allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values this item more (69 vs 10). Allocate to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values this item more (36 vs 2). Allocate to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values this item more (84 vs 23). Allocate to Agent 0.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 1 values this item more (85 vs 0). Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Both agents should receive a fair allocation. Since there are 9 items, one agent will receive 4 items and the other 5 items.

- Agent 0 currently has 4 items (2, 4, 6, 7).
- Agent 1 currently has 5 items (1, 3, 5, 8, 0).

This allocation is fair and divides the items into integer numbers.

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 8, 0]
}
```
