Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  58  31  72  50  77  85  45  73
1   8  58  63  93  13  30  15  36  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm that iteratively assigns the item with the highest value to an agent. However, since there are only two agents, we can also aim for a balanced allocation in terms of the total value received by each agent.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive if we allocated the items in a way that balances these total values as closely as possible:

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Agent 0's total value = 0
   - Agent 1's total value = 0

2. **Items and Their Values for Each Agent:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 = 12, Agent 1 = 8
   - Item 1: Agent 0 = 58, Agent 1 = 58
   - Item 2: Agent 0 = 31, Agent 1 = 63
   - Item 3: Agent 0 = 72, Agent 1 = 93
   - Item 4: Agent 0 = 50, Agent 1 = 13
   - Item 5: Agent 0 = 77, Agent 1 = 30
   - Item 6: Agent 0 = 85, Agent 1 = 15
   - Item 7: Agent 0 = 45, Agent 1 = 36
   - Item 8: Agent 0 = 73, Agent 1 = 16

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value = 93)
     - Agent 1's total value = 93
   - **Item 6**: Allocate to Agent 0 (highest value = 85)
     - Agent 0's total value = 85
   - **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 0 (next highest value = 77)
     - Agent 0's total value = 162
   - **Item 8**: Allocate to Agent 0 (next highest value = 73)
     - Agent 0's total value = 235
   - **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 0 (next highest value = 50)
     - Agent 0's total value = 285
   - **Item 7**: Allocate to Agent 1 (next highest value = 36)
     - Agent 1's total value = 129
   - **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 1 (next highest value = 63)
     - Agent 1's total value = 192
   - **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 1 (next highest value = 58)
     - Agent 1's total value = 250
   - **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 0 (next highest value = 12)
     - Agent 0's total value = 297

4. **Final Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: [0, 4, 5, 6, 8]
   - Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 7]

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value that each agent receives as closely as possible.
