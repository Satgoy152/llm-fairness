Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  65  99  80  11  16  93  30  75
1   0  49  82   5  53  13  57  63  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. One way to approach this is through the "balanced" allocation method, aiming to give each agent approximately equal total valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would receive for a given allocation.
2. Adjust the allocation to try to balance the total values received as closely as possible.

Let's start with an initial allocation and then refine it:

Initial allocation idea (based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction for some items):

- Agent 0 seems to value items 2, 3, and 6 highly, so we can start by giving these to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values items 1, 4, and 7 highly, so we can start by giving these to Agent 1.
- Distribute the remaining items to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's calculate the total valuations for a more balanced allocation:

Agent 0: [0, 2, 3, 6, 8]  
Agent 1: [1, 4, 5, 7]

- Agent 0's total value: 56 (item 0) + 99 (item 2) + 80 (item 3) + 93 (item 6) + 75 (item 8) = 403
- Agent 1's total value: 49 (item 1) + 53 (item 4) + 13 (item 5) + 63 (item 7) = 178

Let's swap item 8 from Agent 0 with item 1 from Agent 1:

Agent 0: [0, 2, 3, 6]  
Agent 1: [1, 4, 5, 7, 8]

- Agent 0's total value: 56 + 99 + 80 + 93 = 328
- Agent 1's total value: 49 + 53 + 13 + 63 + 75 = 253

This is a better balance. Let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation should fairly balance the total value each agent receives.
