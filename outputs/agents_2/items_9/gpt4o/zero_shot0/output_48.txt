Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7  8
0  57  64   0   3   2   8  81  54  1
1  19  15  58  71  88  39  75   7  1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim for each agent to receive items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. We can use a simple strategy like the "maximum difference" method, where each item is given to the agent who values it the most.

Here's the step-by-step allocation based on the given table:

1. Compare the values that each agent assigns to each item.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more.

Let's apply this to the table:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 at 19. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 at 15. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 at 58. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 3, Agent 1 at 71. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 at 88. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 at 39. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 at 75. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 at 7. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 1, Agent 1 at 1. This is a tie, so we can allocate it to any agent. Let's allocate to Agent 0 for simplicity.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, giving each agent a share of the total value.
