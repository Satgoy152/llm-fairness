Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2  3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  49  98  3  99  50  37   4  87
1  97  89  25  5  11  48  15  18  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, one approach is to ensure that each agent receives a number of items that approximately equalizes their total valuation of the items they receive. This can be done by considering the total valuation each agent has for all items and then distributing the items to balance these valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 40 + 49 + 98 + 3 + 99 + 50 + 37 + 4 + 87 = 467
- Agent 1's total valuation: 97 + 89 + 25 + 5 + 11 + 48 + 15 + 18 + 46 = 354

Now, we want to allocate the items in such a way that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

1. Sort the items by the absolute difference in valuations for the two agents.
2. Allocate items starting with those with the largest difference, attempting to balance the total valuations.

Let's perform the allocation step by step:

1. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 values it at 11. Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 values it at 97. Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 values it at 25. Assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 values it at 89. Assign to Agent 1.
5. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 values it at 46. Assign to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 values it at 48. Assign to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 values it at 15. Assign to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 4, Agent 1 values it at 18. Assign to Agent 1.
9. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 3, Agent 1 values it at 5. Assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 8, 6, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 7]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items [4, 2, 8, 6, 3] and agent 1 receives items [0, 1, 5, 7]. This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations for each agent.
