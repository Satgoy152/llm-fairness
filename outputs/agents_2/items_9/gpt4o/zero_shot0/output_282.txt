Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  6  32  48   7   7  92  50   7  47
1  7  71  65  31  43  35  42  88  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 7 71 65 31 43 35 42 88 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the sum of the valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible, while also ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items. 
2. Allocate items in a way that balances these total values as evenly as possible.

Let's start by summing the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 6 + 32 + 48 + 7 + 7 + 92 + 50 + 7 + 47 = 296
- Agent 1's total valuation: 7 + 71 + 65 + 31 + 43 + 35 + 42 + 88 + 45 = 427

We then aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

1. Agent 0 has high value for item 5 (92) and item 6 (50). These would be good items for Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has high value for item 1 (71), item 2 (65), and item 7 (88). These would be good items for Agent 1.

We can proceed to allocate items based on these observations:

- Agent 0: Allocate items [0, 3, 5, 6]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 6 (item 0) + 7 (item 3) + 92 (item 5) + 50 (item 6) = 155

- Agent 1: Allocate items [1, 2, 4, 7, 8]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 71 (item 1) + 65 (item 2) + 43 (item 4) + 88 (item 7) + 45 (item 8) = 312

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
