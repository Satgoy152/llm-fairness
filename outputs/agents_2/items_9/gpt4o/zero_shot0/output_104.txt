Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  44  43  99  91  11  83  18  69
1  26  99  20  10  85   7  48  74  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One common way to approach this is to use a "greedy" algorithm that allocates items to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated. Here's how it could work for this scenario:

1. For each item, compare the valuations from both agents.
2. Allocate the item to the agent who has the higher valuation for it.
3. Continue this until all items are allocated.

Let's apply this method to the given valuations:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 | Allocated to |
|------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 0    | 44      | 26      | 0            |
| 1    | 44      | 99      | 1            |
| 2    | 43      | 20      | 0            |
| 3    | 99      | 10      | 0            |
| 4    | 91      | 85      | 0            |
| 5    | 11      | 7       | 0            |
| 6    | 83      | 48      | 0            |
| 7    | 18      | 74      | 1            |
| 8    | 69      | 22      | 0            |

After applying this allocation strategy, the resulting allocation would be:

Agent 0: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
Agent 1: [1, 7]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 7]
}
```
