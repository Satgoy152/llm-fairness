Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  91  59  47  77  58  97  53  54
1  75  90  83  94  25  49  76  66  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [75 90 83 94 25 49 76 66 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring they receive an integer number of items. One common approach is to allocate based on each agent's preference for the items, ensuring that the total value is approximately balanced.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Calculate total valuations for both agents:**
   - Agent 0: 85, 91, 59, 47, 77, 58, 97, 53, 54
   - Agent 1: 75, 90, 83, 94, 25, 49, 76, 66, 18

2. **Allocate items to maximize each agentâ€™s satisfaction:**
   - Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it more, ensuring a fair distribution of items.

3. **Check allocations:**
   - Ensure that both agents receive approximately equal total value and number of items. Adjust if necessary.

Here is one possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 7]
}
```

### Explanation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 4, 6, and 8.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 3, 5, and 7.
- The allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent while ensuring each gets an integer number of items.
