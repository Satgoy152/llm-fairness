Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  40  31  25  98  95  36  81  28
1  99  19  11   9  48  44  73  33  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Sum the Total Valuations:**
   - Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they received all items.
   - Agent 0's total valuation: \(71 + 40 + 31 + 25 + 98 + 95 + 36 + 81 + 28 = 505\)
   - Agent 1's total valuation: \(99 + 19 + 11 + 9 + 48 + 44 + 73 + 33 + 29 = 365\)

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - We aim for each agent to receive close to half of the total value.
   - Total sum of all valuations: \(505 + 365 = 870\)
   - Each agent should aim to receive approximately \(870 / 2 = 435\) in value.

3. **Item Allocation:**
   - Start by assigning items to the agent that values them the most, while keeping track of each agent's total valuation.
   - Adjust allocations to get closer to the target valuation of 435 for each agent.

4. **Initial Allocation by Highest Value:**
   - Agent 0 values: [0, 4, 5, 7] = 71 + 98 + 95 + 81 = 345
   - Agent 1 values: [1, 6] = 19 + 73 = 92

5. **Adjust Allocations:**
   - To balance, assign item 2 and item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 values: [1, 2, 3, 6] = 19 + 11 + 9 + 73 = 112
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 values: [1, 2, 3, 6, 8] = 19 + 11 + 9 + 73 + 29 = 141
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 values: [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8] = 19 + 11 + 9 + 73 + 33 + 29 = 174

6. **Finalize Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [0, 4, 5]
   - Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]

Now, let's present the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation received by each agent, considering their preferences for the items.
