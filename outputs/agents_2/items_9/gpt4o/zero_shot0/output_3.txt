Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  63   0  17  40  50  90  14  98
1  99  12  18   6  43  38  15  28   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 12 18  6 43 38 15 28  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuations to maximize fairness. One way to do this is by ensuring that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [66, 63, 0, 17, 40, 50, 90, 14, 98]
- Agent 1: [99, 12, 18, 6, 43, 38, 15, 28, 9]

Next, we'll iteratively allocate the items, trying to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Sort items by the difference in value for each agent:

   - Item 0: 99 (Agent 1) - 66 (Agent 0) = 33
   - Item 1: 12 (Agent 1) - 63 (Agent 0) = -51
   - Item 2: 18 (Agent 1) - 0 (Agent 0) = 18
   - Item 3: 6 (Agent 1) - 17 (Agent 0) = -11
   - Item 4: 43 (Agent 1) - 40 (Agent 0) = 3
   - Item 5: 38 (Agent 1) - 50 (Agent 0) = -12
   - Item 6: 15 (Agent 1) - 90 (Agent 0) = -75
   - Item 7: 28 (Agent 1) - 14 (Agent 0) = 14
   - Item 8: 9 (Agent 1) - 98 (Agent 0) = -89

   Sorting by the absolute difference (largest impact first):

   - Item 8: 89
   - Item 6: 75
   - Item 1: 51
   - Item 0: 33
   - Item 2: 18
   - Item 7: 14
   - Item 5: 12
   - Item 3: 11
   - Item 4: 3

2. Allocate items to balance total valuation:

   - Agent 0: [8, 6, 1] (98 + 90 + 63 = 251)
   - Agent 1: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7] (99 + 18 + 6 + 43 + 38 + 28 = 232)

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 6, 1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives only whole items.
