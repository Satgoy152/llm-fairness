Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  84  78  32  82  82   4  59  46
1  93  38  79  76  83  50  93  38  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[18 84 78 32 82 82  4 59 46]
 [93 38 79 76 83 50 93 38 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring both agents receive a similar number of items.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they solely received each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: [18, 84, 78, 32, 82, 82, 4, 59, 46]
- Agent 1's valuations: [93, 38, 79, 76, 83, 50, 93, 38, 42]

A fair allocation should aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign items to the agent who values them more, while ensuring a roughly equal number of items are assigned to each agent.

Let's perform this allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values this item more (93 vs 18).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values this item more (84 vs 38).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values this item more (78 vs 79) but it's very close.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values this item more (76 vs 32).
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values this item more (82 vs 83) but it's very close.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values this item more (82 vs 50).
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values this item more (93 vs 4).
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values this item more (59 vs 38).
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values this item more (46 vs 42).

Let's ensure an equal number of items (4 or 5 for each, as there are 9 items in total):

Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3, 6]

Let's adjust to have an equal number of items:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 5, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3, 4, 6]

This gives Agent 0 five items and Agent 1 four items. The valuation distribution is fairly balanced considering the preferences.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
