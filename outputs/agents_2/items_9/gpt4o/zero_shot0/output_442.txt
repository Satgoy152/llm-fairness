Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  38  22  46  74  50  85  63  94
1  45  67  76  49  89  32   3  89  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) for both agents while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. One approach is to use a greedy method to allocate items based on the highest relative valuation for each agent.

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
3. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values the item more until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Total Valuation**: 85 + 38 + 22 + 46 + 74 + 50 + 85 + 63 + 94 = 557
2. **Agent 1's Total Valuation**: 45 + 67 + 76 + 49 + 89 + 32 + 3 + 89 + 17 = 467

3. **Valuation Differences** (Agent 0's valuation minus Agent 1's valuation):
   - Item 0: 85 - 45 = 40
   - Item 1: 38 - 67 = -29
   - Item 2: 22 - 76 = -54
   - Item 3: 46 - 49 = -3
   - Item 4: 74 - 89 = -15
   - Item 5: 50 - 32 = 18
   - Item 6: 85 - 3 = 82
   - Item 7: 63 - 89 = -26
   - Item 8: 94 - 17 = 77

4. **Allocate Items**:
   - Allocate items based on the highest positive difference to Agent 0, and the highest negative difference to Agent 1.
   - Items to Agent 0: 6, 8, 0, 5
   - Items to Agent 1: 2, 1, 7, 4, 3

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations, aiming to maximize the total value each agent receives.
