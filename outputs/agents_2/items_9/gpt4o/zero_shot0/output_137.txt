Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3  4   5   6   7   8
0  21  14  71  32  9  79  17  67  58
1  50  16  88  44  6  43  11  30  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. We will ensure that each agent receives at least 4 items since there are 9 items in total.

Let's proceed with the allocation process:

1. **Initial Allocation by Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Balancing:**
   - If an agent ends up with more than 5 items, re-allocate the least valued item of that agent to the other agent until both have a fair number of items (4 or 5 items each).

**Step 1: Initial Allocation by Highest Valuation:**

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 50, Agent 0 values it at 21. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 16, Agent 0 values it at 14. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 88, Agent 0 values it at 71. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 44, Agent 0 values it at 32. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 values it at 6. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 values it at 43. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 17, Agent 1 values it at 11. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 67, Agent 1 values it at 30. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 48. Assign to Agent 0.

**Initial Allocation:**
- Agent 0: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 3]

**Step 2: Balancing:**

Both agents have a fair distribution of items (Agent 0 has 5 items, Agent 1 has 4 items), which respects the need for integer allocations and the attempt for fairness in the number of items.

**Final Allocation:**
```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation provides a balanced distribution of items while aiming to maximize each agent's total valuation based on their individual preferences.
