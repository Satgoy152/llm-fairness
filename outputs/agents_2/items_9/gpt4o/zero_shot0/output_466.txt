Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  47   4  93  59  74  83  82  84
1  84  84  95  54   8  76  54   6   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations of the items. One common strategy is to use a greedy approach, where each agent is allocated the item they value the most, one at a time, until all items are allocated.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. Create a list of items and their valuations for each agent.
2. Sort the items for each agent based on their valuations in descending order.
3. Alternate assigning the highest-valued remaining item to each agent until all items are allocated.

Let's apply this method to the given data:

Agent 0's valuations:  
0: 49, 1: 47, 2: 4, 3: 93, 4: 59, 5: 74, 6: 83, 7: 82, 8: 84

Agent 1's valuations:  
0: 84, 1: 84, 2: 95, 3: 54, 4: 8, 5: 76, 6: 54, 7: 6, 8: 1

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0's priority order (highest to lowest value):**  
   - 3 (93), 8 (84), 6 (83), 7 (82), 5 (74), 4 (59), 0 (49), 1 (47), 2 (4)

2. **Agent 1's priority order (highest to lowest value):**  
   - 2 (95), 0 (84), 1 (84), 5 (76), 3 (54), 6 (54), 4 (8), 7 (6), 8 (1)

### Allocation:

- **Step 1:**  
  - Agent 0 takes item 3 (93)
  - Agent 1 takes item 2 (95)

- **Step 2:**
  - Agent 0 takes item 8 (84)
  - Agent 1 takes item 0 (84)

- **Step 3:**
  - Agent 0 takes item 6 (83)
  - Agent 1 takes item 1 (84)

- **Step 4:**
  - Agent 0 takes item 7 (82)
  - Agent 1 takes item 5 (76)

- **Step 5:**
  - Agent 0 takes item 5 (74)
  - Agent 1 takes item 3 (54)

- **Step 6:**
  - Agent 0 takes item 4 (59)
  - Agent 1 takes item 6 (54)

- **Step 7:**
  - Agent 0 takes item 0 (49)
  - Agent 1 takes item 4 (8)

- **Step 8:**
  - Agent 0 takes item 1 (47)
  - Agent 1 takes item 7 (6)

- **Step 9:**
  - Agent 0 takes item 2 (4)
  - Agent 1 takes item 8 (1)

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 8, 6, 7, 5, 4, 0, 1, 2],
    "1": [2, 0, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4, 7, 8]
}
```

Note: The allocation process described ensures that both agents receive items in a way that maximizes their individual satisfaction based on the given valuations.
