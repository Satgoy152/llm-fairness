Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  78  93  36   4  98  71   1  70
1  99  14  12  23  35  55  92  30  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[17 78 93 36  4 98 71  1 70]
 [99 14 12 23 35 55 92 30 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim for an allocation that maximizes the total value for each agent while balancing the number of items. Given the table of valuations:

```
Agent 0: 17, 78, 93, 36,  4, 98, 71,  1, 70
Agent 1: 99, 14, 12, 23, 35, 55, 92, 30, 73
```

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it much higher (99 vs 17), so allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it higher (78 vs 14), so allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it higher (93 vs 12), so allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it higher (36 vs 23), so allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it higher (35 vs 4), so allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it higher (98 vs 55), so allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 1 values it higher (92 vs 71), so allocate to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7:** Agent 1 values it higher (30 vs 1), so allocate to Agent 1.
9. **Item 8:** Agent 1 values it higher (73 vs 70), but the difference is small. Since Agent 0 has more items already, allocate to Agent 1 for balance.

Let's present the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
