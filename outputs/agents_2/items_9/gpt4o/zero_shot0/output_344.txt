Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  27  48  86   4  31  99  83  93
1  37  94  18   7  95  78  84   2   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. This can be done using various methods, including optimization algorithms, but let's proceed with a simple approach to ensure a fair distribution of total value.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent attributes to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 73 + 27 + 48 + 86 + 4 + 31 + 99 + 83 + 93 = 544
- Agent 1's total value: 37 + 94 + 18 + 7 + 95 + 78 + 84 + 2 + 0 = 415

Given these values, we aim to allocate the items such that both agents receive approximately equal total value from their allocated items.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Start by allocating higher-value items to balance the total values.
2. Check total values after each allocation to ensure they are as balanced as possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Allocate items to Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 5, 6, 7]
- Allocate items to Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 4, 8]

Let's check the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives: 73 (item 0) + 48 (item 2) + 31 (item 5) + 99 (item 6) + 83 (item 7) = 334
- Agent 1 receives: 94 (item 1) + 7 (item 3) + 95 (item 4) + 0 (item 8) = 196

This allocation needs some adjustments since the total values are still unbalanced. Let's try another allocation:

- Allocate items to Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 5, 7]
- Allocate items to Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 4, 6, 8]

Now let's check the total values:

- Agent 0 receives: 73 (item 0) + 86 (item 3) + 31 (item 5) + 83 (item 7) = 273
- Agent 1 receives: 94 (item 1) + 18 (item 2) + 95 (item 4) + 84 (item 6) + 0 (item 8) = 291

This allocation is more balanced. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6, 8]
}
```
