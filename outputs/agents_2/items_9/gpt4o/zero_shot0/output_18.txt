Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4  5   6   7   8
0  44  32  31  43  12  1  31  51  96
1  97  99  25  19  56  8  77  16  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. One common approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm that assigns items based on the relative valuation difference between the agents.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of a possible allocation method:

1. Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute value of these differences, from highest to lowest.
3. Allocate items starting from the highest difference, ensuring that both agents end up with an equal number of items.

Let's calculate and allocate:

1. **Valuation Differences**:
   - Item 0: |44 - 97| = 53
   - Item 1: |32 - 99| = 67
   - Item 2: |31 - 25| = 6
   - Item 3: |43 - 19| = 24
   - Item 4: |12 - 56| = 44
   - Item 5: |1 - 8| = 7
   - Item 6: |31 - 77| = 46
   - Item 7: |51 - 16| = 35
   - Item 8: |96 - 47| = 49

2. **Sort by Differences**:
   - Item 1: 67
   - Item 0: 53
   - Item 8: 49
   - Item 6: 46
   - Item 4: 44
   - Item 7: 35
   - Item 3: 24
   - Item 5: 7
   - Item 2: 6

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - We alternate choosing the best available item for each agent, ensuring each gets 4 items (since there are 9 items, one agent will get an extra item).

   Given the valuations, a fair allocation could look like this:
   
   - Agent 1 has higher valuations for the top differences, so they will get those items.
   - Agent 0 will get items that agent 1 values less.

   Allocations:
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 0, 8, 6, 4
   - Agent 0: Items 7, 3, 5, 2

4. **Final Allocation**:
   ```json
   {
       "0": [7, 3, 5, 2],
       "1": [1, 0, 8, 6, 4]
   }
   ```
   
This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, with agent 1 receiving one more item due to the odd number of items available.
