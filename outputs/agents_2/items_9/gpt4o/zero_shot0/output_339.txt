Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  33  78  99  31  22  61  22  50
1  20  75  49  20  13  45  14   8  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider each agent's valuation and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction. One common approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation and aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable sum of their valuations for the items they receive.

Here are the valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0: [92, 33, 78, 99, 31, 22, 61, 22, 50]
- Agent 1: [20, 75, 49, 20, 13, 45, 14, 8, 35]

A reasonable allocation strategy is to assign the items to the agent who values them highest, ensuring that each agent gets an equal number of items since there are 9 items and 2 agents.

Let's analyze the valuations for each item and assign the items accordingly:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 20. Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 33, Agent 1 values it at 75. Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 values it at 49. Assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 values it at 20. Assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 31, Agent 1 values it at 13. Assign to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 45. Assign to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 14. Assign to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 8. Assign to Agent 0.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 values it at 35. Assign to Agent 0.

However, this allocation leads to an imbalance because Agent 0 receives 7 items and Agent 1 receives only 2 items. To balance the allocation, let's re-evaluate by swapping some items:

- Swap item 8 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

Now the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: [1, 5, 8]

This allocation satisfies a fair distribution between the two agents:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 5, 8]
}
```
