Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  58  13  33  70  73  75  43  99
1  74  89  79   1  59  48  56  34  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. This involves evaluating the valuations and attempting to distribute the items so that the overall value each agent receives is as equal as possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item by each agent:
   - Agent 0: [29, 58, 13, 33, 70, 73, 75, 43, 99]
   - Agent 1: [74, 89, 79, 1, 59, 48, 56, 34, 76]

2. The total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 493
   - Agent 1: 516

3. To achieve a fair allocation, we need to distribute the items while striving to make the total value for each agent as equal as possible.

4. A potential fair allocation could be:
   - Agent 0 gets items: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
   - Agent 1 gets items: 0, 3, 6, 8

5. Calculate the total value for each agent with this allocation:
   - Agent 0: 58 + 13 + 70 + 73 + 43 = 257
   - Agent 1: 74 + 33 + 75 + 99 = 281

This is one possible allocation that fairly distributes the items based on their valuations. The values are not perfectly equal, but they are reasonably balanced given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 6, 8]
}
```
