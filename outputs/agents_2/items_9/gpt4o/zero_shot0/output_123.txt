Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75   0  29  19   2  41  32  24   4
1  91  77  33  15  67  80  12  89  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. One approach is to iterate through each item and allocate it to the agent who values it more. Here's how the allocation could be done:

1. Compare the valuations of each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (91 vs 75), so give it to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (77 vs 0), so give it to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (33 vs 29), so give it to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (19 vs 15), so give it to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (67 vs 2), so give it to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (80 vs 41), so give it to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (32 vs 12), so give it to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (89 vs 24), so give it to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it more (75 vs 4), so give it to Agent 1.

After assigning the items based on the higher valuations, we get the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it more, maximizing the total valuation received by each agent.
