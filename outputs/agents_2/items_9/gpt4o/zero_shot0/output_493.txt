Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  80  57  37  86  95  84  32  46
1  53  22  61  51  48  71  44  82  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm, where we iteratively allocate items to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. List the item values for each agent:
   - Agent 0: [67, 80, 57, 37, 86, 95, 84, 32, 46]
   - Agent 1: [53, 22, 61, 51, 48, 71, 44, 82, 64]

2. For each item, identify which agent values it more, and allocate the item to that agent.

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (67 vs 53). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (80 vs 22). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (61 vs 57). Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (51 vs 37). Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (86 vs 48). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (95 vs 71). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (84 vs 44). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (82 vs 32). Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 8: Agent 1 values it more (64 vs 46). Allocate to Agent 1.

3. The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 7, 8]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is based on maximizing their respective valuations for the items.
