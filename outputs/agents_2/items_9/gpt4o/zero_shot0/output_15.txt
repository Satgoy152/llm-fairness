Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  78  20  32  55  39  77  37  77
1  26  50  52  40  83  76  73  81  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the two agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction of both agents while keeping the number of items allocated to each agent as equal as possible. Here's a strategy we can use:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to each item.
2. Assign items to the agent that values them more.
3. Balance the number of items by swapping or adjusting assignments as necessary to ensure each agent gets four or five items.

Let's allocate the items based on the given table:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 values it at 26. Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 values it at 50. Assign to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 values it at 52. Assign to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 values it at 40. Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 values it at 83. Assign to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 values it at 76. Assign to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 values it at 73. Assign to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 values it at 81. Assign to Agent 1.
9. **Item 8:** Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 values it at 75. Assign to Agent 0.

### Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 6, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]

Agent 0 has 4 items, and Agent 1 has 5 items. The allocation is fairly balanced with each agent getting either 4 or 5 items.

### Final Allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
