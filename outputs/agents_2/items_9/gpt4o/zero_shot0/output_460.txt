Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64   4  91  97  46  84  18   5  12
1  22  43  96  79  38  12  36  74  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to balance the total valuation that each agent receives. We'll try to maximize the satisfaction of each agent according to their valuations of the items.

Here's one way we can allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items:
   - Agent 0: 64 + 4 + 91 + 97 + 46 + 84 + 18 + 5 + 12 = 421
   - Agent 1: 22 + 43 + 96 + 79 + 38 + 12 + 36 + 74 + 96 = 496

2. Allocate items to balance the total valuations as closely as possible:
   - Start by allocating the highest-valued items for each agent and try to balance the total valuation.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 3 (value 97)
  - Item 5 (value 84)
  - Item 0 (value 64)
  - Item 2 (value 91)
  - Item 8 (value 12)
  
  Total value for Agent 0: 97 + 84 + 64 + 91 + 12 = 348

- Agent 1:
  - Item 2 (value 96)
  - Item 6 (value 36)
  - Item 1 (value 43)
  - Item 7 (value 74)
  - Item 4 (value 38)
  
  Total value for Agent 1: 96 + 36 + 43 + 74 + 38 = 287

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation between the two agents as fairly as possible.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 0, 2, 8],
    "1": [6, 1, 7, 4]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the total valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.
