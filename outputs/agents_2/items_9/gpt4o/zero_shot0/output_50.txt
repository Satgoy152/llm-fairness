Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  59  63  41  51  60  74  37  31
1  81  29  67  50   8  88  57  43  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets a similar total value of items. 

Let's consider the sum of valuations for each agent and try to distribute items such that the total value each agent receives is approximately equal.

Here are the total valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0: \( 44 + 59 + 63 + 41 + 51 + 60 + 74 + 37 + 31 = 460 \)
- Agent 1: \( 81 + 29 + 67 + 50 + 8 + 88 + 57 + 43 + 79 = 502 \)

We'll attempt to divide the items such that each agent's total valuation is balanced. This will also ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items.

One possible fair allocation could be:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 3, 4, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5, 6, 7]

Evaluating the total value each agent receives:
- Agent 0's total value: \( 44 + 63 + 41 + 51 + 31 = 230 \)
- Agent 1's total value: \( 59 + 88 + 57 + 43 = 247 \)

This allocation gives a fairly balanced total valuation to both agents.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 8],
    "1": [1, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
