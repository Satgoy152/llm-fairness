Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  47  76  87  88  26  14  99  83
1  42  28  78  81  64   7  65  66  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider a method that balances the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation. Here's a simple way to achieve a fair distribution:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would receive if they received all items.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values it the most, but also consider the current total valuation received by each agent to balance the allocation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Start with empty allocations for each agent.
2. For each item, allocate it to the agent who values it the most, keeping an eye on ensuring the overall distribution remains fair.

Let's allocate the items based on the valuations given:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (93 vs 42), so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (47 vs 28), so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (78 vs 76), so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (87 vs 81), so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (88 vs 64), so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (26 vs 7), so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (65 vs 14), so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (99 vs 66), so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (83 vs 13), so allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's review the distribution:

- Agent 0 has items [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8].
- Agent 1 has items [2, 6].

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 6]
}
```
