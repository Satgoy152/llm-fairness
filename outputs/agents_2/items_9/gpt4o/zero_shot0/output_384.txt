Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  47  77  68  46  48   4  30  48
1  56  77  73  14  32  56  88   5  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to distribute the items in a way that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value items**: Look at the items that have the highest valuations by any agent and allocate them to those agents.

2. **Balance the number of items**: Ensure that each agent receives a balanced number of items, given there are 9 items, one agent will receive 5 items, and the other will receive 4 items.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0's valuations** (from highest to lowest): 
  - Item 2: 77
  - Item 3: 68
  - Item 1: 47
  - Item 4: 46
  - Item 5: 48
  - Item 8: 48
  - Item 7: 30
  - Item 0: 22
  - Item 6: 4

- **Agent 1's valuations** (from highest to lowest):
  - Item 6: 88
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 73
  - Item 5: 56
  - Item 0: 56
  - Item 4: 32
  - Item 3: 14
  - Item 8: 17
  - Item 7: 5

3. **Allocate based on maximum valuations**:

   - Item 6 (Agent 1 - 88)
   - Item 2 (Agent 0 - 77)
   - Item 1 (Agent 1 - 77)
   - Item 3 (Agent 0 - 68)
   - Item 5 (Agent 0 - 48)
   - Item 0 (Agent 1 - 56)
   - Item 4 (Agent 0 - 46)
   - Item 8 (Agent 0 - 48)
   - Item 7 (Agent 1 - 5)

By this allocation, Agent 0 receives 5 items, and Agent 1 receives 4 items. The allocation is fairly distributed based on the highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5, 4, 8],
    "1": [6, 1, 0, 7]
}
```
