Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  64  81  47  97  36  13  59  30
1  11  94  73  83  20  73  87  43  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation and aim to maximize their overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. A common approach is to use the concept of envy-free allocation or max-min fairness. Given the valuations, we can attempt to distribute the items to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here are the steps for allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Attempt to allocate items so that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 93 + 64 + 81 + 47 + 97 + 36 + 13 + 59 + 30 = 520
- Agent 1's total valuation: 11 + 94 + 73 + 83 + 20 + 73 + 87 + 43 + 54 = 538

The goal is to allocate the items such that the total value each agent receives is as close as possible. We can try the following allocation:

1. Allocate items to Agent 0:
   - Items: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 93 + 47 + 97 + 13 + 59 = 309

2. Allocate items to Agent 1:
   - Items: 1, 2, 5, 8
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 94 + 73 + 73 + 54 = 294

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation for each agent as evenly as possible.

The resulting allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 8]
}
```
