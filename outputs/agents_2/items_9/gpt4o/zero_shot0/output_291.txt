Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  91  25  39   6  78  31  87  36
1  28  57  71  14  48  14  33  19  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a simple greedy approach, considering each agent's highest valued items until all items are allocated.

First, let's list the items in order of preference for each agent based on the value:

**Agent 0 Preferences:**
- Item 1 (91)
- Item 7 (87)
- Item 5 (78)
- Item 3 (39)
- Item 8 (36)
- Item 2 (25)
- Item 6 (31)
- Item 0 (16)
- Item 4 (6)

**Agent 1 Preferences:**
- Item 2 (71)
- Item 1 (57)
- Item 4 (48)
- Item 6 (33)
- Item 8 (26)
- Item 0 (28)
- Item 3 (14)
- Item 5 (14)
- Item 7 (19)

Now, we allocate items to each agent based on their preferences, ensuring each item is allocated only once.

1. Allocate items based on the highest value for each agent, alternating between them to ensure fairness.
2. If an agent's highest preferred item is already allocated, move to the next preferred item.

**Allocation:**

1. Agent 0 gets Item 1 (91)
2. Agent 1 gets Item 2 (71)
3. Agent 0 gets Item 7 (87)
4. Agent 1 gets Item 4 (48)
5. Agent 0 gets Item 5 (78)
6. Agent 1 gets Item 6 (33)
7. Agent 0 gets Item 3 (39)
8. Agent 1 gets Item 0 (28)
9. Agent 0 gets Item 8 (36)

This way, both agents receive four items, and the allocation is balanced based on their preferences.

**Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7, 5, 3, 8],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 0]
}
```
