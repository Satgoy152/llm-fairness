Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  65  32  57  97  77  64  85  24
1  55  85  38  29  34  52  74  30  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the method of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that both agents feel they have received a fair value based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation and find a fair division:

Agent 0's total valuation for each item:  
- 0: 2
- 1: 65
- 2: 32
- 3: 57
- 4: 97
- 5: 77
- 6: 64
- 7: 85
- 8: 24

Agent 1's total valuation for each item:  
- 0: 55
- 1: 85
- 2: 38
- 3: 29
- 4: 34
- 5: 52
- 6: 74
- 7: 30
- 8: 78

We can try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while keeping the allocations balanced.

One way to achieve a fair allocation is as follows:

- Assign items with higher valuations for each agent while ensuring an equal or nearly equal number of items for each agent.

After analyzing the valuations, a fair allocation could be:

Agent 0 gets items: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8  
Agent 1 gets items: 0, 4, 5, 7  

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items.
