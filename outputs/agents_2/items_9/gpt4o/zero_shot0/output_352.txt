Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  60  33  41  43  54  39  25  57
1  39  70   2  76  43  67   5  23  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [39 70  2 76 43 67  5 23 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of both agents and aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each gets an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy strategy, assigning items one by one to the agent who values them more, while trying to balance the total number of items allocated to each agent.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [40, 60, 33, 41, 43, 54, 39, 25, 57]
- Agent 1 values: [39, 70, 2, 76, 43, 67, 5, 23, 73]

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (70 vs. 60) - allocate to Agent 1
2. Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (76 vs. 41) - allocate to Agent 1
3. Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (67 vs. 54) - allocate to Agent 1
4. Item 8: Agent 1 values it more (73 vs. 57) - allocate to Agent 1

Now let's check the remaining items and try to balance the allocation:

5. Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (40 vs. 39) - allocate to Agent 0
6. Item 4: Both value equally (43 vs. 43) - allocate to Agent 0 to balance number of items
7. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (33 vs. 2) - allocate to Agent 0
8. Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (39 vs. 5) - allocate to Agent 0
9. Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (25 vs. 23) - allocate to Agent 0

Finally, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items, and each agent receives items they value highly, considering the overall distribution of values.
