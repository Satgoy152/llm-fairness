Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  13  68  78  72  97  15  89  62
1  58   6  14  45  11  75   3  58  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. We will aim to allocate items in such a way that the total valuation each agent has for their assigned items is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the total value for different allocations and find a balanced distribution:

### Step 1: Initial Analysis
- Agent 0's total valuation for all items: 68 + 13 + 68 + 78 + 72 + 97 + 15 + 89 + 62 = 562
- Agent 1's total valuation for all items: 58 + 6 + 14 + 45 + 11 + 75 + 3 + 58 + 87 = 357

### Step 2: Fair Allocation
We need to allocate the items such that both agents have a relatively balanced total valuation, considering one agent starts with a higher total potential valuation.

Here's a possible allocation that attempts to balance the values:

- Assign items to Agent 0 with higher valuations for Agent 0 and lower for Agent 1.
- Assign items to Agent 1 with higher valuations for Agent 1 and lower for Agent 0.

### Step 3: Allocation
After testing different combinations, the following allocation balances the valuations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 3, 5, 6]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 68 + 68 + 78 + 97 + 15 = 326
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4, 7, 8]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 6 + 11 + 58 + 87 = 162

### Final Allocation in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the satisfaction for each agent based on their valuations of the items while ensuring all items are allocated.
