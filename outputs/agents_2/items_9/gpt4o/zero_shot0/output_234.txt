Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7  8
0  78  45  56  59   7  73  55   6  7
1  53  56  19  37  66  52  45  39  9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initial Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [78, 45, 56, 59, 7, 73, 55, 6, 7]
   - Agent 1: [53, 56, 19, 37, 66, 52, 45, 39, 9]

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it highest (78 vs. 53), so allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it highest (56 vs. 45), so allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it highest (56 vs. 19), so allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it highest (59 vs. 37), so allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it highest (66 vs. 7), so allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it highest (73 vs. 52), so allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it highest (55 vs. 45), so allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it highest (39 vs. 6), so allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 8: Agent 1 values it highest (9 vs. 7), so allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 3, 5, 6]
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 4, 7, 8]

4. **JSON Representation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items while maximizing their respective valuations.
