Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  62  12  73  28  56  92  92  76
1  77  96  32  17  58  63  49  31  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a simple approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's evaluate the values:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 values it at 77. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 values it at 96. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 values it at 32. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 values it at 17. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 values it at 58. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 values it at 63. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 49. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 31. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 values it at 76. This is a tie; we can choose to break it by alternating or another fair method. Here, let's assign it to Agent 0 to balance the number of items.

Based on the above allocations, here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive an integer number of items, and the allocations are made based on the highest valuation for each item.
