Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  76   0  62  19  61   2  76  46
1  84  51  27  72  67   7  88  86  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall utility. One common approach is to use a method like the "Envy-Free" allocation, where each agent feels that they have received an equal or better share compared to the other agent.

Let's begin by comparing the valuations for each item between the two agents and assigning the item to the agent who values it more.

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 84, while Agent 0 values it at 9. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 76, while Agent 1 values it at 51. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 27, while Agent 0 values it at 0. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 72, while Agent 0 values it at 62. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 67, while Agent 0 values it at 19. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 61, while Agent 1 values it at 7. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 88, while Agent 0 values it at 2. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 86, while Agent 0 values it at 76. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it at 83, while Agent 0 values it at 46. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's count the items allocated to each agent:

- Agent 0 has been allocated items: 1, 5
- Agent 1 has been allocated items: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8

To ensure fairness, we should balance the number of items each agent receives. Agent 1 currently has more items. Let's adjust by transferring one item with the least value difference back to Agent 0. Item 2 has the least difference in valuation (27 vs. 0), so we will transfer it to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: 1, 2, 5
- Agent 1: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
