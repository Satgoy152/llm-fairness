Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  44  39  11  62  93  86  47  58
1   9   0  62  70  93  94  46  44  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. One such method is the "Envy-Free" allocation.

Let's evaluate the total values for different allocations:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent if they receive each item.

2. Try to balance the allocation so that the total value is as fair as possible between the two agents.

Here's how we can do it:

- Agent 0's total values for each item: [91, 44, 39, 11, 62, 93, 86, 47, 58]
- Agent 1's total values for each item: [9, 0, 62, 70, 93, 94, 46, 44, 88]

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Select items with higher relative value for Agent 0 compared to Agent 1.
- Agent 1: Select items with higher relative value for Agent 1 compared to Agent 0.

### Allocation:
- Items that Agent 0 values significantly higher: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7
- Items that Agent 1 values significantly higher: 2, 3, 4, 8

Now, we check the allocation balance:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 1, 5, 6, 7]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 91 + 44 + 93 + 86 + 47 = 361
- Agent 1 gets items: [2, 3, 4, 8]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 62 + 70 + 93 + 88 = 313

This allocation gives a fairly balanced distribution of total values.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 8]
}
