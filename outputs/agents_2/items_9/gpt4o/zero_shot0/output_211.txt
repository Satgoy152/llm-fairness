Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  72  14  55  52  12  45  87  55
1  79  31  99  33   5  67  43  36  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. We will try to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is as close as possible, while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 39 + 72 + 14 + 55 + 52 + 12 + 45 + 87 + 55 = 431
- Agent 1's total valuation: 79 + 31 + 99 + 33 + 5 + 67 + 43 + 36 + 13 = 406

Next, we'll allocate items to balance the total valuation:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 since it has a high value for them.
2. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 since it has a high value for them.
3. Continue allocating based on maximizing each agent's value for the remaining items.

After experimenting with allocations, a possible fair allocation would be:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
- Agent 1: [2, 7]

Now, let's calculate the total valuations for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 39 + 72 + 55 + 52 + 12 + 45 + 55 = 330
- Agent 1's total valuation: 99 + 87 = 186

This allocation might not seem balanced, so we might need to try another distribution to get the total valuations closer. Let's adjust by giving agent 1 more items:

- Agent 0: [1, 3, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 4, 7, 8]

Recalculate:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 72 + 55 + 12 + 45 = 184
- Agent 1's total valuation: 39 + 99 + 5 + 87 + 13 = 243

This distribution is still imbalanced. Let's try one more time:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 4, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: [2, 3, 5, 8]

Recalculate:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 39 + 72 + 52 + 45 + 87 = 295
- Agent 1's total valuation: 14 + 33 + 67 + 13 = 127

It seems we are struggling to balance them perfectly, but the goal is to get as close as possible. The final allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation is not perfectly balanced but is a reasonable attempt given the constraints of the problem.
