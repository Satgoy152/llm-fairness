Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  59  62  68  12  82  27  71  42
1  51  65  47  73  49  43  47  96  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that both agents receive an equal or nearly equal number of items. There are multiple ways to approach this problem, but for simplicity, we can use a method where each item is assigned to the agent who values it more, while ensuring that the total number of items is balanced between the agents.

Let's evaluate the items:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (51 vs 18).
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (65 vs 59).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (62 vs 47).
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (73 vs 68).
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (49 vs 12).
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (82 vs 43).
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (27 vs 47).
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (96 vs 71).
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (42 vs 21).

2. Allocate items based on who values it more, ensuring a balance in the number of items:
   - Give items 2, 5, 6, 8 to Agent 0.
   - Give items 0, 1, 3, 4, 7 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives 4 items to Agent 0 and 5 items to Agent 1, which is balanced given the odd total number of items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
