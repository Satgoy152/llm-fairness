Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  44  34  55  53  62  96  57  11
1  83  59  17   7  57  16  43  68  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations provided, we need to find a distribution that balances the values as evenly as possible.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Try to distribute the items such that the difference in total value received by each agent is minimized.

Let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0 total value: `41 + 44 + 34 + 55 + 53 + 62 + 96 + 57 + 11 = 453`
- Agent 1 total value: `83 + 59 + 17 + 7 + 57 + 16 + 43 + 68 + 62 = 412`

The goal is to allocate items such that the sum of values for each agent is as balanced as possible. Here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocates items `[0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8]` with values `[41, 44, 55, 62, 96, 11]`.
- **Agent 1**: Allocates items `[2, 4, 7]` with values `[17, 57, 68]`.

Summing up the values for the allocations:

- Agent 0 total value for allocated items: `41 + 44 + 55 + 62 + 96 + 11 = 309`
- Agent 1 total value for allocated items: `17 + 57 + 68 = 142`

This way, each agent gets an integer number of items and the allocation attempts to balance the total value as evenly as possible.

    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [2, 4, 7]
}
