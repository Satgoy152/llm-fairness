Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  53  79  44  70  18  82  64  33
1  55  83  89  45  44  19  70  83  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's calculate the total value each item holds for each agent and then allocate the items accordingly.

The initial valuations for each item by each agent are:

Agent 0: [16, 53, 79, 44, 70, 18, 82, 64, 33]

Agent 1: [55, 83, 89, 45, 44, 19, 70, 83, 35]

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. We can start by assigning the item with the highest difference in valuation to the agent who values it the most. For item 2, Agent 1 values it at 89 and Agent 0 at 79. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

2. Next, for item 7, Agent 1 values it at 83, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 64. Assign item 7 to Agent 1.

3. For item 1, Agent 1 values it at 83, higher than Agent 0's valuation of 53. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

4. For item 6, Agent 0 values it at 82, higher than Agent 1's valuation of 70. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.

5. For item 4, Agent 0 values it at 70, higher than Agent 1's valuation of 44. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

6. For item 3, both agents have similar valuations, but Agent 0 has a slightly lower total valuation so far. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

7. For item 5, Agent 0 values it at 18, which is similar to Agent 1's valuation of 19. Since Agent 0 still has a lower total valuation, assign item 5 to Agent 0.

8. For item 0, Agent 1 values it at 55, higher than Agent 0's valuation of 16. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

9. For item 8, Agent 1 values it at 35, which is slightly higher than Agent 0's valuation of 33. Assign item 8 to Agent 1.

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 7, 8]
}
```
