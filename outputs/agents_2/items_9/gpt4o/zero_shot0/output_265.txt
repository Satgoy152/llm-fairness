Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  52  74  63  87  57   9  31  92
1   7  35  74  79  21  31  26  43  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each gets an integer number of items. This can be approached by considering the value of each item to both agents and trying to balance the total value received.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Item**: 
   For each item, consider the value it holds for each agent.

2. **Compare Values Per Item**:
   Assign each item to the agent who values it more, as long as it doesn't create a significant imbalance in the total value received by each agent.

3. **Iterate for Fair Balance**:
   Continuously adjust the allocations to ensure that the distribution is as fair as possible in terms of the total value each agent receives.

Let's implement this:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 82, Agent 1 values it at 7. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 52, Agent 1 values it at 35. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Both agents value it equally at 74. Assign to Agent 0 to balance total values.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 63, Agent 1 values it at 79. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 values it at 21. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 values it at 31. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 values it at 26. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 31, Agent 1 values it at 43. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 65. Assign to Agent 0.

Now let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the total value each agent receives by ensuring each agent gets the items they value more highly, within a reasonable distribution.
