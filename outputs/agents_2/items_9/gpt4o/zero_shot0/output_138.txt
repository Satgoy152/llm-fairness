Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  22  11  21  47  12  99  68   2
1  23  62  80  57  49  99  58   8  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [23 62 80 57 49 99 58  8 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent receives a whole number of items. Let's examine the valuations and proceed with an allocation strategy.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's highest value is for item 6 (99).
   - Agent 1's highest value is for item 5 (99).

2. **Assign High-Value Items:**
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Continue Assigning Based on Remaining Highest Values:**

   **Agent 0:**
   - After item 6, the next highest values for Agent 0 are:
     - Item 0 (66)
     - Item 7 (68)
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (as it's higher than 0).

   **Agent 1:**
   - After item 5, the next highest values for Agent 1 are:
     - Item 2 (80)
     - Item 8 (88)
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (as it's higher than 2).

4. **Alternate Assignment:**
   - Agent 0:
     - Assign item 0.
   - Agent 1:
     - Assign item 2.

5. **Continue with Remaining:**
   - Agent 0:
     - Assign item 4 (47)
   - Agent 1:
     - Assign item 3 (57)

6. **Final Assignment of Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0:
     - Assign item 1 (22)
   - Agent 1:
     - Assign item 9 (88)

### Final Allocation:

Based on the above strategy, the fair allocation would be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing their total valuations based on the given preferences.
