Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  68   2  81  67  63  98  91  92
1  30  24  63  78  30   6   0  25  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [30 24 63 78 30  6  0 25 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. This can be approached by assigning items based on their valuations for each agent.

Let's evaluate the items based on the given valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 8
- Item 1: 68
- Item 2: 2
- Item 3: 81
- Item 4: 67
- Item 5: 63
- Item 6: 98
- Item 7: 91
- Item 8: 92

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 30
- Item 1: 24
- Item 2: 63
- Item 3: 78
- Item 4: 30
- Item 5: 6
- Item 6: 0
- Item 7: 25
- Item 8: 17

To maximize the total valuation, we can assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Compare the valuation for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the higher valuation.

Allocations:
- Item 0: Agent 1 (30 > 8)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (68 > 24)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (63 > 2)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (81 > 78)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (67 > 30)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (63 > 6)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (98 > 0)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (91 > 25)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (92 > 17)

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
