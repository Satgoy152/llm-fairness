Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1  2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50   4  3  91  29  14  76  73  10
1  77  19  8  21  26  62  42  22  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. A common approach to achieve this is to use a "greedy" algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with a similar number of items.

Let's work through the allocations:

1. Identify the highest value for each item and allocate it to the respective agent:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 77, Agent 0 values it at 50. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 4, Agent 1 values it at 19. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 3, Agent 1 values it at 8. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 values it at 21. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 29, Agent 1 values it at 26. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 values it at 62. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 values it at 42. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 values it at 22. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 10, Agent 1 values it at 55. Allocate to Agent 1.

2. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Currently, Agent 0 has 4 items (3, 4, 6, 7) and Agent 1 has 5 items (0, 1, 2, 5, 8). The distribution is already balanced in terms of the number of items.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items based on their preferences.
