Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  76  23   1   9  94  58  82  57
1   7   3  35  25  16  76  28  91  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that both agents are satisfied with their allocation. A common strategy is to use an optimization approach like the "envy-free" or "maximum sum of utilities" allocation. For simplicity, let's proceed with a balanced allocation based on maximizing the total value each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive if we allocate the items optimally:

1. We will assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. We will ensure that both agents get a relatively balanced number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the values provided:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (value 25) vs. Agent 1 (value 7) → Assign to Agent 0
- Item 1: Agent 0 (value 76) vs. Agent 1 (value 3) → Assign to Agent 0
- Item 2: Agent 0 (value 23) vs. Agent 1 (value 35) → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 3: Agent 0 (value 1) vs. Agent 1 (value 25) → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 4: Agent 0 (value 9) vs. Agent 1 (value 16) → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 5: Agent 0 (value 94) vs. Agent 1 (value 76) → Assign to Agent 0
- Item 6: Agent 0 (value 58) vs. Agent 1 (value 28) → Assign to Agent 0
- Item 7: Agent 0 (value 82) vs. Agent 1 (value 91) → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 8: Agent 0 (value 57) vs. Agent 1 (value 16) → Assign to Agent 0

Now, let's count the number of items each agent receives:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 5, 6, 8] (5 items)
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 4, 7] (4 items)

Given the criteria to fairly allocate, we should balance the number of items. Therefore, we need to adjust the allocation:

- Reassign one item from Agent 0 to Agent 1. Let's choose the item with the minimal difference in valuation (Item 8) as it has the smallest differential in value (Agent 0 values it at 57, and Agent 1 values it at 16).

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 4, 7, 8]

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
