Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  17  55  78  98  56  36  80   3
1  52  64  92  87  20  70  38  22  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52 64 92 87 20 70 38 22 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. There are 9 items to be divided among 2 agents, so each agent should receive either 4 or 5 items.

Let's evaluate the valuations and make allocations:

### Agent 0's Valuations:
- Item 0: 89
- Item 1: 17
- Item 2: 55
- Item 3: 78
- Item 4: 98
- Item 5: 56
- Item 6: 36
- Item 7: 80
- Item 8: 3

### Agent 1's Valuations:
- Item 0: 52
- Item 1: 64
- Item 2: 92
- Item 3: 87
- Item 4: 20
- Item 5: 70
- Item 6: 38
- Item 7: 22
- Item 8: 80

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Prioritize giving each agent the items they value the most.
2. Ensure each agent receives 4 or 5 items.

#### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Agent 0** values Item 4 the highest (98), so assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values Item 2 the highest (92), so assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** values Item 0 second highest (89), so assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** values Item 3 second highest (87), so assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 0** values Item 7 third highest (80), so assign Item 7 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1** values Item 8 third highest (80), so assign Item 8 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 0** values Item 3 fourth highest (78), but it's already assigned to Agent 1. Next highest is Item 5 (56), so assign Item 5 to Agent 0.
8. **Agent 1** values Item 5 fourth, but it's already assigned to Agent 0. Next highest is Item 1 (64), so assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
9. Remaining item, Item 6, goes to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 4, 5, 7, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 8, 1]

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 7, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 8, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring a fair distribution of items.
