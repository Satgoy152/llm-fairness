Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  97  63  43  82  68  56  78  98
1  11  78  58  20  44  46  13  84  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 78 58 20 44 46 13 84 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a method like the "max-min fairness" approach, which tries to balance the allocation based on the valuations provided.

Let's start by examining the valuation table:

Agent 0's valuations: [59, 97, 63, 43, 82, 68, 56, 78, 98]  
Agent 1's valuations: [11, 78, 58, 20, 44, 46, 13, 84, 18]  

To achieve fairness, we will allocate items giving priority to the agent who values them the most, while maintaining balance in the number of items allocated.

1. **Agent 0's highest value item is** item 8 (value 98). Let's allocate item 8 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1's highest value item is** item 7 (value 84). Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

Continuing this process while checking to keep the number of items as balanced as possible:

3. **Item 1**: Agent 0 (value 97) vs Agent 1 (value 78) – Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 4**: Agent 0 (value 82) vs Agent 1 (value 44) – Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 0**: Agent 0 (value 59) vs Agent 1 (value 11) – Allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 2**: Agent 0 (value 63) vs Agent 1 (value 58) – Allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Item 5**: Agent 0 (value 68) vs Agent 1 (value 46) – Allocate to Agent 0.
8. **Item 6**: Agent 0 (value 56) vs Agent 1 (value 13) – Allocate to Agent 0.
9. **Item 3**: Agent 0 (value 43) vs Agent 1 (value 20) – Allocate to Agent 0.

After this allocation, Agent 0 has been allocated all the items, while Agent 1 has only been given item 7. To ensure fairness in the number of items, let's adjust the allocation:

- Swap item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.
- Swap item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.
- Swap item 6 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 8],
    "1": [1, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

Each agent receives four items, and the allocation is adjusted to ensure a fair distribution based on their valuations.
