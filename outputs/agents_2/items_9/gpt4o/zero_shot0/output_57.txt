Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22   9  59  73  86  65  49  80  94
1  52  55  25  64  76  57  10  83  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. In this case, we have two agents and nine items. A possible approach is to assign items in a way that balances the value each agent receives.

Let's calculate a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0's total valuation:**  
   \[
   22 + 9 + 59 + 73 + 86 + 65 + 49 + 80 + 94 = 537
   \]

2. **Agent 1's total valuation:**  
   \[
   52 + 55 + 25 + 64 + 76 + 57 + 10 + 83 + 52 = 474
   \]

To ensure both agents receive a fair share, we can distribute the items based on their respective valuations for each item. A balanced approach might involve giving some high-value items to both agents, rather than all high-value items to one agent.

Here's a potential fair allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 2, 3, 5, 8]
- **Agent 1:** Items [1, 4, 6, 7]

Now, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent based on this allocation:

- **Agent 0's total valuation for allocated items:**  
  \[
  22 + 59 + 73 + 65 + 94 = 313
  \]

- **Agent 1's total valuation for allocated items:**  
  \[
  9 + 76 + 10 + 83 = 178
  \]

This allocation attempts to balance the total value that each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
