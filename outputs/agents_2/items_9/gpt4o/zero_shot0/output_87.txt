Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1   2  29  97  37  70  36  36  16
1  84  15  31  16  88  97  47  42  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One potential approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items based on the highest value difference between the agents.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Calculate the difference in value for each item between the two agents.
2. Allocate the item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.
3. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 84, Agent 0 values it at 1. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 15, Agent 0 values it at 2. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 31, Agent 0 values it at 29. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 values it at 16. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 88, Agent 0 values it at 37. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 97, Agent 0 values it at 70. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 47, Agent 0 values it at 36. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 42, Agent 0 values it at 36. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it at 65, Agent 0 values it at 16. Allocate to Agent 1.

Since Agent 1 has received 8 items and Agent 0 has received only 1 item, we need to adjust to ensure each agent gets a fair share:

- Re-evaluate the allocation to balance the items while considering fairness:
  - Reassign Item 2 to Agent 0 (close value to both agents, only 2 point difference).
  - Reassign Item 6 to Agent 0 (next smallest difference).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair number of items while trying to maximize their individual valuations.
