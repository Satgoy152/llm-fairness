Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  64  29  23   2  48  48  58  91
1  75   5  62  37  65  56  34  11  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a simple greedy algorithm. We'll iterate over each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can fairly allocate the items:

1. Compare the valuations of each item for both agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 75, Agent 0 values it at 15. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 values it at 5. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 62, Agent 0 values it at 29. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 37, Agent 0 values it at 23. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 65, Agent 0 values it at 2. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 48, Agent 1 values it at 56. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Both agents value it at 48. Assign to Agent 0 to balance the number of items.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 11. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 values it at 15. Assign to Agent 0.

After this allocation, each agent has an equal number of items (4 each), and the items are fairly distributed based on their valuations. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
