Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  15  37  81  14  17  38  61  60
1  93  94  66  59  60  96  15  62  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can use a simple algorithm that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 2 agents, each agent should get approximately half of the items, i.e., 4 or 5 items each.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

Agent 0's valuations:  
0: 86, 1: 15, 2: 37, 3: 81, 4: 14, 5: 17, 6: 38, 7: 61, 8: 60

Agent 1's valuations:  
0: 93, 1: 94, 2: 66, 3: 59, 4: 60, 5: 96, 6: 15, 7: 62, 8: 58

To ensure fairness and maximize the value for each agent, we can use a simple greedy approach, assigning each item to the agent who values it more, while keeping track of the total number of items each gets:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (93 vs. 86).
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (94 vs. 15).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (66 vs. 37).
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (81 vs. 59).
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (60 vs. 14).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (96 vs. 17).
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (38 vs. 15).
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (62 vs. 61).
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (60 vs. 58).

After this allocation, Agent 1 receives 6 items, and Agent 0 receives 3 items. To ensure each agent receives approximately half of the items, we need to adjust the allocation.

Let's reassign item 7 from Agent 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it almost as much as Agent 1.

Now, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Agent 1: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5

This allocation gives 4 items to Agent 0 and 5 items to Agent 1, which is a fair allocation given the total of 9 items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
