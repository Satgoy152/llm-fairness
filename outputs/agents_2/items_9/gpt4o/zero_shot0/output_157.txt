Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  82  55  77   0  78  84  60  96
1  12  83  62  54  43  14  91  51  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. A common approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, we use a simple greedy approach to allocate items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents.

Let's calculate the difference in valuations for each item and allocate items to the agent that values it more.

| Item | Agent 0 Valuation | Agent 1 Valuation | Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| 0    | 74                | 12                | 62                             |
| 1    | 82                | 83                | -1                             |
| 2    | 55                | 62                | -7                             |
| 3    | 77                | 54                | 23                             |
| 4    | 0                 | 43                | -43                            |
| 5    | 78                | 14                | 64                             |
| 6    | 84                | 91                | -7                             |
| 7    | 60                | 51                | 9                              |
| 8    | 96                | 76                | 20                             |

Now, let's allocate items to the agents based on the differences:

1. Items with positive differences (Agent 0 values more) are allocated to Agent 0.
2. Items with negative differences (Agent 1 values more) are allocated to Agent 1.

Allocating based on the above criteria, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 4, 6

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
