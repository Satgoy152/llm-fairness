Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78   9  52  75  29  22  68  34  48
1  41  81  28  33  57  61  33  27  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation, ensuring a balanced distribution. One common method is to use a "greedy" approach, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it most, while keeping track of the total number of items each agent receives to ensure a balanced distribution. Hereâ€™s one way to achieve that:

1. Calculate the value difference for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute value of this difference in descending order. This prioritizes items with a larger valuation gap.
3. Allocate each item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item while maintaining a balance between the number of items allocated to each agent.

Let's apply this strategy to allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (78 vs. 41), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (81 vs. 9), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (52 vs. 28), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (75 vs. 33), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (57 vs. 29), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (61 vs. 22), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (68 vs. 33), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (34 vs. 27), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it more (63 vs. 48), allocate to Agent 1.

After this allocation, we have 5 items for Agent 0 and 4 items for Agent 1, which is a reasonable distribution given the valuations. 

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fair distribution of items based on each agent's valuation.
