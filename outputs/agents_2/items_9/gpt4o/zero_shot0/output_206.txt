Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  43  99  30  67  42  12  65  88
1  61   2  73  39  45  50  13  56  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy such as maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. Given there are 9 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally get around 4 or 5 items. We can achieve this by prioritizing items that each agent values more than the other.

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Allocate items to the agent who values them more, while ensuring each agent receives approximately half of the total items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it slightly more (61 vs 60).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (43 vs 2).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (99 vs 73).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (39 vs 30).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (67 vs 45).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (50 vs 42).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (12 vs 13).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (65 vs 56).
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (88 vs 52).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 will get items: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Agent 1 will get items: 0, 3, 5, 6

This allocation gives each agent 4 or 5 items, aiming to maximize the satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
