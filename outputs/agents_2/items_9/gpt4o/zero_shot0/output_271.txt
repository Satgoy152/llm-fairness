Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  58  96  59  51  89  59  43  16
1  97  60  18  28   0  13  14  16  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we must consider their valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring balance in the number of items each receives. Considering there are 9 items, a fair distribution would be 5 items for one agent and 4 for the other.

Here's a possible allocation based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. **Agent 0**'s valuations:  
   - High-value items: 2 (96), 5 (89), 0 (29), 3 (59), 6 (59)  

2. **Agent 1**'s valuations:  
   - High-value items: 0 (97), 1 (60), 8 (24), 3 (28), 2 (18)  

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** receives items: 2, 5, 6, 3, 4  
- **Agent 1** receives items: 0, 1, 8, 7  

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 8, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 five items and Agent 1 four items, aiming to fairly distribute the total valuations.
