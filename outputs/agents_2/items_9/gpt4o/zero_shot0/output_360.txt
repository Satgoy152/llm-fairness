Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  66  71  31  86   1  64  26  81
1  26  56  26  14  38  99  95  66  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a strategy that aims to balance the total valuations for each agent. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve that:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:** First, calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.

2. **Start Allocating:** Allocate items to agents starting with the item that has the largest difference in valuations, prioritizing the agent who values it more.

3. **Check Balance:** After each allocation, check if the difference in total valuations is minimized.

4. **Finalize Allocations:** Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Let's implement this strategy for the given data:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations
- Agent 0's total valuation: \(15 + 66 + 71 + 31 + 86 + 1 + 64 + 26 + 81 = 441\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(26 + 56 + 26 + 14 + 38 + 99 + 95 + 66 + 62 = 482\)

### Step 2: Allocate Items Based on Difference
We will consider the items with the largest difference first and allocate them to the agent who values them more.

- Item 5: Agent 1 values it much higher (99 vs. 1), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it higher (86 vs. 38), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (95 vs. 64), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (71 vs. 26), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (26 vs. 15), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (81 vs. 62), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (66 vs. 26), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (66 vs. 56), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (31 vs. 14), allocate to Agent 0.

### Step 3: Check and Finalize Allocations
Now, let's check the allocations to ensure they are fair:

- Agent 0's items: 4, 2, 8, 1, 3
- Agent 1's items: 5, 6, 0, 7

**Agent 0's total valuation now:** \(86 + 71 + 81 + 66 + 31 = 335\)

**Agent 1's total valuation now:** \(99 + 95 + 26 + 66 = 286\)

The total valuations are fairly close, and each agent has received an integer number of items.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 8, 1, 3],
    "1": [5, 6, 0, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives as closely as possible.
