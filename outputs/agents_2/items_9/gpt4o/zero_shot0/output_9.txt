Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85   1  97   9  51  44  73  39   2
1   5  41  45  66   0  13  10  17  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we will use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent gets from their allocated items, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **List Items by Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: [(97, 2), (85, 0), (73, 6), (51, 4), (44, 5), (39, 7), (9, 3), (2, 8), (1, 1)]
   - Agent 1: [(74, 8), (66, 3), (45, 2), (41, 1), (17, 7), (13, 5), (10, 6), (5, 0), (0, 4)]

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Prioritize higher-valued items for each agent while maintaining balance in the number of items.

3. **Balanced Allocation:**
   - Both agents need to receive 4 or 5 items each to maintain a fairly balanced allocation.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6
   - Agent 1 gets items: 1, 3, 7, 8

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their respective values, while keeping the distribution balanced.
