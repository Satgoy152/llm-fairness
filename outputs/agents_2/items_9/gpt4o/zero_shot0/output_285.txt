Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  25  89  32  53  86  16  71  95
1  38  57  61   3  53  45  60  89  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. In this case, we can aim for each agent to get approximately half of the total items, since there are 9 items, and we can give one agent 4 items and the other 5 items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on each item and allocate the items accordingly.

Agent 0's total valuation for each item:  
- Item 0: 80  
- Item 1: 25  
- Item 2: 89  
- Item 3: 32  
- Item 4: 53  
- Item 5: 86  
- Item 6: 16  
- Item 7: 71  
- Item 8: 95  

Agent 1's total valuation for each item:  
- Item 0: 38  
- Item 1: 57  
- Item 2: 61  
- Item 3: 3  
- Item 4: 53  
- Item 5: 45  
- Item 6: 60  
- Item 7: 89  
- Item 8: 56  

To maximize the total value for each agent, we can compare the relative valuation each agent places on each item and allocate based on the highest value.

1. Compare items based on their valuations:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (80 vs. 38).
   - Item 1: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (57 vs. 25).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (89 vs. 61).
   - Item 3: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (32 vs. 3).
   - Item 4: Both agents have the same valuation (53 vs. 53).
   - Item 5: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (86 vs. 45).
   - Item 6: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (60 vs. 16).
   - Item 7: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (89 vs. 71).
   - Item 8: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (95 vs. 56).

2. Allocate items to maximize each agent's total value:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3, 5, 8
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 6, 7

Let's ensure that each agent gets a fair number of items. Given the current allocation, Agent 0 has 5 items, and Agent 1 has 4 items. This allocation can be considered fair under these constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
