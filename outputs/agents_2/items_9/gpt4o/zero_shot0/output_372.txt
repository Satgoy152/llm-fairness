Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  22  25  94  27  51  31  83   2
1  59  28  43  39  59  84  88  46  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [59 28 43 39 59 84 88 46 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure each agent maximizes their perceived value based on the given valuations. One common approach is using the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while distributing the items fairly.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they receive the item, and then try to distribute the items to maximize each agent's total valuation.

Here are the valuations:
- Agent 0: [88, 22, 25, 94, 27, 51, 31, 83, 2]
- Agent 1: [59, 28, 43, 39, 59, 84, 88, 46, 74]

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (higher valuation: 94 vs. 39)
2. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (higher valuation: 31 vs. 88)
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (higher valuation: 51 vs. 84)
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (higher valuation: 88 vs. 59)
5. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (higher valuation: 83 vs. 46)
6. Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (higher valuation: 2 vs. 74)
7. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (higher valuation: 22 vs. 28)
8. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (higher valuation: 27 vs. 59)
9. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (higher valuation: 25 vs. 43)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 7],
    "1": [6, 5, 8, 1, 4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and attempts to maximize each agent's total perceived value.
