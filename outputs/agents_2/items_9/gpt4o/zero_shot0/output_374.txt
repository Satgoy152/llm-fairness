Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  95   9  89  91   0  45  44  16
1  40  99  58  97  51  70  34  39  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can employ an approach to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, we aim to distribute the items in a way that balances their total valuations as much as possible.

First, let's calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 80 + 95 + 9 + 89 + 91 + 0 + 45 + 44 + 16 = 469
- Agent 1: 40 + 99 + 58 + 97 + 51 + 70 + 34 + 39 + 60 = 548

Now, let's allocate the items to the agents by considering the highest value each agent has for each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 at 40. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 at 99. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 at 58. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 89, Agent 1 at 97. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 at 51. Allocate to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 at 70. Allocate to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 at 34. Allocate to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 44, Agent 1 at 39. Allocate to Agent 0.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 16, Agent 1 at 60. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation considers each agent's valuations to balance the total values they receive as much as possible.
