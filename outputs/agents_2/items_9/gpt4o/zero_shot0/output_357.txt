Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1  2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40   9  7  27  37  66  93  65  99
1   0  19  3   7  17   9   0   3  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent. First, let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to each item and then try to allocate the items in such a way that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

### Step 1: Analyze the Valuations
- Agent 0 has higher valuations for most items compared to Agent 1.
- Agent 1 has relatively low valuations except for item 8, where Agent 1 values it at 31.

### Step 2: Allocate High-Value Items
We should prioritize allocating high-value items to the agents who value them the most, while trying to balance the total number of items each agent gets.

### Step 3: Allocation Plan
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 0 (because Agent 0 values it at 99, much higher than Agent 1's 31).
- Allocate items 6 and 0 to Agent 0 (as they have high values for Agent 0 and low for Agent 1).
- Allocate items 3, 4, 5, and 7 to Agent 0 since they have higher values for Agent 0 than for Agent 1.
- Allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 1 since they have relatively higher valuations for Agent 1 compared to other items.

### Step 4: Final Allocation
Ensure that the allocation is fair in terms of the total value received by each agent while adhering to the rule that each agent should receive an integer number of items.

### Allocations
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 for a total valuation of 427.
Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2 for a total valuation of 22.
