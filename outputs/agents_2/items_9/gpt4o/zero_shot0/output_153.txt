Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  36  14  41  68  53  59  38  70
1  32  40  25   2   6   0  35   5   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a collection of items that maximizes their total valuation while also trying to keep the distribution as equitable as possible. One common method for achieving such fairness is to use a greedy approach that considers the relative valuations of the items by each agent.

Here's one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring a relatively balanced distribution in terms of the number of items.

Let's work through this allocation:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 75 + 36 + 14 + 41 + 68 + 53 + 59 + 38 + 70 = 454
   - Agent 1: 32 + 40 + 25 + 2 + 6 + 0 + 35 + 5 + 7 = 152

2. Start by allocating each item to the agent who values it the most:

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values at 75, Agent 1 values at 32. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values at 36, Agent 1 values at 40. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values at 14, Agent 1 values at 25. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values at 41, Agent 1 values at 2. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values at 68, Agent 1 values at 6. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values at 53, Agent 1 values at 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values at 59, Agent 1 values at 35. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values at 38, Agent 1 values at 5. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values at 70, Agent 1 values at 7. Allocate to Agent 0.

3. Review the allocations for balance:
   - Agent 0 has 7 items: [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
   - Agent 1 has 2 items: [1, 2]

To balance the number of items more evenly, we can reallocate some items:

- Consider reallocating one item from Agent 0 to Agent 1. Item 6 is a good candidate because Agent 0's valuation (59) is not as high compared to their valuations for other items.

Thus, the revised allocation is:

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 6]

This results in a more balanced distribution of items while considering the agents' valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 6]
}
```
