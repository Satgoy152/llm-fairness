Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  56  27  54  75  87  91  20  60
1  36  81  12   5  90  57  32   5  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the idea of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items. One approach is to use a balanced allocation method where we try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items and then allocate items to balance these totals as much as possible.

### Valuation Table:
```
Agent 0: [59, 56, 27, 54, 75, 87, 91, 20, 60]
Agent 1: [36, 81, 12,  5, 90, 57, 32,  5, 61]
```

### Total Value Calculation:
- Total value for Agent 0: 59 + 56 + 27 + 54 + 75 + 87 + 91 + 20 + 60 = 529
- Total value for Agent 1: 36 + 81 + 12 + 5 + 90 + 57 + 32 + 5 + 61 = 379

### Allocation Strategy:
To balance the allocation, we'll distribute items in a way that aims to equalize the total value received by each agent.

After attempting different allocations to balance the total values, here is a fair allocation of items:

### Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: [0, 1, 3, 5, 6]
- **Agent 1**: [2, 4, 7, 8]

### Resulting Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to provide a balanced distribution of total values based on the individual preferences of each agent.
