Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  14  87  46  71  38   2  55  41
1  53  70  29  88  94  99  44  13  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Let's calculate the total valuations for several possible allocations and try to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as equal as possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: 48, 14, 87, 46, 71, 38, 2, 55, 41
   - Agent 1: 53, 70, 29, 88, 94, 99, 44, 13, 11

2. **Sort Items by the Difference in Valuation:**

   This helps to determine which items are more valuable to one agent compared to the other, potentially leading to a more balanced distribution.

3. **Allocate Items Based on Valuation Differences:**

   - Higher value differences are allocated to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.

4. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Agent:**

   After allocating items, sum the total valuations for each agent to check for fairness.

Let's use this method to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 3, 4, 6

**Total Valuations:**
- Agent 0: 48 + 87 + 38 + 55 + 41 = 269
- Agent 1: 70 + 88 + 94 + 44 = 296

This distribution attempts to balance the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives a reasonably fair distribution of the total valuations between both agents.
