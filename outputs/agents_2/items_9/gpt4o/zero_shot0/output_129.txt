Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58   4  25  20  99  33  40  77  62
1  37  51  43  90  92  12  80  83  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[58  4 25 20 99 33 40 77 62]
 [37 51 43 90 92 12 80 83 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We can use the valuations provided to guide the allocation process.

Let's break down the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has higher valuations for items: 0 (58), 4 (99), 8 (62).
2. **Agent 1** has higher valuations for items: 3 (90), 5 (12), 6 (80), 7 (83).

Now, let's allocate based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

- **Agent 0's allocations**: 
  - Items: 0, 4, 8 
  - Total Valuation: 58 + 99 + 62 = 219

- **Agent 1's allocations**: 
  - Items: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 
  - Total Valuation: 51 + 43 + 90 + 12 + 80 + 83 = 359

This approach ensures that each agent is getting items such that their total valuation is maximized based on the given values.

Final allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
