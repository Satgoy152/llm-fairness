Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  53  90  36  68  96   2   2  24
1  16  25  15  25   3   2  52  22  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations to maximize overall satisfaction.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 48, and agent 1 values it at 16. Allocate to agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 53, and agent 1 values it at 25. Allocate to agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 90, and agent 1 values it at 15. Allocate to agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 36, and agent 1 values it at 25. Allocate to agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 68, and agent 1 values it at 3. Allocate to agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 96, and agent 1 values it at 2. Allocate to agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 2, and agent 1 values it at 52. Allocate to agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 2, and agent 1 values it at 22. Allocate to agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 24, and agent 1 values it at 25. Allocate to agent 1.

Based on this allocation strategy, the result is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that they value more compared to the other agent, maximizing each agent's satisfaction.
