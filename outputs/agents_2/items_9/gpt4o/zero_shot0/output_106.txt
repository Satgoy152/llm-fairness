Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  81  18  72  62  40  60  38  75
1  98  62  77  47  32  27   8  37  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an equal or nearly equal number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item by both agents.
2. Prioritize items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents.
3. Allocate items to the agent who values them more, ensuring that each agent receives an equal or nearly equal number of items.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: |48 - 98| = 50
   - Item 1: |81 - 62| = 19
   - Item 2: |18 - 77| = 59
   - Item 3: |72 - 47| = 25
   - Item 4: |62 - 32| = 30
   - Item 5: |40 - 27| = 13
   - Item 6: |60 - 8| = 52
   - Item 7: |38 - 37| = 1
   - Item 8: |75 - 73| = 2

2. Sort items by the difference in descending order:
   - Item 2: 59 (Agent 1 values more)
   - Item 6: 52 (Agent 0 values more)
   - Item 0: 50 (Agent 1 values more)
   - Item 4: 30 (Agent 0 values more)
   - Item 3: 25 (Agent 0 values more)
   - Item 1: 19 (Agent 0 values more)
   - Item 5: 13 (Agent 0 values more)
   - Item 8: 2 (Agent 0 values more)
   - Item 7: 1 (Agent 0 values more)

3. Allocate items ensuring each agent gets an equal number of items:
   - Agent 1 receives: [2, 0, 1, 8]
   - Agent 0 receives: [6, 4, 3, 5, 7]

Now, we ensure that both agents receive four items each. Let's re-allocate:

- Agent 1: [2, 0, 3, 7]
- Agent 0: [6, 4, 1, 5, 8]

Finally, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4, 1, 5, 8],
    "1": [2, 0, 3, 7]
}
```

(Note: Adjustments might be necessary based on specific fairness criteria, but this allocation keeps the number of items distributed equally while considering the highest valuations.)
