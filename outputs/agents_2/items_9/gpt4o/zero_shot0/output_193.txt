Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  50  20  95  48   4  81  44  12
1  21  91   7  44   4  65  79  17  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm or similar heuristic to balance the total valuation each agent receives. 

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 70 + 50 + 20 + 95 + 48 + 4 + 81 + 44 + 12 = 424
- Agent 1 total valuation: 21 + 91 + 7 + 44 + 4 + 65 + 79 + 17 + 94 = 422

Since the total valuations are close, we will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives a similar total valuation.

One approach is to allocate items based on the highest difference in valuation between the agents for each item, which highlights the item each agent values significantly more than the other. This might not always perfectly balance the valuations but can help distribute the items more fairly.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation that attempts to balance the total valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 5, 8

Let's verify the valuation totals for this allocation:

- Agent 0's total valuation for items [0, 3, 4, 6, 7]: 70 + 95 + 48 + 81 + 44 = 338
- Agent 1's total valuation for items [1, 2, 5, 8]: 91 + 7 + 65 + 94 = 257

This allocation does not balance the valuations perfectly, but it provides each agent with a set of items they highly value.

Finally, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 8]
}
```
