Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  69  52  74  72  24  60  92  41
1  37  84   6  13  54  83  51  88  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to alternate picking the highest valued item for each agent until all items are allocated. Here's how we can do it:

1. List all items with their respective valuations for each agent.
2. Sort the items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents.
3. Allocate items by alternating picks starting with the agent who values the item more.

Here's the allocation process:

- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 92, and Agent 1 values it at 88. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 74, and Agent 1 values it at 13. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 24, and Agent 1 values it at 83. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 69, and Agent 1 values it at 84. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 72, and Agent 1 values it at 54. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 60, and Agent 1 values it at 51. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 4, and Agent 1 values it at 37. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 41, and Agent 1 values it at 22. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 52, and Agent 1 values it at 6. Allocate to Agent 0.

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3, 4, 6, 8, 2],
    "1": [5, 1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations.
