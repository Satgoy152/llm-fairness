Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  37  40  12  32  35  22  83  35
1  14  96  56  96  16  63  88  20  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent gets from their allocated items. This can be approached using a method similar to the "maximum marginal benefit" or "greedy allocation" strategy. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has over all items.
2. Allocate items one by one based on which agent values the item more, ensuring that the overall allocation remains as balanced as possible.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Compare the valuations of both agents for each item.
2. Allocate the item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.
3. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Following these steps, here are the allocations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 at 14. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 at 96. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 at 56. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 at 96. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 at 16. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 at 63. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 at 88. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 83, Agent 1 at 20. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 at 33. Allocate to Agent 0.

After allocating based on the higher valuation, we have:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair number of items.
