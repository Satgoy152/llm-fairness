Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  88  64  87  23  43  32   2  40
1  31  95  59  77  41  88  88  64  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can attempt to ensure that both agents receive a fair share of the total value of all items. One common approach for this type of allocation problem is to use the "Envy-Free" or "Proportional" method, where each agent should receive at least half of the total value of all items based on their valuations.

First, let's calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0's total value: 99 + 88 + 64 + 87 + 23 + 43 + 32 + 2 + 40 = 478
- Agent 1's total value: 31 + 95 + 59 + 77 + 41 + 88 + 88 + 64 + 24 = 567

Next, we'll aim to allocate items so that each agent receives a fair share of their respective total value.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Start by allocating items that have the highest difference in value between the agents, prioritizing the agent who values it more.
2. Continue allocating remaining items while maintaining a balance as close as possible to half the total value for each agent.

Following this strategy, the allocation might look like this:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 at 31. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 at 95. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 at 59. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 at 77. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 23, Agent 1 at 41. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 at 88. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 at 88. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 at 64. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 at 24. Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0: 99 (item 0) + 64 (item 2) + 87 (item 3) + 40 (item 8) = 290
- Agent 1: 95 (item 1) + 41 (item 4) + 88 (item 5) + 88 (item 6) + 64 (item 7) = 376

Both agents receive a fair share of their perceived total value with this allocation.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
