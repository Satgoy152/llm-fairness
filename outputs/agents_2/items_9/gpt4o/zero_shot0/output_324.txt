Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  72  27  35  99  59   5  46  74
1  22  67  86  14  26   7  66  86  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items. One way to approach this problem is to maximize the overall value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

Given the table of valuations, the total value each agent places on all items is as follows:
- Agent 0: 41 + 72 + 27 + 35 + 99 + 59 + 5 + 46 + 74 = 458
- Agent 1: 22 + 67 + 86 + 14 + 26 + 7 + 66 + 86 + 94 = 468

We aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives approximately half of the total value they place on the items. The goal is to allocate items to maximize the value for each agent while ensuring fairness.

Here is one possible fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 6, 7, 8

Calculating the values for each agent:
- Agent 0: 41 (item 0) + 27 (item 2) + 35 (item 3) + 99 (item 4) + 59 (item 5) = 261
- Agent 1: 67 (item 1) + 66 (item 6) + 86 (item 7) + 94 (item 8) = 313

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a substantial value from their perspective, considering the total valuation each agent has for the items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
