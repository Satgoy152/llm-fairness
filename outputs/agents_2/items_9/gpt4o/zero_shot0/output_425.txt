Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  27  27  87  59  18  10  53   2
1  84   7  49  16  26  58  24  29  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will try to balance the allocation by considering the valuations of each item for both agents.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. Start by analyzing the highest valued items for each agent to ensure they receive items that are most valuable to them.
2. Allocate items one by one, prioritizing items that have a significantly higher value for one agent over the other.
3. If some items have nearly equal valuations for both agents, use them to balance the total number of items allocated.

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 84, Agent 0 at 58. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 27, Agent 1 at 7. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 49, Agent 0 at 27. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 at 16. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 at 26. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 58, Agent 0 at 18. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 10, Agent 1 at 24. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 at 29. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it at 43, Agent 0 at 2. Allocate to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and the integer number of items is balanced.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items [1, 3, 4, 7], and Agent 1 receives items [0, 2, 5, 6, 8].
