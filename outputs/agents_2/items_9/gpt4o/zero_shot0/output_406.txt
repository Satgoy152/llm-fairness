Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  58  54  90  69  29  60  50  60
1  37  87  39  26   4  34  47  95  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation of items each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm or a combinatorial optimization method to distribute the items.

Let's consider the valuations of each item by each agent:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 92
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 54
  - Item 3: 90
  - Item 4: 69
  - Item 5: 29
  - Item 6: 60
  - Item 7: 50
  - Item 8: 60

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 37
  - Item 1: 87
  - Item 2: 39
  - Item 3: 26
  - Item 4: 4
  - Item 5: 34
  - Item 6: 47
  - Item 7: 95
  - Item 8: 39

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the following approach:
1. For each item, allocate it to the agent who values it the most.

Following this approach:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 37. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 87. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 values it at 39. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 values it at 26. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 values it at 4. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 29, Agent 1 values it at 34. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 values it at 47. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 values it at 95. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 values it at 39. Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation maximizes the valuation for each agent based on their preferences per item.

Final allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 5, 7]
}
```
