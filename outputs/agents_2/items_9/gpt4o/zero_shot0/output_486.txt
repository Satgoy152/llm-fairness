Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  57  56  20  92  44  78  12  91
1  93  66  21  88  99  58  28  60  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. One approach is to use a method like envy-free allocation or maximizing the total valuation for each agent. For simplicity, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items. 
2. Try to allocate the items to balance the total valuation received by each agent.

Let's calculate and allocate the items accordingly:

Agent 0's total valuation if they received all items:
- \(32 + 57 + 56 + 20 + 92 + 44 + 78 + 12 + 91 = 482\)

Agent 1's total valuation if they received all items:
- \(93 + 66 + 21 + 88 + 99 + 58 + 28 + 60 + 87 = 600\)

Now, let's allocate the items to balance the total valuation:

1. Allocate items based on the highest valuation differences to each agent:
    - Item 4 is highly valued by both agents. Let's allocate it to Agent 1 as it maximizes their valuation.
    - Item 1 is next with high value for Agent 0. Allocate it to Agent 0.
    - Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 1, allocate it to Agent 1.
    - Item 5, allocate it to Agent 1 as it slightly favors Agent 1.
    - Item 8, allocate it to Agent 0.
    - Item 7, allocate it to Agent 1.
    - Item 2, allocate it to Agent 0.
    - Item 3, allocate it to Agent 1.
    - Item 6, allocate it to Agent 0.

The allocations could be:

Agent 0: [1, 8, 2, 6]  
Agent 1: [4, 0, 5, 7, 3]  

Final JSON format for the allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their respective valuations.
