Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  75  99  11  11  24  55  74  71
1  11  97   4  76   2  85  72  23  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 97  4 76  2 85 72 23 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's evaluate the valuation matrix and determine a fair allocation.

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 0: 1
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 99
  - Item 3: 11
  - Item 4: 11
  - Item 5: 24
  - Item 6: 55
  - Item 7: 74
  - Item 8: 71

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 11
  - Item 1: 97
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 76
  - Item 4: 2
  - Item 5: 85
  - Item 6: 72
  - Item 7: 23
  - Item 8: 37

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign items that one agent values significantly more than the other to that agent.
2. Try to balance the total valuation each agent receives.
   
Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Assign Item 2** to **Agent 0** (value: 99 vs. 4)
2. **Assign Item 1** to **Agent 1** (value: 97 vs. 75)
3. **Assign Item 3** to **Agent 1** (value: 76 vs. 11)
4. **Assign Item 5** to **Agent 1** (value: 85 vs. 24)
5. **Assign Item 6** to **Agent 1** (value: 72 vs. 55)
6. **Assign Item 7** to **Agent 0** (value: 74 vs. 23)
7. **Assign Item 8** to **Agent 0** (value: 71 vs. 37)
8. **Assign Item 0** to **Agent 1** (value: 11 vs. 1)
9. **Assign Item 4** to **Agent 0** (value: 11 vs. 2)

This allocation approximately balances the total valuations received by each agent.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 8, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6, 0]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent receives a number of items and the allocation is as fair as possible given the valuation differences.
