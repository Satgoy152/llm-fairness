Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  44  45  27   3  16  86  62  62
1  19  56  49  73  57  44   3  97   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. This approach aims to balance the distribution of value between the agents.

Let's start by examining the valuations for each agent:

Agent 0:
- Items: [10, 44, 45, 27, 3, 16, 86, 62, 62]
  
Agent 1:
- Items: [19, 56, 49, 73, 57, 44, 3, 97, 7]

To achieve a fair allocation, we should ensure that both agents receive approximately equal total value. We can approach this by comparing the valuations of each item and assigning it to the agent who values it more, while keeping track of the total valuation for each agent.

Here's how the allocation might look:

1. Compare the valuation of each item and allocate it to the agent with the higher valuation.
2. Adjust the allocation if necessary to balance the total valuation between agents.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (19 vs 10), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (56 vs 44), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (49 vs 45), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (73 vs 27), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (57 vs 3), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (16 vs 44), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (86 vs 3), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (97 vs 62), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (62 vs 7), allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the allocations:

**Agent 0 receives items**: 6, 8  
**Agent 1 receives items**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7

Now we will present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with a higher total valuation to them, achieving a fair distribution of value.
