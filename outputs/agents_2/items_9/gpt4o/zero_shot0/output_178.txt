Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  81  42  28  26   8  98  16  25
1  11   7  50  68  48  68  39   3  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11  7 50 68 48 68 39  3 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. This approach typically involves analyzing the valuation matrix and making strategic allocations.

Let's analyze the given valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0 valuations: [28, 81, 42, 28, 26, 8, 98, 16, 25]
Agent 1 valuations: [11, 7, 50, 68, 48, 68, 39, 3, 39]
```

To allocate the items in a manner that maximizes the perceived value for each agent, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: High-value items are 1 (81) and 6 (98).
   - Agent 1: High-value items are 3 (68) and 5 (68).

2. **Allocate High-Value Items**:
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 and item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 and item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Compare the remaining items based on each agent's valuation and allocate the items to balance the total value received by each agent.

Following this strategy, we attempt to allocate the items to maximize the total valuation for each agent while keeping the allocations reasonably balanced:

- Allocate the remaining items by comparing the remaining values for each agent.
- Ensure that each agent receives a fair share by alternating or balancing the allocations.

Let's perform the allocations:

- Agent 0: Allocate items `[0, 1, 2, 6, 7]` which are high-value items to Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Allocate items `[3, 4, 5, 8]` to Agent 1, based on their higher valuation for some of these items.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to provide a fair distribution of total value between the two agents based on their valuations.
