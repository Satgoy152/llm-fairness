Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  90  30  68  46  61  38  10  18
1   7  58  14  13  14  81  52  87  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's evaluate the items' values for each agent and distribute them accordingly.

Here are the valuations of each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [45, 90, 30, 68, 46, 61, 38, 10, 18]
- Agent 1: [7, 58, 14, 13, 14, 81, 52, 87, 70]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a strategy that considers both total value and individual preferences. Let's proceed by allocating items to the agents based on the highest difference in valuation.

1. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 90, while Agent 1 values it at 58. The difference is 32, so we allocate it to Agent 0.
2. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 81, while Agent 0 values it at 61. The difference is 20, so we allocate it to Agent 1.
3. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 45, while Agent 1 values it at 7. The difference is 38, so we allocate it to Agent 0.
4. **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it at 87, while Agent 0 values it at 10. The difference is 77, so we allocate it to Agent 1.
5. **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it at 70, while Agent 0 values it at 18. The difference is 52, so we allocate it to Agent 1.
6. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 68, while Agent 1 values it at 13. The difference is 55, so we allocate it to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 52, while Agent 0 values it at 38. The difference is 14, so we allocate it to Agent 1.
8. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 30, while Agent 1 values it at 14. The difference is 16, so we allocate it to Agent 0.
9. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 46, while Agent 1 values it at 14. The difference is 32, so we allocate it to Agent 0.

Now that we've allocated all items, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing their respective valuations.
