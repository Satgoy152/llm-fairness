Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  11  71  99  83  85   7  27  22
1  76  59  39  44  53  47  41  99  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a method called "round-robin" based on agent preferences, or to apply an algorithm such as a "greedy allocation" that assigns items one by one to the agent who values them most, subject to ensuring a balanced number of items.

Given the valuations from the table, let's analyze and allocate:

1. **Agent 0** values items highly: 71 (item 2), 99 (item 3), 83 (item 4), and 85 (item 5).
2. **Agent 1** values items highly: 76 (item 0), 59 (item 1), 99 (item 7), and 47 (item 5).

By sorting the items based on descending value for each agent and attempting a fair allocation, we can proceed as follows:

- **Item 3** (99) is most valued by Agent 0.
- **Item 7** (99) is most valued by Agent 1.
- **Item 5** (85) is highly valued by Agent 0.
- **Item 0** (76) is highly valued by Agent 1.
- **Item 4** (83) is highly valued by Agent 0.
- **Item 1** (59) is highly valued by Agent 1.
- **Item 2** (71) is highly valued by Agent 0.
- **Item 6** (41) is highly valued by Agent 1.
- **Item 8** (22) can be given to either; let's give it to Agent 0 to balance the number of items.

After considering these valuations and aiming for balance, here is a proposed allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 4, 2, 8],
    "1": [7, 0, 1, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, both agents have a reasonable distribution of items they value, and both receive an integer number of items.
