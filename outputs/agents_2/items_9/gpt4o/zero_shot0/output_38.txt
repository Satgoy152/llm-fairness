Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  93  12  68  84  77  63  52  73
1  81  96  84  34  57  41  57  73  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider their valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Attempt to allocate items such that the difference in total value between the two agents is minimized.

Let's proceed with this approach:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Value for Each Agent

- **Agent 0**: 20 + 93 + 12 + 68 + 84 + 77 + 63 + 52 + 73 = 542
- **Agent 1**: 81 + 96 + 84 + 34 + 57 + 41 + 57 + 73 + 28 = 551

### Step 2: Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation

Now let's allocate items based on who values them more:
- Item 0: Agent 1 (81 vs 20)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (96 vs 93)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (84 vs 12)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (68 vs 34)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (84 vs 57)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (77 vs 41)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (63 vs 57)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (73 vs 52)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (73 vs 28)

### Step 3: Adjust to Balance Total Value

- After initial allocation:
  - **Agent 0**: Items [3, 4, 5, 6, 8] = 68 + 84 + 77 + 63 + 73 = 365
  - **Agent 1**: Items [0, 1, 2, 7] = 81 + 96 + 84 + 73 = 334

To balance the allocations, let's swap some items to get closer values:
- Swap Item 7 from Agent 1 to Agent 0, and Item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:
- **Agent 0**: [3, 4, 6, 7, 8] = 68 + 84 + 63 + 52 + 73 = 340
- **Agent 1**: [0, 1, 2, 5] = 81 + 96 + 84 + 77 = 338

### JSON Format Output

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives from their allocated items.
