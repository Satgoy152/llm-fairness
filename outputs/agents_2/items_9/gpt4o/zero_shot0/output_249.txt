Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  46  41  56  88  82  18  32  88
1  40  35  46  78  36  43  32  41  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total valuation. The total valuation for each agent can be calculated by summing up their respective valuations for all items. Then, we aim to distribute the items in a way that balances the total valuation each agent receives.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

Agent 0's total valuation:
\[ 46 + 46 + 41 + 56 + 88 + 82 + 18 + 32 + 88 = 497 \]

Agent 1's total valuation:
\[ 40 + 35 + 46 + 78 + 36 + 43 + 32 + 41 + 77 = 388 \]

Next, we try to allocate items in a way that brings each agent's total valuation as close as possible to half of the total valuation of all items combined.

Total valuation of all items:
\[ 497 + 388 = 885 \]

Half of the total valuation:
\[ \frac{885}{2} = 442.5 \]

Now, we'll allocate items to each agent, aiming to get each one's valuation as close to 442.5 as possible.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 gets items 4, 8, and 5: 
   - Valuation: \( 88 + 88 + 82 = 258 \)

2. Agent 1 gets items 3, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2: 
   - Valuation: \( 78 + 32 + 41 + 40 + 35 + 46 = 272 \)

Notice that the allocation is not balanced yet, so we'll adjust to make it fairer.

After trying different combinations, a balanced allocation is:

Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 4, 6

Now let's calculate their total valuations again:

- Agent 0: \( 46 + 46 + 82 + 32 + 88 = 294 \)
- Agent 1: \( 46 + 78 + 36 + 32 = 192 \)

This allocation is still not perfect, so let's try another different approach:

Agent 0 receives items: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 2, 3

Now let's calculate their total valuations again:

- Agent 0: \( 88 + 82 + 18 + 32 + 88 = 308 \)
- Agent 1: \( 46 + 46 + 41 + 56 = 189 \)

This allocation seems fairer based on the initial attempt to balance the total value. While the allocations might not be perfect, they ensure that both agents receive a fair and integer number of items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```
