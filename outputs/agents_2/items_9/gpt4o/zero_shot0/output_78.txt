Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  78  73  53  26  97  62  91  69
1  59  80  13  61  88  68  27  17  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to balance the total value each agent receives. The goal is to ensure that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is as close as possible.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they receive all items:

- Agent 0: 12 + 78 + 73 + 53 + 26 + 97 + 62 + 91 + 69 = 561
- Agent 1: 59 + 80 + 13 + 61 + 88 + 68 + 27 + 17 + 69 = 482

The total valuation of all items is 561 + 482 = 1043.

An ideal fair allocation would give each agent approximately half of the total valuation: 1043 / 2 â‰ˆ 521.5.

Now let's assign items to agents to achieve a fair distribution:

1. Assign items to Agent 1 that are high in value for them and low in value for Agent 0, and vice versa.
2. Adjust the assignment iteratively to achieve the closest balance to 521.5 for both agents.

A possible fair allocation is:

Agent 0: [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  
Agent 1: [1, 2, 8]

Let's calculate the total valuations for this allocation:

- Agent 0: 12 + 53 + 26 + 97 + 62 + 91 = 341
- Agent 1: 80 + 13 + 69 = 162

This allocation is not balanced, so let's adjust:

Agent 0: [0, 3, 5, 6, 8]  
Agent 1: [1, 2, 4, 7]

Calculate valuations:

- Agent 0: 12 + 53 + 97 + 62 + 69 = 293
- Agent 1: 80 + 13 + 88 + 17 = 198

This allocation still does not meet our goal. Let's try another:

Agent 0: [0, 5, 7]  
Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]

Calculate valuations:

- Agent 0: 12 + 97 + 91 = 200
- Agent 1: 80 + 13 + 61 + 88 + 27 + 69 = 338

This is closer to a fair allocation. A more balanced allocation might look like:

Agent 0: [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]  
Agent 1: [1, 2, 7]

Calculate valuations:

- Agent 0: 12 + 53 + 26 + 97 + 62 + 69 = 319
- Agent 1: 80 + 13 + 91 = 184

Let's finalize with:

Agent 0: [0, 4, 5, 6]  
Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]

Calculate valuations:

- Agent 0: 12 + 26 + 97 + 62 = 197
- Agent 1: 80 + 13 + 53 + 91 + 69 = 306

This is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]
}
```
