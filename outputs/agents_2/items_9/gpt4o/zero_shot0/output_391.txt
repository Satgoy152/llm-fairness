Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88   7  86  49   4  65  89  41  84
1  79  72  99  85  28   0  65  52  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations while trying to distribute items such that each agent gets roughly the same number of items.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [88, 7, 86, 49, 4, 65, 89, 41, 84]
- Agent 1: [79, 72, 99, 85, 28, 0, 65, 52, 21]

We'll allocate items to agents by examining which agent values each item more, while also ensuring that each agent receives approximately half of the items (since there are 9 items, one agent will receive 4 items and the other 5).

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 at 79. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 7, Agent 1 at 72. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 at 99. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 at 85. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 4, Agent 1 at 28. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 at 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 89, Agent 1 at 65. Allocate to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 at 52. Allocate to Agent 1.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 at 21. Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's ensure the allocation is balanced:

Agent 0: Items [0, 5, 6, 8] - 4 items  
Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 3, 4, 7] - 5 items  

This allocation gives each agent a fairly balanced number of items, and each item is given to the agent who values it more, wherever possible.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
