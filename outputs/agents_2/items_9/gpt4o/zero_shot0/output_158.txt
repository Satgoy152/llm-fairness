Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  58  31  62  61   6  43  88  81
1  55  57  70  35  16  13  45  86  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 57 70 35 16 13 45 86 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to ensure that each agent receives a roughly equal total valuation for the items they receive. Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and then try to split the items to balance the total valuations as much as possible.

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0's total valuation**: 72 + 58 + 31 + 62 + 61 + 6 + 43 + 88 + 81 = 502
- **Agent 1's total valuation**: 55 + 57 + 70 + 35 + 16 + 13 + 45 + 86 + 86 = 463

### Allocation Strategy:
To balance the valuations, we will try to allocate items in a way that minimizes the difference between total valuations received by each agent.

1. **Sort items by the difference in valuation**: Calculate the difference between the agents' valuations for each item and sort items by this difference.

2. **Allocate items**: Start allocating items to agents prioritizing balancing the overall valuation.

Let's go with this approach:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it more. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Equal valuation. Allocate to Agent 1 for balance.

### Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives, given the constraints.
