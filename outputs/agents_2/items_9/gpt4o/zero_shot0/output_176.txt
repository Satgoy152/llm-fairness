Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89   6   3  44  14  83  22  53  91
1  32  82  58  24  82  55  71  61  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We can employ a simple greedy algorithm by iterating over the items and assigning each item to the agent who values it more, ensuring each agent gets a balanced number of items.

Let's calculate the allocations:

1. For each item, compare the valuations by the two agents.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the higher valuation.
3. If both agents value an item equally, alternate the assignment to keep the allocation balanced.

Let's go through this step by step:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 89, Agent 1 at 32. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 at 82. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 3, Agent 1 at 58. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 44, Agent 1 at 24. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 at 82. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 83, Agent 1 at 55. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 at 71. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 at 61. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 at 66. Assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. Currently, Agent 0 has 4 items (0, 3, 5, 8) and Agent 1 has 5 items (1, 2, 4, 6, 7). This allocation already respects the integer count requirement. 

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
