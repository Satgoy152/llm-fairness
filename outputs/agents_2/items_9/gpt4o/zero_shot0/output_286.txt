Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  18  91   6  79  77  26  13  61
1  57  57  81  79   9  27   4  97  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 57 81 79  9 27  4 97 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent. One common approach is to use a method similar to the "round-robin" or "envy-free" allocation, trying to balance the overall satisfaction (valuation) each agent gets from their allocated items. 

Here's how we can allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would have if they were assigned all the items.
2. Start assigning items to agents in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while keeping allocations fair.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [97, 18, 91, 6, 79, 77, 26, 13, 61]
Agent 1: [57, 57, 81, 79, 9, 27, 4, 97, 94]
```

Let's allocate the items:

1. Sort the items based on the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent that values it more until all items are allocated.

Here's how the allocation might look:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 values it at 57. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Both agents value at 18, assign to any (e.g., Agent 0).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 values it at 81. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 values it at 79. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 values it at 9. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 values it at 27. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 values it at 4. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 values it at 97. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 94. Assign to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness in terms of the total number of items allocated to each agent. Note that this is one way to fairly allocate the items, and other methods might yield slightly different allocations.
