Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  32  22  61  13  60  78  21  54
1  20  82   3  51  80   8  75  64  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives. Let's calculate the total value for each possible allocation and attempt to distribute the items to achieve a reasonably fair balance.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [73, 32, 22, 61, 13, 60, 78, 21, 54]
- Agent 1: [20, 82, 3, 51, 80, 8, 75, 64, 14]

### Total Valuations:
1. Agent 0 Total: 73 + 32 + 22 + 61 + 13 + 60 + 78 + 21 + 54 = 414
2. Agent 1 Total: 20 + 82 + 3 + 51 + 80 + 8 + 75 + 64 + 14 = 397

### Initial Allocation:
Let's aim to give each agent approximately half of the total value.

#### Allocation Strategy:
1. Start by allocating high-value items to balance the total valuation between agents.
2. Adjust the allocation by swapping items to achieve a more balanced distribution.

#### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 3, 5, 6, 8]
  - Value: 73 + 61 + 60 + 78 + 54 = 326
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 4, 7]
  - Value: 82 + 3 + 80 + 64 = 229

#### Adjusted Allocation for Fairness:
To better balance the total value, let's adjust the allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 5, 8]
  - Value: 73 + 60 + 54 = 187
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]
  - Value: 82 + 3 + 51 + 80 + 75 + 64 = 355

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure each agent receives a fair share of the total value based on their individual valuations.
