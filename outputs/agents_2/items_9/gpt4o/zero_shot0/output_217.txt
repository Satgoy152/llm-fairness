Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  52  15  26  78   6  35  52  28
1  48  52  54  93  93  94  14  54  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0's Total Valuation:**  
   - Highest value items: 4 (78), 0 (73), 7 (52), 1 (52)
   - Total: 78 + 73 + 52 + 52 = 255

2. **Agent 1's Total Valuation:**  
   - Highest value items: 8 (97), 5 (94), 4 (93), 3 (93)
   - Total: 97 + 94 + 93 + 93 = 377

Based on this approach, here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

In this allocation, both agents receive items that maximize their valuations based on the available data, ensuring a fair distribution.
