Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  76  20  43   4  83  80   7  18
1  52   4  11  27  95  64  76  46  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to balance the total valuation of items assigned to each agent. Here's one possible allocation that achieves this balance:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 76 + 76 + 20 + 43 + 4 + 83 + 80 + 7 + 18 = 407
   - Agent 1: 52 + 4 + 11 + 27 + 95 + 64 + 76 + 46 + 56 = 431

2. Allocate items to achieve a fair distribution of total value between the agents:
   - Assign high-value items to the agent who values them more, while keeping the overall distribution balanced.

Here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 3, 5, 8]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 76 + 76 + 43 + 83 + 18 = 296
- Agent 1: [2, 4, 6, 7]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 11 + 95 + 76 + 46 = 228

In this allocation, the total valuation is reasonably balanced between the two agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5, 8],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
