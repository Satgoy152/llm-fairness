Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  28  37   8  70  56  22  93  39
1  64  78  98  31  23  76  85  88  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim for an allocation that maximizes the total value each agent receives. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to maximize fairness and total value received by each agent.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 41 + 28 + 37 + 8 + 70 + 56 + 22 + 93 + 39 = 394
- Agent 1: 64 + 78 + 98 + 31 + 23 + 76 + 85 + 88 + 65 = 608

Now, let's allocate the items to attempt to minimize the difference in total value received by each agent:

1. Sort items by the difference in valuations between the two agents, prioritizing items where one agent values it significantly more than the other. This is calculated by taking the absolute difference between the two agents' valuations for each item.

Items sorted by difference in valuations:

- Item 2: |98 - 37| = 61
- Item 7: |88 - 93| = 5
- Item 1: |78 - 28| = 50
- Item 6: |85 - 22| = 63
- Item 5: |76 - 56| = 20
- Item 0: |64 - 41| = 23
- Item 3: |31 - 8| = 23
- Item 8: |65 - 39| = 26
- Item 4: |23 - 70| = 47

2. Allocate items based on the sorted priority so that each agent receives a fair share of total value:

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 4, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 6, 8]

Let's check the total value each agent receives with this allocation:

- Agent 0: 41 (Item 0) + 8 (Item 3) + 70 (Item 4) + 56 (Item 5) + 93 (Item 7) = 268
- Agent 1: 78 (Item 1) + 98 (Item 2) + 85 (Item 6) + 65 (Item 8) = 326

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives, based on their individual item valuations.
