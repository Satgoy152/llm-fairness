Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  51  18  86  18  95  64  51  38
1  21  23  50  74  30  33  83  31  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One potential approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, provided it balances the total number of items each agent receives.

Let's start by evaluating the agents' valuations for each item and then allocate the items accordingly:

### Agent 0 Valuations:
- Item 0: 64
- Item 1: 51
- Item 2: 18
- Item 3: 86
- Item 4: 18
- Item 5: 95
- Item 6: 64
- Item 7: 51
- Item 8: 38

### Agent 1 Valuations:
- Item 0: 21
- Item 1: 23
- Item 2: 50
- Item 3: 74
- Item 4: 30
- Item 5: 33
- Item 6: 83
- Item 7: 31
- Item 8: 98

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 (64) > Agent 1 (21) — Assign to Agent 0
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 (51) > Agent 1 (23) — Assign to Agent 0
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 (50) > Agent 0 (18) — Assign to Agent 1
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 (86) > Agent 1 (74) — Assign to Agent 0
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 (30) > Agent 0 (18) — Assign to Agent 1
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 (95) > Agent 1 (33) — Assign to Agent 0
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 (83) > Agent 0 (64) — Assign to Agent 1
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 (51) > Agent 1 (31) — Assign to Agent 0
9. **Item 8**: Agent 1 (98) > Agent 0 (38) — Assign to Agent 1

After allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4, 6, 8]

Finally, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 8]
}
```
