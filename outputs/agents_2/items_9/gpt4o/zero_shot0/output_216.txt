Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  50  25  10  23  65  36  92  14
1  37  31  88  96  32  31  83  69  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[36 50 25 10 23 65 36 92 14]
 [37 31 88 96 32 31 83 69 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and try to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Let's calculate the total valuation each agent would get if we allocate the items optimally.

Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **List the valuations:**

   Agent 0: [36, 50, 25, 10, 23, 65, 36, 92, 14]

   Agent 1: [37, 31, 88, 96, 32, 31, 83, 69, 17]

2. **Evaluate each item by comparing the valuations for both agents.**

3. **Allocate the items:**

   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it slightly higher (37 vs 36), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it higher (50 vs 31), allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it much higher (88 vs 25), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it much higher (96 vs 10), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it slightly higher (32 vs 23), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it much higher (65 vs 31), allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it higher (83 vs 36), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it higher (92 vs 69), allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it slightly higher (14 vs 17), allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Final allocations:**

   - Agent 0: Items [1, 5, 7]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]

5. **Check total valuation for each agent to ensure fairness.**

   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 50 + 65 + 92 = 207
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 37 + 88 + 96 + 32 + 83 + 17 = 353

Both agents receive all the items, and the allocation attempts to balance the overall valuations each agent receives given their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive an integer number of items, with a focus on maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations of the items.
