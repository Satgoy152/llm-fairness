Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  30  65  11  33  72  10  26  81
1  74  92  92  53  39  35  76  33  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize their total valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: For each item, determine which agent values it more.
2. **Allocate Items**: Assign each item to the agent that has the higher valuation for it.

Let's evaluate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 at 74. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 30, Agent 1 at 92. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 at 92. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 11, Agent 1 at 53. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 33, Agent 1 at 39. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 at 35. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 10, Agent 1 at 76. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 at 33. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 at 85. Assign to Agent 1.

Based on this evaluation, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives an integer number of items, and the items are distributed in a way that each item is given to the agent who values it more.
