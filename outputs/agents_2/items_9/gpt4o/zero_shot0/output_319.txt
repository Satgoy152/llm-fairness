Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7  8
0  53  99  45  53  24  78  81  97  8
1  50  42  56  65  76  84  61  54  2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring both agents get roughly the same number of items. There are 9 items, so one agent will receive 5 items and the other will receive 4 items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent places on all items:**
   - Agent 0: 53 + 99 + 45 + 53 + 24 + 78 + 81 + 97 + 8 = 538
   - Agent 1: 50 + 42 + 56 + 65 + 76 + 84 + 61 + 54 + 2 = 490

2. **Allocate items based on maximum individual valuations:**
   - Start by giving each agent the items they value the most, ensuring that both agents get an approximately equal number of items.

3. **Allocate items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (99), so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most (84), so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Next highest for Agent 0 is item 7 (97), so allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
   - Next highest for Agent 1 is item 4 (76), so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0's next highest is item 6 (81), allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's next highest is item 3 (65), allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0's next highest is item 5 (78), but it is already allocated to Agent 1, so choose the next highest available, item 0 (53), allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's next highest is item 0 (50), but it is already allocated to Agent 0, so choose the next highest available, item 2 (56), allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0's next highest is item 3 (53), but it is already allocated to Agent 1, so choose the next highest available, item 2 (45), allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's next highest available is item 6 (61), but it is already allocated to Agent 0, so choose the next highest available, item 7 (54), allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0's next highest is item 4 (24), allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's next highest available is item 8 (2), allocate item 8 to Agent 1.

4. **Final Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]
   - Agent 1: [3, 5, 7, 8]

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [3, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
