Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4  5   6   7   8
0  81  94  26  12  12  0  50  72  18
1  54  46  89  25  96  7  48  19   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll try to distribute the items so that both agents are satisfied with their allocations.

Let's start by looking at each agent's valuations for the items:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [81, 94, 26, 12, 12, 0, 50, 72, 18]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [54, 46, 89, 25, 96, 7, 48, 19, 9]

We'll attempt to allocate the items based on the agents' valuations to maximize their perceived value from the items they receive.

1. **Agent 0** gets the items with the highest values according to their valuation:
   - Item 1 (94)
   - Item 0 (81)
   - Item 7 (72)
   - Item 6 (50)

2. **Agent 1** gets the items with the highest values according to their valuation:
   - Item 4 (96)
   - Item 2 (89)
   - Item 3 (25)
   - Item 5 (7)
   - Item 8 (9)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and tries to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with items they value highly while distributing the total items evenly.
