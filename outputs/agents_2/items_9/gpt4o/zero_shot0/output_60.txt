Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12   5  31  23  77  58  21  39  43
1  47  42  52  62  59   9  13   1  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an equal number of items. Since there are 9 items and 2 agents, each agent should receive 4 or 5 items. Let's try to find an allocation that maximizes the total value for each agent.

Let's first calculate the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 12 + 5 + 31 + 23 + 77 + 58 + 21 + 39 + 43 = 309
- Agent 1: 47 + 42 + 52 + 62 + 59 + 9 + 13 + 1 + 20 = 305

Given these totals, we will aim to distribute the items such that the allocation is fair based on the relative valuations.

A potential fair allocation can be achieved as follows:

1. Allocate items with the highest relative value to each agent.
2. Ensure each agent ends up with either 4 or 5 items.

**Allocation:**

- Agent 0 has higher valuations for items 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Agent 1 has higher valuations for items 0, 1, 2, and 3.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 2, 3]

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation provides a balanced distribution of items based on the valuations provided by each agent.
