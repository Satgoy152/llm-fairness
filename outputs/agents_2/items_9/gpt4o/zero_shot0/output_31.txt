Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  47  82  23  98  63   6  48  15
1  74  27  32  18  27  35  51   9  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall utility while trying to maintain fairness. One approach is to use a method like the "envy-free" allocation or approximate it by ensuring that each agent gets items such that their total valuation is as balanced as possible.

Let's consider the total valuations of each agent for all items and try to balance these so that the allocations are as fair as possible.

Here are the total valuations for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 62 + 47 + 82 + 23 + 98 + 63 + 6 + 48 + 15 = 444
- Agent 1's total valuation: 74 + 27 + 32 + 18 + 27 + 35 + 51 + 9 + 52 = 325

Now, let's allocate items to maximize fairness:

1. Start with the highest valued items for each agent and allocate alternately, attempting to balance their total valuations.

Allocation:
- Agent 0: Valuations for items are generally higher, so to balance, we might need to make sure they don't get all the high-valued items.
  
- Agent 1: Needs to pick some high-value items to balance the total valuation.

Let's allocate:

Agent 0 gets items: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7 (valuations: 62, 82, 98, 63, 48)
Agent 1 gets items: 1, 3, 6, 8 (valuations: 27, 18, 51, 52)

Now, let's ensure each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible:

- Agent 0's total: 62 + 82 + 98 + 63 + 48 = 353
- Agent 1's total: 27 + 18 + 51 + 52 = 148

This allocation provides a reasonable balance given the constraints. Agent 0 has a higher total valuation, but given the differences in item valuations, this is a close fair allocation.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 8]
}
```
