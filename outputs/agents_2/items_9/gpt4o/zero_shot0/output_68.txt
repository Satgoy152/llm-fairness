Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  10  30  72  74  39  92  20  82
1  51  80  86  48  25  72   3  78  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the satisfaction of both agents based on their valuations. One approach is to use the method of "envy-free" allocation, where each agent receives a set of items such that neither agent would prefer to swap their allocation with the other.

Let's evaluate the valuations and attempt to balance the distribution:

Agent 0's total valuation for all items:  
99 + 10 + 30 + 72 + 74 + 39 + 92 + 20 + 82 = 518

Agent 1's total valuation for all items:  
51 + 80 + 86 + 48 + 25 + 72 + 3 + 78 + 23 = 466

To allocate fairly, we aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives with the number of items they get. 

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. Identify high-value items for each agent and allocate them accordingly.
2. Balance the remaining items to ensure a fair division based on the total valuation.

After analysis, a possible fair allocation could be:

Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6  
Agent 1 receives items: 1, 5, 7, 8  

Let's check the valuations for this allocation:

- Agent 0's allocation:  
  Items 0, 2, 3, 4, 6 with valuations 99, 30, 72, 74, 92  
  Total = 367

- Agent 1's allocation:  
  Items 1, 5, 7, 8 with valuations 80, 72, 78, 23  
  Total = 352

This allocation provides a relatively balanced distribution of total valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

The final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
