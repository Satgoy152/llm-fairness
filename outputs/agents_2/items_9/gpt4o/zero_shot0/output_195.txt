Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  23  19  83  61  57  48  53  22
1  19  48  11  51  10  38  74  67  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives, aiming for a fair split based on their given valuations. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify the highest value per agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 89.
   - Agent 1 values item 8 the highest at 82.

2. **Assign each agent their most valued item:**
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
   - Allocate item 8 to agent 1.

3. **Remove the allocated items and reevaluate the next highest values:**

4. **Allocate remaining items to balance total value:**
   - Calculate the total value each agent currently has:
     - Agent 0: 89
     - Agent 1: 82

5. **Remaining items and their values per agent:**
   - Agent 0: [23, 19, 83, 61, 57, 48, 53, 22]
   - Agent 1: [19, 48, 11, 51, 10, 38, 74, 67]

6. **Allocate remaining items to maintain balance:**
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0 (value 83) to boost their total to 172.
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 1 (value 74) to boost their total to 156.

7. **Continue balancing by allocating remaining items:**
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 0 (value 61) to increase their total to 233.
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 1 (value 67) to increase their total to 223.

8. **Allocate remaining items to maintain fairness:**
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 0 (value 57) to increase their total to 290.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 1 (value 48) to increase their total to 271.

9. **Continue allocating remaining items:**
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 0 (value 19) to increase their total to 309.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 1 (value 48) to increase their total to 319.

10. **Allocate the last remaining item:**
    - Allocate item 2 to agent 1 (value 11) to increase their total to 330.

The allocations end up being:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5, 2],
    "1": [8, 6, 7, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items.
