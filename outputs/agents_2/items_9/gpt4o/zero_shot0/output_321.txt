Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  87  50  74  80  36  35  66  26
1  37  98  19  86  22  47  63  70  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use an approach that attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives. One way to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it more, while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.
3. Adjust as needed to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's how the allocation might look:

- For item 0, Agent 0 values it at 98, and Agent 1 values it at 37. Item 0 goes to Agent 0.
- For item 1, Agent 0 values it at 87, and Agent 1 values it at 98. Item 1 goes to Agent 1.
- Follow this process for the remaining items.

After allocation, verify if each agent has received an integer number of items and adjust if needed. Here is a possible allocation based on the valuations provided:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 8]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, and 8.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent while ensuring each receives an integer number of items.
