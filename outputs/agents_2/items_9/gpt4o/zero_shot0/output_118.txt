Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  99  74  17  42   8  50  33  92
1  36   3  76  83  45  74  13  16  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring both agents receive an integer number of items.

Let's first calculate the total valuation for each agent if they receive all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 53 + 99 + 74 + 17 + 42 + 8 + 50 + 33 + 92 = 368
- Agent 1's total valuation: 36 + 3 + 76 + 83 + 45 + 74 + 13 + 16 + 58 = 404

The goal is to split the items between the agents such that the distribution is as fair as possible.

To find an optimal allocation, let's evaluate the items based on the difference in value for each agent and allocate them to the agent with higher valuation for that item:

1. Items where Agent 0 has higher valuation:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (53) vs Agent 1 (36)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (99) vs Agent 1 (3)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (74) vs Agent 1 (76) [Agent 1 slightly higher, but close]
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (8) vs Agent 1 (74)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (50) vs Agent 1 (13)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (33) vs Agent 1 (16)
   - Item 8: Agent 0 (92) vs Agent 1 (58)
   
2. Items where Agent 1 has higher valuation:
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (17) vs Agent 1 (83)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (42) vs Agent 1 (45)

Considering the valuation differences, let's allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Agent 1 gets items: 2, 3, 4, 5

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 53 + 99 + 50 + 33 + 92 = 327
- Agent 1's total valuation: 76 + 83 + 45 + 74 = 278

This allocation is reasonably fair given the constraints and the valuations provided.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
