Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  61  57  28  15  20  80  98   7
1  18  51  72  50  77  86   2  68  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple approach like the "Envy-Free" allocation, which attempts to minimize envy by trying to distribute high-value items evenly across agents.

1. First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 total value: \(12 + 61 + 57 + 28 + 15 + 20 + 80 + 98 + 7 = 378\)
- Agent 1 total value: \(18 + 51 + 72 + 50 + 77 + 86 + 2 + 68 + 16 = 440\)

2. Next, let's sort the items based on the total value each agent assigns to them:

- Item 7: Agent 0 (98), Agent 1 (68), Total = 166
- Item 6: Agent 0 (80), Agent 1 (2), Total = 82
- Item 5: Agent 0 (20), Agent 1 (86), Total = 106
- Item 4: Agent 0 (15), Agent 1 (77), Total = 92
- Item 3: Agent 0 (28), Agent 1 (50), Total = 78
- Item 2: Agent 0 (57), Agent 1 (72), Total = 129
- Item 1: Agent 0 (61), Agent 1 (51), Total = 112
- Item 0: Agent 0 (12), Agent 1 (18), Total = 30
- Item 8: Agent 0 (7), Agent 1 (16), Total = 23

3. Distribute items to balance the total value for each agent as much as possible:

- Allocate high-value items alternately or based on who values them more.

Allocation strategy:
- Give item 7 to Agent 0 (high value for Agent 0).
- Give item 5 to Agent 1 (high value for Agent 1).
- Give item 6 to Agent 0 (high value for Agent 0).
- Give item 2 to Agent 1 (high value for Agent 1).
- Give item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
- Give item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).
- Give item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).
- Give item 0 to Agent 0 (remaining for Agent 0).
- Give item 8 to Agent 0 (remaining for Agent 0).

Final allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [7, 6, 1, 0, 8],
    "1": [5, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
This allocation attempts to balance the perceived values each agent places on the items.
