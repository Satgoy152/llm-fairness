Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  47  38  93  27  92  37  79  51
1  55  83  37  91  83  97  97  41  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate the total valuation for each item by both agents:**

    - Item 0: 19 (Agent 0) + 55 (Agent 1) = 74
    - Item 1: 47 (Agent 0) + 83 (Agent 1) = 130
    - Item 2: 38 (Agent 0) + 37 (Agent 1) = 75
    - Item 3: 93 (Agent 0) + 91 (Agent 1) = 184
    - Item 4: 27 (Agent 0) + 83 (Agent 1) = 110
    - Item 5: 92 (Agent 0) + 97 (Agent 1) = 189
    - Item 6: 37 (Agent 0) + 97 (Agent 1) = 134
    - Item 7: 79 (Agent 0) + 41 (Agent 1) = 120
    - Item 8: 51 (Agent 0) + 13 (Agent 1) = 64

2. **Allocate the items to balance the total value received by each agent:**

    - Start by allocating items with the highest total value to ensure each agent receives their fair share.
    - Balance the allocation by checking the cumulative value received by each agent and adjust to ensure fairness.

3. **Proposed Allocation:**
    - Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 5, 8
    - Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 4, 6, 7

4. **Calculate the total value for each agent:**
    - Agent 0: 19 (Item 0) + 93 (Item 3) + 92 (Item 5) + 51 (Item 8) = 255
    - Agent 1: 83 (Item 1) + 37 (Item 2) + 83 (Item 4) + 97 (Item 6) + 41 (Item 7) = 341

This allocation attempts to balance the interests of each agent, considering that perfect fairness might be difficult due to the discrete nature of item allocation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their individual valuations while distributing all items.
