Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  79  96  68  90  53  95  96  61
1  30  90  94  80  12  44  80  43  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to balance the total value of the items each agent receives. Here is one possible approach to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Try to distribute the items between the agents such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the total valuations:

- Agent 0: 98 + 79 + 96 + 68 + 90 + 53 + 95 + 96 + 61 = 736
- Agent 1: 30 + 90 + 94 + 80 + 12 + 44 + 80 + 43 + 49 = 522

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0, 2, 6, and 7.
- Agent 1 highly values items 1, 2, and 3.

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 3, 8

Now, let's check the total valuation after allocation:

- Agent 0: 98 + 90 + 53 + 95 + 96 = 432
- Agent 1: 90 + 94 + 80 + 49 = 313

This allocation results in a reasonable balance between the two agents. However, further adjustments might be necessary to achieve an even more equitable distribution.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation considers both the total value for each agent and attempts to balance the distribution of highly valued items.
