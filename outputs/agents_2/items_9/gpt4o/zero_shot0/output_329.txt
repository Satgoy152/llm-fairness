Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  35  76  99  59  69  66  71  75
1  19  24  69  22  49  11  21  67  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use the "Greedy Allocation" method, where items are allocated based on the highest value difference between the agents.

To achieve this, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items in descending order based on the absolute difference in valuation.
3. Allocate items to the agent who values them more until each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's perform these calculations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 19. Difference = 73
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 values it at 24. Difference = 11
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 values it at 69. Difference = 7
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 values it at 22. Difference = 77
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 values it at 49. Difference = 10
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 values it at 11. Difference = 58
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 values it at 21. Difference = 45
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 values it at 67. Difference = 4
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 values it at 35. Difference = 40

Now sort the items by the absolute difference:

1. Item 3: Difference = 77
2. Item 0: Difference = 73
3. Item 5: Difference = 58
4. Item 6: Difference = 45
5. Item 8: Difference = 40
6. Item 1: Difference = 11
7. Item 4: Difference = 10
8. Item 2: Difference = 7
9. Item 7: Difference = 4

Allocate items based on the sorted order:

- Agent 0 will get items with higher value to them than to Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Agent 1 will get the remaining items: Items 1, 2, 4, 7

The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 7]
}
```
