Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  87  28  93   7  86  30  15  81
1  73  87   9  38  65  24  42  40  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that considers both the total value each agent assigns to the items and the distribution of items. A common approach is to use a "round-robin" or "greedy" allocation based on each agent's valuation of the items. 

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - 0: 76
   - 1: 87
   - 2: 28
   - 3: 93
   - 4: 7
   - 5: 86
   - 6: 30
   - 7: 15
   - 8: 81

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - 0: 73
   - 1: 87
   - 2: 9
   - 3: 38
   - 4: 65
   - 5: 24
   - 6: 42
   - 7: 40
   - 8: 74

Next, let's sort each item by the total value across both agents and then prioritize allocation based on the higher valuation:

- Item 3: 93 (Agent 0) + 38 (Agent 1) = 131
- Item 1: 87 (Agent 0) + 87 (Agent 1) = 174
- Item 5: 86 (Agent 0) + 24 (Agent 1) = 110
- Item 8: 81 (Agent 0) + 74 (Agent 1) = 155
- Item 0: 76 (Agent 0) + 73 (Agent 1) = 149
- Item 6: 30 (Agent 0) + 42 (Agent 1) = 72
- Item 2: 28 (Agent 0) + 9 (Agent 1) = 37
- Item 7: 15 (Agent 0) + 40 (Agent 1) = 55
- Item 4: 7 (Agent 0) + 65 (Agent 1) = 72

Now, allocate items by giving priority to the agent who values it more:

- Item 3: Agent 0 (93 vs 38)
- Item 1: Either (87 vs 87), let's assign to Agent 0
- Item 5: Agent 0 (86 vs 24)
- Item 8: Agent 1 (81 vs 74)
- Item 0: Agent 0 (76 vs 73)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (30 vs 42)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (28 vs 9)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (15 vs 40)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (7 vs 65)

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, balancing the total across both agents.
