Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  20  87  71  17  73   2  44  84
1  77  96  79  86  27  35  41  49   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. We can use a greedy approach to allocate items based on the highest value difference between the agents for each item.

1. Calculate the value difference for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute value difference.
3. Allocate items to the agent with the higher valuation for each item, keeping track of the number of items allocated to each agent to ensure fairness.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value | Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| 0    | 97            | 77            | 20                             |
| 1    | 20            | 96            | -76                            |
| 2    | 87            | 79            | 8                              |
| 3    | 71            | 86            | -15                            |
| 4    | 17            | 27            | -10                            |
| 5    | 73            | 35            | 38                             |
| 6    | 2             | 41            | -39                            |
| 7    | 44            | 49            | -5                             |
| 8    | 84            | 5             | 79                             |

Sorted by absolute difference:

1. Item 8 (Agent 0)
2. Item 1 (Agent 1)
3. Item 5 (Agent 0)
4. Item 6 (Agent 1)
5. Item 0 (Agent 0)
6. Item 3 (Agent 1)
7. Item 2 (Agent 0)
8. Item 4 (Agent 1)
9. Item 7 (Agent 1)

Allocate the items based on sorted differences:

- Agent 0: Items 8, 5, 0, 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 6, 3, 4, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items while maximizing their total valuation.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
