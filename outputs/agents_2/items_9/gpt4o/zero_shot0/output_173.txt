Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  88  14  63  97   9  78  93  52
1  71  75  42  21  57  82  61  74   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 75 42 21 57 82 61 74  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of the items.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent would get if they received all items:

- Agent 0: 96 + 88 + 14 + 63 + 97 + 9 + 78 + 93 + 52 = 590
- Agent 1: 71 + 75 + 42 + 21 + 57 + 82 + 61 + 74 + 4 = 487

Now, let's allocate the items such that each agent gets a relatively balanced share based on their total valuations:

1. Start by allocating the item with the highest valuation to the respective agent.
2. Continue by allocating remaining items in order of descending valuation, ensuring that both agents receive a fair share.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value = 97).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value = 96).
3. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value = 93).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value = 88).
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value = 82).
6. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value = 78).
7. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value = 75).
8. Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (value = 52).
9. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value = 42).
10. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value = 63).
11. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value = 21).
12. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value = 71).

Given this step-by-step allocation, we can achieve a relatively balanced distribution of items and valuations.

Let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation assigns a fair number of items to each agent while maximizing their respective valuations based on the initial table.
