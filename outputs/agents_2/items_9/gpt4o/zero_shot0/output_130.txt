Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  69  41  88  77  17  35  89  33
1  12  92  26  19  37  48  73  33  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Looking at the valuations, we can use a strategy to alternate picking the highest valued item that hasn't been allocated yet to ensure a fair distribution.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 and 3 at 88, which are the highest values for any items for them. Let's start by giving item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 8 at 94, which is the highest value for any item for them. Let's give item 8 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** now has item 3 as the next highest value at 88. Give item 3 to agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** values item 1 at 92, which is the next highest for them. Give item 1 to agent 1.
5. **Agent 0** has item 4 valued at 77. Give item 4 to agent 0.
6. **Agent 1** values item 6 at 73. Give item 6 to agent 1.
7. **Agent 0** has item 7 valued at 89, which is higher than any remaining item for agent 1. Give item 7 to agent 0.
8. **Agent 1** has item 5 valued at 48. Give item 5 to agent 1.
9. **Agent 0** is left with item 2 valued at 41. Give item 2 to agent 0.

After this allocation, all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 7, 2],
    "1": [8, 1, 6, 5]
}
```
