Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  33  30  60  89  36  62  48  11
1  30  77   1  69  73  39  63  64  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 77  1 69 73 39 63 64 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One approach is to use a method similar to the "Envy-Free" allocation or a "Max-Min Fair" allocation, but since we're dealing with integer allocations and two agents, a simpler approach is to balance the total valuation across both agents.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent would receive if we allocate the items optimally:

1. **Initial Analysis:**
   - Agent 0 values: [97, 33, 30, 60, 89, 36, 62, 48, 11]
   - Agent 1 values: [30, 77,  1, 69, 73, 39, 63, 64, 41]

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Prioritize high-value items for each agent while balancing the overall value.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Since Agent 0 values item 0 significantly higher than Agent 1, allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate items where there is a significant preference difference to the agent with the higher valuation.
   - Balance the remaining items to equalize the total valuation for each agent.

4. **Compute Total Valuations:**
   - Calculate and adjust the allocations to ensure the total valuation is balanced as much as possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 2, 3, 5, 8]
- Agent 1 receives items: [1, 4, 6, 7]

Let's list the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation balances the total value each agent receives, aiming for fairness based on the given valuations.
