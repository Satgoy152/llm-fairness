Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  45  40  98  55  86  91  34  46
1  16  99  90  86  92  99  50  25  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the overall satisfaction or value for each agent, ensuring that the allocation is as balanced as possible.

Let's take a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**  
   - Agent 0: 7 + 45 + 40 + 98 + 55 + 86 + 91 + 34 + 46 = 502
   - Agent 1: 16 + 99 + 90 + 86 + 92 + 99 + 50 + 25 + 92 = 649

2. **Calculate the Proportional Share of Items:**  
   - Total value for all items: 502 + 649 = 1151
   - Agent 0's share: 502 / 1151 ≈ 43.61%
   - Agent 1's share: 649 / 1151 ≈ 56.39%

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start by assigning the items to the agent who values them the most.
   - Keep track of the total value allocated to each agent and adjust to ensure each gets a fair share.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it more (16 vs. 7) → Assign to Agent 1
- **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it more (99 vs. 45) → Assign to Agent 1
- **Item 2:** Agent 1 values it more (90 vs. 40) → Assign to Agent 1
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it more (98 vs. 86) → Assign to Agent 0
- **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it more (92 vs. 55) → Assign to Agent 1
- **Item 5:** Agent 1 values it more (99 vs. 86) → Assign to Agent 1
- **Item 6:** Agent 0 values it more (91 vs. 50) → Assign to Agent 0
- **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it more (34 vs. 25) → Assign to Agent 0
- **Item 8:** Agent 1 values it more (92 vs. 46) → Assign to Agent 1

Now, let's check the allocation:

- **Agent 0's Items:** [3, 6, 7]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 98 + 91 + 34 = 223

- **Agent 1's Items:** [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 16 + 99 + 90 + 92 + 99 + 92 = 488

Agent 0 receives 223, and Agent 1 receives 488. These allocations satisfy the proportions relative to the total value each agent perceives.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
}
```
