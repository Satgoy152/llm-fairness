Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  55  66  49  84  42  43  69   2
1  65  43  85  64  34  79  41  27  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that seeks to balance the total value each agent receives from the items. One common approach is to use a method such as the "envy-free" allocation where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by sorting the items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents, giving priority to the agent with the higher valuation for each item.
2. Allocate items to each agent in a way that balances the total value as much as possible.

Following this procedure, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3, 6, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4, 5, 7]

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent to ensure a fair allocation:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 33 (item 0) + 55 (item 1) + 49 (item 3) + 43 (item 6) + 2 (item 8) = 182
- Agent 1's total valuation: 85 (item 2) + 34 (item 4) + 79 (item 5) + 27 (item 7) = 225

This allocation seeks to balance the total value each agent receives. Now, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 6, 8],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation provides a reasonable balance considering the given valuations, aiming for fairness in the division of items.
