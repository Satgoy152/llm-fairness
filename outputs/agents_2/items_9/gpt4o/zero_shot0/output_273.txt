Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  38  74  79  38  79  28  85  70
1  51  28  71  77  60  39  52   6  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. Since there are 9 items and 2 agents, each agent should receive approximately 4 or 5 items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest value items for each agent and allocate them in a way that balances the total value for both agents.

2. Use a greedy approach to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total value.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 79, so we'll allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 at 77 and item 2 at 71, but since item 3 is already allocated, we'll allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 7 highly at 85, so we'll allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 51, which is the highest remaining value, so we'll allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 5 at 79, so we'll allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 at 60, so we'll allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 8 at 70, so we'll allocate item 8 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 at 52, so we'll allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
- The remaining item is 1, which Agent 0 values at 38 and Agent 1 values at 28. We'll allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Now we have the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 5, 8, 1],
    "1": [2, 0, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total values received by each agent while ensuring each gets an approximately equal number of items.
