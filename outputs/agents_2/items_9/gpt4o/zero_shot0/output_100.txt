Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6   7   8
0  31  26  76  39  89  98  7   7  26
1  21   5  87  69  83  68  2  21  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [21  5 87 69 83 68  2 21 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's follow an approach that attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their highest individual valuations, while trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0's total valuation**: 31 + 26 + 76 + 39 + 89 + 98 + 7 + 7 + 26 = 399
- **Agent 1's total valuation**: 21 + 5 + 87 + 69 + 83 + 68 + 2 + 21 + 21 = 377

Now, allocate items based on the highest individual valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values more (31 vs 21), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values more (26 vs 5), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values more (87 vs 76), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values more (69 vs 39), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values more (89 vs 83), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values more (98 vs 68), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values more (7 vs 2), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values more (21 vs 7), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Both agents value equally (26 vs 21), allocate to Agent 0 for balance.

This allocation results in:
- **Agent 0's items**: [0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8]
- **Agent 1's items**: [2, 3, 7]

Let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the number of items and the total valuation each agent receives.
