Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  77  37   0  75  73  48  79   4
1  89  97  14  60  49   3  56  59  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

1. We will calculate the total valuations for each agent if they were to receive each item.
2. We will use a simple greedy approach, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while keeping track of the number of items each agent has received.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [42, 77, 37, 0, 75, 73, 48, 79, 4]
- Agent 1's valuations: [89, 97, 14, 60, 49, 3, 56, 59, 93]

Now, allocate each item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it higher (89 vs 42)
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it higher (97 vs 77)
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it higher (37 vs 14)
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it higher (60 vs 0)
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it higher (75 vs 49)
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it higher (73 vs 3)
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it higher (56 vs 48)
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it higher (79 vs 59)
9. Item 8: Agent 1 values it higher (93 vs 4)

After assigning items based on these valuations, we ensure the allocation count is balanced. In this case, each agent receives 4 items initially, but there are 9 items, so we adjust:

- Agent 0: initially has [2, 4, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: initially has [0, 1, 3, 6, 8]

To balance, remove one item from Agent 1's list:

- Remove item 6 from Agent 1 (since it's less valuable than item 8 to Agent 1) and give it to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and each item goes to the agent who values it more highly, considering the constraints.
