Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  1  60  12  43  63  99  95  68  15
1  5  79  76  41  98  44  57   0  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction for each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **List the items with their valuations per agent:**

   - Agent 0: [1, 60, 12, 43, 63, 99, 95, 68, 15]
   - Agent 1: [5, 79, 76, 41, 98, 44, 57, 0, 63]

2. **Calculate the total value for each item as the sum of its valuations by both agents:**

   - Item 0: 1 + 5 = 6
   - Item 1: 60 + 79 = 139
   - Item 2: 12 + 76 = 88
   - Item 3: 43 + 41 = 84
   - Item 4: 63 + 98 = 161
   - Item 5: 99 + 44 = 143
   - Item 6: 95 + 57 = 152
   - Item 7: 68 + 0 = 68
   - Item 8: 15 + 63 = 78

3. **Sort items based on their total value to try and balance high-value allocations:**

   - Item 4: 161
   - Item 6: 152
   - Item 5: 143
   - Item 1: 139
   - Item 2: 88
   - Item 3: 84
   - Item 8: 78
   - Item 7: 68
   - Item 0: 6

4. **Allocate items one by one, considering each agent's individual valuation and aiming for equal distribution:**

   - Agent 0 gets items they value more compared to Agent 1, and vice versa, while balancing the number of items:
     - Agent 0: [1, 5, 6, 7]
     - Agent 1: [0, 2, 3, 4, 8]

5. **Check the balance and adjust if necessary:**

   Both agents have received an equal number of items (Agent 0 has 4 items, and Agent 1 has 5 items). However, since the number of items is odd, this is the best balance possible with the given valuations.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4, 8]
}
```
