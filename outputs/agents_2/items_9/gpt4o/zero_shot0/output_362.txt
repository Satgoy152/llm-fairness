Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  70  92  71  71  64  41  45  84
1  61  26  36  53  11  89  17  66  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One potential method to achieve a fair allocation is to use a greedy approach, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it more until all items are allocated.

Here are the steps to allocate the items:

1. List each item's value for both agents.
2. For each item, assign it to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.
3. If both agents have the same valuation for an item, assign it to any agent since it won't impact fairness in terms of value.

Letâ€™s apply this method to the given data:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 at 61. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 at 26. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 at 36. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 at 53. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 at 11. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 at 89. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 at 17. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 at 66. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 at 41. Assign to Agent 0.

Based on these allocations, here's the resulting JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent given the constraints.
