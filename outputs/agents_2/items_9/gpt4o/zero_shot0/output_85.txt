Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  83  95  22   4  96  32  13   7
1   5  54  12  10  79  92  16  98  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent.
2. Try to distribute items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's go through the steps to fairly allocate the items:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations
- **Agent 0:** 16 + 83 + 95 + 22 + 4 + 96 + 32 + 13 + 7 = 368
- **Agent 1:** 5 + 54 + 12 + 10 + 79 + 92 + 16 + 98 + 88 = 454

### Step 2: Allocate Items to Balance Valuations

- We need to allocate items such that both agents have a relatively balanced share of their total valuations.

Let's start allocating:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 5 (96)
   - Item 2 (95)
   - Item 1 (83)
   - Item 6 (32)
   - Total for Agent 0: 306

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 7 (98)
   - Item 8 (88)
   - Item 4 (79)
   - Item 3 (10)
   - Item 0 (5)
   - Total for Agent 1: 368

With the above allocation, Agent 0 has a total valuation of 306, and Agent 1 has a total valuation of 368, which is fairly balanced given the constraints.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2, 1, 6],
    "1": [7, 8, 4, 3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the total valuation of the items.
