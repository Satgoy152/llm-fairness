Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1  2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  48  7  74  55  24  55  17  11
1  90  55  9  13  41  25  47  89  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider a method that ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. A common approach is to use the "envy-free" allocation principle, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 80 + 48 + 7 + 74 + 55 + 24 + 55 + 17 + 11 = 371
- Agent 1's total valuation: 90 + 55 + 9 + 13 + 41 + 25 + 47 + 89 + 61 = 430

Next, we aim to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share of the total value. Let's attempt to allocate the items to balance the valuations:

1. Allocate the items with the highest individual value for each agent first.

For Agent 0:
- Item 0: 80
- Item 3: 74
- Item 4: 55

For Agent 1:
- Item 7: 89
- Item 0: 90
- Item 8: 61

Now let's complete the allocation with the remaining items to balance the total valuations:

For Agent 0:
- Item 1: 48
- Item 5: 24
- Item 2: 7

For Agent 1:
- Item 6: 47
- Item 4: 41

Let's check the total valuation for each agent after this allocation:

- Agent 0: 80 (Item 0) + 74 (Item 3) + 55 (Item 4) + 48 (Item 1) + 24 (Item 5) + 7 (Item 2) = 288
- Agent 1: 90 (Item 0) + 89 (Item 7) + 61 (Item 8) + 47 (Item 6) + 41 (Item 4) = 328

This allocation is not perfectly balanced, but it aims to be fair based on the highest valuations for each agent.

Hereâ€™s the json format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
