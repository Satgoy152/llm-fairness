Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0  1   2   3   4  5   6   7   8
0  39  0  79  79  59  5   6  28  49
1   7  6  81  16  87  9  77  77  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 7  6 81 16 87  9 77 77 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. We aim to distribute the items such that the sum of the values each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's evaluate the valuations and make allocations:

### Agent 0's Valuations:
- Item 0: 39
- Item 1: 0
- Item 2: 79
- Item 3: 79
- Item 4: 59
- Item 5: 5
- Item 6: 6
- Item 7: 28
- Item 8: 49

### Agent 1's Valuations:
- Item 0: 7
- Item 1: 6
- Item 2: 81
- Item 3: 16
- Item 4: 87
- Item 5: 9
- Item 6: 77
- Item 7: 77
- Item 8: 25

We'll allocate the items based on the difference in valuation between the two agents, giving preference to the agent who values the item more.

### Allocations:
1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it more (39 vs 7), so allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it more (6 vs 0), so allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it more (81 vs 79), so allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it more (79 vs 16), so allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it more (87 vs 59), so allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it more (9 vs 5), so allocate to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it much more (77 vs 6), so allocate to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it much more (77 vs 28), so allocate to Agent 1.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it more (49 vs 25), so allocate to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives as much as possible given their respective valuations.
