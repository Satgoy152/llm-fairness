Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  62  99  93  23  41  37  51  32
1  96  30  11  73   0  71  59  30  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's break down the allocation process:

1. **Calculate total valuation for each agent:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: \(63 + 62 + 99 + 93 + 23 + 41 + 37 + 51 + 32 = 501\)
   - Agent 1's total valuation: \(96 + 30 + 11 + 73 + 0 + 71 + 59 + 30 + 84 = 454\)

2. **Allocate items based on maximum utility for each agent:**
   - For each item, assign it to the agent who values it more, unless it results in an unfair distribution.

3. **Assign items:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values more (96 vs. 63), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values more (62 vs. 30), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values more (99 vs. 11), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values more (93 vs. 73), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values more (23 vs. 0), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values more (71 vs. 41), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values more (59 vs. 37), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values more (51 vs. 30), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 8: Agent 1 values more (84 vs. 32), assign to Agent 1.

4. **Check the fairness of allocation:**
   - Agent 0's allocated items: [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
   - Agent 1's allocated items: [0, 5, 6, 8]

5. **Total values received by each agent:**
   - Agent 0's total value: \(62 + 99 + 93 + 23 + 51 = 328\)
   - Agent 1's total value: \(96 + 71 + 59 + 84 = 310\)

Considering the above steps, this allocation is fairly balanced in terms of total value received by each agent. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
