Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  11  60  29  61  12  72   9  38
1  64  20  77  20  99  74   6  59  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82 11 60 29 61 12 72  9 38]
 [64 20 77 20 99 74  6 59 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim for each agent to receive items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring both agents receive an approximately equal number of items. Given there are 9 items, one agent will receive 5 items and the other will receive 4 items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0's valuations: [82, 11, 60, 29, 61, 12, 72, 9, 38]
- Agent 1's valuations: [64, 20, 77, 20, 99, 74, 6, 59, 40]

### Steps to Allocate:
1. **Assign the Highest Valuation Items**: Start by allocating the items with the highest valuations to the respective agents.
2. **Balance Items**: Ensure the number of items allocated is balanced between the agents.

After reviewing the valuations, here is a fair allocation:

- Item 0 (82) to Agent 0
- Item 1 (20) to Agent 1
- Item 2 (77) to Agent 1
- Item 3 (29) to Agent 0
- Item 4 (99) to Agent 1
- Item 5 (74) to Agent 1
- Item 6 (72) to Agent 0
- Item 7 (9) to Agent 0
- Item 8 (40) to Agent 1

This allocation gives Agent 0 four items and Agent 1 five items, but Agent 1's items overall have higher valuations adding more fairness in terms of total value received.

### Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
}
```
