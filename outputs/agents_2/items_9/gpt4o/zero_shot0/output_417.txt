Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  32  67  48  21  18  24  48  85
1  36  22  18  63   8  33  30  62  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm that allocates items one by one to the agent who values it most but also considers the overall balance of total values between agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 36.
   - Agent 1 values it at 36.
   - Allocate to either, let's choose Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 32.
   - Agent 1 values it at 22.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 67.
   - Agent 1 values it at 18.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 48.
   - Agent 1 values it at 63.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 21.
   - Agent 1 values it at 8.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 18.
   - Agent 1 values it at 33.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 24.
   - Agent 1 values it at 30.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 48.
   - Agent 1 values it at 62.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

9. **Item 8**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 85.
   - Agent 1 values it at 13.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the total values:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2, 4, 8] with total value = 36 + 32 + 67 + 21 + 85 = 241
- Agent 1: Items [3, 5, 6, 7] with total value = 63 + 33 + 30 + 62 = 188

This allocation attempts to balance the total values as much as possible under the constraints. Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 8],
    "1": [3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
