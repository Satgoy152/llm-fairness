Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  51  36  33  78  16  46   8  60
1  95   7  28  74  81  55  94  51  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can try to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach to achieve this is to use a method like the "envy-free" allocation or to balance the total value each agent receives as much as possible.

First, let's calculate the total valuations for each item for both agents:

- Agent 0's valuations: [48, 51, 36, 33, 78, 16, 46, 8, 60]
- Agent 1's valuations: [95, 7, 28, 74, 81, 55, 94, 51, 35]

Now, let's allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share. We aim to give each agent a similar total valuation. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Allocate the items based on balanced valuations:
   - Agent 0: [1, 2, 5, 6, 7]
   - Agent 1: [0, 3, 4, 8]

This allocation is determined by balancing the total value:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 51 + 36 + 16 + 46 + 8 = 157
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 48 + 33 + 78 + 60 = 219

While this allocation isn't perfectly balanced, given the constraints, it aims to provide a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 8]
}
```
