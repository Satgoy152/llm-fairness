Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  91  13  96  76  53  90  14  51
1  84  55  42   0  99  45  68  87  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation or an approximation of envy-free allocation. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate each agent's total valuation for some possible allocations and choose one that seems fair.

Here are the item valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0: [74, 91, 13, 96, 76, 53, 90, 14, 51]
- Agent 1: [84, 55, 42, 0, 99, 45, 68, 87, 98]

One possible way to allocate these items is to iteratively assign items based on the difference in valuations for each item between the agents, prioritizing items where there's a significant advantage for one agent.

Let's calculate a reasonable allocation:

1. Sort items by the absolute difference in valuations between the two agents, prioritizing the assignment to the agent who values it more:
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (96) vs. Agent 1 (0)  -> Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (76) vs. Agent 1 (99) -> Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (74) vs. Agent 1 (84) -> Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (91) vs. Agent 1 (55) -> Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (13) vs. Agent 1 (42) -> Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (53) vs. Agent 1 (45) -> Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (90) vs. Agent 1 (68) -> Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (14) vs. Agent 1 (87) -> Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 8: Agent 0 (51) vs. Agent 1 (98) -> Assign to Agent 1

Now let's calculate the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: [3, 1, 5, 6]
- Agent 1 gets items: [4, 0, 2, 7, 8]

Let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [4, 0, 2, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's valuation, considering the difference in their preferences for each item.
