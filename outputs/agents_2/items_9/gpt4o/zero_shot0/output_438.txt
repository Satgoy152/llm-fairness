Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83   9  96  30  74  35  84  90  81
1  60  42  36  67  84  77  52  54  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. One approach is to use the "Envy-Free" allocation method, where each agent should feel they have at least as much value as the other agent for their own allocation.

Given the valuations, we can start by attempting a fair distribution by iterating over the items and assigning them to the agent who values them more, while keeping track of the total value each agent receives.

Here is one possible allocation for this scenario:

1. **Assign items based on higher valuation:**
   - For each item, compare the values each agent has for that item and assign it to the agent with the higher value.

2. **Ensure each agent gets a fair number of items:**
   - Both agents should get a close number of items since there are 9 items in total, each agent should ideally get 4 or 5 items.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 83, Agent 1 at 60. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 9, Agent 1 at 42. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 96, Agent 1 at 36. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 30, Agent 1 at 67. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 74, Agent 1 at 84. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values at 35, Agent 1 at 77. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values at 84, Agent 1 at 52. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values at 90, Agent 1 at 54. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values at 81, Agent 1 at 55. Assign to Agent 0.

Each agent receives:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 6, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 4, 5]

This gives Agent 0 a total value of 434 (83 + 96 + 84 + 90 + 81), and Agent 1 a total value of 292 (42 + 67 + 84 + 77 + 22). 

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
