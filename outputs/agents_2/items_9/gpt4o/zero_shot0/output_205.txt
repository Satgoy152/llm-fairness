Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  24  36  17  46  13  22  87  28
1  40  41  21  61  72  59  30   7  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's start by considering each item's valuation for each agent:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 values it at 40.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 values it at 41.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 values it at 21.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 17, Agent 1 values it at 61.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 46, Agent 1 values it at 72.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 values it at 59.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 30.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 values it at 7.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 values it at 60.

To ensure fairness, we can use a method where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. 

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Allocated to Agent 0 (70 > 40)
2. Item 1: Allocated to Agent 1 (41 > 24)
3. Item 2: Allocated to Agent 0 (36 > 21)
4. Item 3: Allocated to Agent 1 (61 > 17)
5. Item 4: Allocated to Agent 1 (72 > 46)
6. Item 5: Allocated to Agent 1 (59 > 13)
7. Item 6: Allocated to Agent 1 (30 > 22)
8. Item 7: Allocated to Agent 0 (87 > 7)
9. Item 8: Allocated to Agent 1 (60 > 28)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the items based on their valuations.
