Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  10  73  37  73  85  31  97  71
1  30  32  27  35  52  47  54  88  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can follow an approach to maximize the total satisfaction for each agent. This can be achieved using a method like the "maximum weighted matching" in a bipartite graph or a simpler heuristic that ensures each agent receives items based on their valuations.

Let's consider the following allocation method:
1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Assign items to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. We will try to balance the allocation to ensure fairness.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

```
Valuations:
Agent 0: [42, 10, 73, 37, 73, 85, 31, 97, 71]
Agent 1: [30, 32, 27, 35, 52, 47, 54, 88, 74]

Allocation:
Agent 0: Items with higher valuation by Agent 0
Agent 1: Items with higher valuation by Agent 1
```

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (42 vs 30)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (10 vs 32)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (73 vs 27)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (37 vs 35)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (73 vs 52)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (85 vs 47)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (31 vs 54)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (97 vs 88)
- Item 8: Agent 1 (71 vs 74)

Based on the above step, here is the JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items while ensuring that each item is allocated to the agent that values it more, considering fairness and maximizing the overall satisfaction.
