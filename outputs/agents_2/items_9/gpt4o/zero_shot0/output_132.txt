Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  92  47  51  21  54  65  54  96
1  86  72  11  18  68  30  80  93  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent by considering their valuations. One common method for this type of problem is to use the "envy-free" allocation approach, where each agent feels that the items they receive are at least as valuable as the items received by the other agent.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all the items, and then try to distribute the items in a way that fairly balances the total valuations.

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 87 + 92 + 47 + 51 + 21 + 54 + 65 + 54 + 96 = 567
   - Agent 1: 86 + 72 + 11 + 18 + 68 + 30 + 80 + 93 + 93 = 551

2. Allocate items to balance the valuations:
   - Start by giving the highest valued item to the agent who values it most, then proceed to the next highest, ensuring the total valuation remains balanced.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 4, 7, 8

Checking valuations:
- Agent 0: 87 + 92 + 51 + 54 + 65 = 349
- Agent 1: 47 + 21 + 93 + 93 = 254

This allocation is not balanced, so let's adjust:

Revised allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 7, 8

Checking valuations:
- Agent 0: 87 + 92 + 21 + 54 + 65 = 319
- Agent 1: 47 + 18 + 93 + 93 = 251

This allocation still isn't perfectly balanced, but it improves fairness while satisfying both agents' valuations in a relatively equitable manner.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 7, 8]
}
```
