Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  13  19  25  61  24  32  92  75
1  90  36  97  72  54  51  11  80  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One common method is to use a greedy algorithm where we allocate items based on the highest marginal difference in valuation between the two agents.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuations.
3. Allocate each item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.

Let's calculate the differences and sort the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 by 61 (90 - 29).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 by 23 (36 - 13).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 by 78 (97 - 19).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 by 47 (72 - 25).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 by 7 (61 - 54).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 by 27 (24 - 51).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 by 21 (32 - 11).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 by 12 (92 - 80).
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 by 42 (75 - 33).

Now, sort the items based on the absolute difference:

- Item 2: Difference of 78 (allocated to Agent 1)
- Item 0: Difference of 61 (allocated to Agent 1)
- Item 3: Difference of 47 (allocated to Agent 1)
- Item 8: Difference of 42 (allocated to Agent 0)
- Item 5: Difference of 27 (allocated to Agent 1)
- Item 1: Difference of 23 (allocated to Agent 1)
- Item 6: Difference of 21 (allocated to Agent 0)
- Item 7: Difference of 12 (allocated to Agent 0)
- Item 4: Difference of 7 (allocated to Agent 0)

Now let's allocate the items to each agent:

- Agent 0: [4, 6, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]

Here are the final allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
