Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  45  25  97  86  52  69  17  59
1  31  68  97  30  63  69  37  37  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items. One way to approach this is to consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 76 + 45 + 25 + 97 + 86 + 52 + 69 + 17 + 59 = 526
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 31 + 68 + 97 + 30 + 63 + 69 + 37 + 37 + 10 = 442

2. To fairly allocate, we can try to give each agent items such that the sum of their valuations is as balanced as possible.

3. Start by assigning items to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, ensuring each agent receives approximately half of the total items, which is 4 or 5 items each.

Using a greedy approach based on the highest valuation for individual items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (76 vs 31)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (68 vs 45)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (97 vs 25)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (97 vs 30)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (86 vs 63)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (69 vs 52)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (69 vs 37)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (17 vs 37)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (59 vs 10)

Now, we need to ensure each agent receives a fair number of items. Agent 0 currently has 6 items, and Agent 1 has 3 items. We'll reallocate to balance the number of items:

- Reallocate Item 7 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 5, 7

This way, both agents get 4 items each. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 7]
}
```
