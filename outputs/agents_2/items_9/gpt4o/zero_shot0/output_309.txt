Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  57  41  46  49  82   4  32  60
1  42  70  36  35  46  45  81  21  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to balance the total valuations of items each agent receives. This is a simple approach and might not be the optimal solution for every scenario, but it often works well in practice when the number of items is small.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items and then try to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as close as possible.

### Total Valuations
- Agent 0: 44 + 57 + 41 + 46 + 49 + 82 + 4 + 32 + 60 = 415
- Agent 1: 42 + 70 + 36 + 35 + 46 + 45 + 81 + 21 + 31 = 407

### Allocation Strategy
1. Assign items to agents starting from the highest value item for each agent, and alternate assignments to balance the total valuations.

2. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items.

### Allocation
Let's go through the items one by one:

1. Item 5 is worth 82 to Agent 0 and 45 to Agent 1. Assign it to Agent 0.
2. Item 6 is worth 81 to Agent 1 and 4 to Agent 0. Assign it to Agent 1.
3. Item 1 is worth 70 to Agent 1 and 57 to Agent 0. Assign it to Agent 1.
4. Item 8 is worth 60 to Agent 0 and 31 to Agent 1. Assign it to Agent 0.
5. Item 4 is worth 49 to Agent 0 and 46 to Agent 1. Assign it to Agent 0.
6. Item 0 is worth 44 to Agent 0 and 42 to Agent 1. Assign it to Agent 0.
7. Item 2 is worth 41 to Agent 0 and 36 to Agent 1. Assign it to Agent 0.
8. Item 3 is worth 35 to Agent 1 and 46 to Agent 0. Assign it to Agent 1.
9. Item 7 is worth 32 to Agent 0 and 21 to Agent 1. Assign it to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations
After these assignments, both agents have received 5 items each, and the total valuations are as balanced as possible:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
