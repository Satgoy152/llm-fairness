Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0   9  91  42  86  13  76  55  70
1  21  23  22  49  56  23  31  37   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives while distributing the items as evenly as possible. Here is one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Compute the total valuation each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0: 0 + 9 + 91 + 42 + 86 + 13 + 76 + 55 + 70 = 442
   - Agent 1: 21 + 23 + 22 + 49 + 56 + 23 + 31 + 37 + 6 = 268

2. Sort the items by the difference in valuation between the two agents, from largest to smallest.

3. Allocate the items starting with the greatest value difference in favor of the agent who values it more, ensuring that each agent gets an approximately equal number of items and the total valuation is fairly balanced.

Here is a proposed allocation based on the values:

- Items allocated to Agent 0 (who has higher total valuation):
  - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 at 22
  - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 at 56
  - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 31
  - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 at 37
  - Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 at 6

- Items allocated to Agent 1:
  - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 at 21
  - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 at 23
  - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 at 49
  - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 at 23

This results in each agent receiving an approximately equal number of items while maximizing their perceived value.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 5]
}
```
