Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  90  20  30  21   2  10  93  81
1  96  86  65  52  70  54  66   7  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's calculate the total value for each agent based on different allocations and try to balance the distribution as evenly as possible.

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 70  
- Item 1: 90  
- Item 2: 20  
- Item 3: 30  
- Item 4: 21  
- Item 5: 2  
- Item 6: 10  
- Item 7: 93  
- Item 8: 81  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 96  
- Item 1: 86  
- Item 2: 65  
- Item 3: 52  
- Item 4: 70  
- Item 5: 54  
- Item 6: 66  
- Item 7: 7  
- Item 8: 50  

By evaluating the valuations, we can look for a distribution that balances the total value each agent receives. A potential allocation is as follows:

- Assign items with higher valuation differences to the agent who values them more significantly.
- Ensure that each agent receives 4 or 5 items to make the distribution integer-based.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
  - Total value for Agent 0 = 90 + 20 + 2 + 93 + 81 = 286

- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 3, 4, 6
  - Total value for Agent 1 = 96 + 52 + 70 + 66 = 284

This provides a balanced distribution in terms of the total value each agent receives. Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
