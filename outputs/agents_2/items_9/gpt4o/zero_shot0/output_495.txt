Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  88  70  58  54  43  44  86  74
1  24  56  71  58  53  60  58  70  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way we can achieve this:

1. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items**:
   - Agent 0: 88 + 88 + 70 + 58 + 54 + 43 + 44 + 86 + 74 = 605
   - Agent 1: 24 + 56 + 71 + 58 + 53 + 60 + 58 + 70 + 11 = 461

2. **Identify items with the largest difference in valuation between the two agents**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 values it at 24. Difference = 64
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 values it at 56. Difference = 32
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 values it at 71. Difference = 1
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 58. Difference = 0
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 values it at 53. Difference = 1
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 values it at 60. Difference = 17
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 44, Agent 1 values it at 58. Difference = 14
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 values it at 70. Difference = 16
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 values it at 11. Difference = 63

3. **Allocate items to agents based on largest valuation difference favoring the agent with higher valuation**:
   - Agent 0 gets items with the largest positive differences: 0, 1, 8
   - Agent 1 gets items with the largest negative differences or least positive differences: 5, 6, 7
   - Distribute remaining items to balance the total valuation:
     - Give Agent 0 items 3, 4
     - Give Agent 1 item 2

4. **Calculate total valuation for each agent with the proposed allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3, 4, 8] = 88 + 88 + 58 + 54 + 74 = 362
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 5, 6, 7] = 71 + 60 + 58 + 70 = 259

5. **Final allocation**:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 8],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
