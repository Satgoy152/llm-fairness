Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  33  72  50  62  19  69   9  88
1  96  87  58  31  78  54  12  79  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach to achieve this is to use the "greedy" method which involves assigning items based on the highest valuation differences between the agents.

Let's go through the steps:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations between the two agents for each item.
2. Sort the items by the absolute difference in valuations in descending order.
3. Assign each item to the agent who values it more. If the valuations are equal, you can assign the item to any agent.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Valuation differences for each item:
   - Item 0: |96 - 73| = 23
   - Item 1: |87 - 33| = 54
   - Item 2: |72 - 58| = 14
   - Item 3: |50 - 31| = 19
   - Item 4: |78 - 62| = 16
   - Item 5: |54 - 19| = 35
   - Item 6: |69 - 12| = 57
   - Item 7: |79 - 9| = 70
   - Item 8: |88 - 34| = 54

2. Items sorted by absolute difference (descending): 7, 6, 1, 8, 5, 0, 3, 4, 2

3. Assign items:
   - Item 7: Agent 1 (79 > 9)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (69 > 12)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (87 > 33)
   - Item 8: Agent 0 (88 > 34)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (54 > 19)
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (96 > 73)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (50 > 31)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (78 > 62)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (72 > 58)

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [6, 8, 3, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [7, 1, 5, 0, 4]

Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8, 3, 2],
    "1": [7, 1, 5, 0, 4]
}
```
