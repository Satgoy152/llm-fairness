Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  40  59  18  87  76  46  22  84
1  54  98  53  35   8  57  82  35  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that both agents receive a fair share based on their preferences. The goal is to ensure that the allocations are as balanced as possible. Hereâ€™s one way to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Attempt to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as equal as possible.
3. Consider giving items that one agent values significantly more than the other to that agent.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(23 + 40 + 59 + 18 + 87 + 76 + 46 + 22 + 84 = 455\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(54 + 98 + 53 + 35 + 8 + 57 + 82 + 35 + 22 = 444\)

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 4 highly (87), so give item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly (98), so give item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 5 highly (76), so give item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly (82), so give item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 8 highly (84), so give item 8 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (54), so give item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (59), so give item 2 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 7 equally with agent 0, so give item 7 to agent 1.
- For the remaining items, we can balance by giving item 3 to agent 0.

After allocation, the items can be distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives based on their preferences for the items.
