Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  26  33  40  35  77  84  31  60
1  17  96  56  46   7  34  35  94  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17 96 56 46  7 34 35 94 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while keeping the allocation balanced. Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all the items and then make an allocation that maximizes perceived fairness.

First, calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation:
  - 42 + 26 + 33 + 40 + 35 + 77 + 84 + 31 + 60 = 428

- Agent 1's total valuation:
  - 17 + 96 + 56 + 46 + 7 + 34 + 35 + 94 + 39 = 424

Now, let's allocate the items in a manner that attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent. A common strategy is to alternatively assign the highest-value remaining item to the agent who values it more until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Item 6 (value 84 for Agent 0, 35 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 5 (value 77 for Agent 0, 34 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 0.
3. Item 1 (value 26 for Agent 0, 96 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.
4. Item 7 (value 31 for Agent 0, 94 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.
5. Item 8 (value 60 for Agent 0, 39 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 0.
6. Item 3 (value 40 for Agent 0, 46 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.
7. Item 2 (value 33 for Agent 0, 56 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.
8. Item 0 (value 42 for Agent 0, 17 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 0.
9. Item 4 (value 35 for Agent 0, 7 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 8, 0, 4],
    "1": [1, 7, 3, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total perceived value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
