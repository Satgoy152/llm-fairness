Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99   8   8  95  88   7  59  17  52
1  41  59  12  52  86  67  18  64  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total satisfaction for both agents. One approach is to assign items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

Let's evaluate the total value for each agent if they were to receive each item, and then assign items to balance these total values. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 0 (value = 99). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 8 (value = 94). Assign item 8 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 (value = 95). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 4 (value = 86). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5 (value = 67). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 6 (value = 59). Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 7 (value = 64). Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
8. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 1 (value = 8). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
9. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2 (value = 8). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

Now let's see the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2, 3, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 5, 7, 8]

The JSON formatted allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and attempts to maximize the satisfaction based on their individual valuations.
