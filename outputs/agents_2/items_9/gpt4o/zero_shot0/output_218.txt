Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  38  76  19  68  18  63  84  19
1  15  31  92  40  76  96  85  45  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that the total valuation of each bundle is as balanced as possible. Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation for all items:  
  \(9 + 38 + 76 + 19 + 68 + 18 + 63 + 84 + 19 = 394\)

- Agent 1's total valuation for all items:  
  \(15 + 31 + 92 + 40 + 76 + 96 + 85 + 45 + 76 = 556\)

Now, let's aim to distribute the items in a way that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is as close as possible while each receives 4 or 5 items.

To do this, we will prioritize items based on the difference in valuation between the two agents, and attempt to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: \(15 - 9 = 6\)
   - Item 1: \(31 - 38 = -7\)
   - Item 2: \(92 - 76 = 16\)
   - Item 3: \(40 - 19 = 21\)
   - Item 4: \(76 - 68 = 8\)
   - Item 5: \(96 - 18 = 78\)
   - Item 6: \(85 - 63 = 22\)
   - Item 7: \(45 - 84 = -39\)
   - Item 8: \(76 - 19 = 57\)

2. Sort items based on absolute difference for allocation priority:
   - Item 5: 78
   - Item 8: 57
   - Item 7: 39
   - Item 6: 22
   - Item 3: 21
   - Item 2: 16
   - Item 4: 8
   - Item 0: 6
   - Item 1: 7

3. Allocate items to balance valuations:
   - Agent 0 receives items: 1, 2, 4, 7, 0
   - Agent 1 receives items: 3, 5, 6, 8

Calculating total valuations with this allocation:
- Agent 0: \(38 + 76 + 68 + 84 + 9 = 275\)
- Agent 1: \(40 + 96 + 85 + 76 = 297\)

These allocations are balanced considering the total valuation each agent has for the items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 7],
    "1": [3, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
