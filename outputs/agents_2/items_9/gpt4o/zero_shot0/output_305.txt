Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  53  17  13  95  53  46  70   3
1  37  52  49  98   6  55  93  99  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to ensure that the total valuation each agent receives is as balanced as possible, while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the items and allocate them:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations:**  
   - Total: 75 + 53 + 17 + 13 + 95 + 53 + 46 + 70 + 3 = 425

2. **Agent 1 Valuations:**  
   - Total: 37 + 52 + 49 + 98 + 6 + 55 + 93 + 99 + 14 = 403

Now, let's find a fair allocation:

1. **Allocate the highest-valued items to balance total valuations as much as possible:**

Start by assigning items based on the highest valuations for each agent:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (95)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (99)
  
Continue balancing by considering remaining high valuations:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (98)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (93)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (75)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (55)

Review remaining items:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (53)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (49)
- Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (3)

Now, let's check if the allocation is fairly balanced by calculating the total valuation each agent receives:

- **Agent 0 receives:** Items [0, 1, 4, 8]  
  - Valuation: 75 + 53 + 95 + 3 = 226

- **Agent 1 receives:** Items [2, 3, 5, 6, 7]  
  - Valuation: 49 + 98 + 55 + 93 + 99 = 394

This allocation aims to balance the value each agent receives as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
