Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  50  44  95  90  11  10  25   0
1  35  88  78   7  91  52  41  19  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and every item is allocated. A simple way to approach this is to use a greedy strategy, aiming to allocate items to the agent who values them most. 

Let's evaluate the valuations and distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it more (35 vs 22).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it more (88 vs 50).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it more (78 vs 44).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it more (95 vs 7).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it slightly more (91 vs 90).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it more (52 vs 11).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it more (41 vs 10).
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it more (25 vs 19).
9. **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it significantly more (92 vs 0).

Let's consider the alternative allocations to ensure fairness:

- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Agent 0 gets items: 3, 7

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0 a total value of 95 + 25 = 120
- Agent 1 a total value of 35 + 88 + 78 + 91 + 52 + 41 + 92 = 477

This allocation gives much more value to Agent 1. Instead, we try to balance this a bit more:

- Allocate item 4, which is closely valued, to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 as well, as it's relatively less valued by both.

Now, let's reconsider the distributions:

- Agent 0: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Agent 1: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0 a total value of 95 + 90 + 11 + 25 = 221
- Agent 1 a total value of 35 + 88 + 78 + 41 + 92 = 334

This allocation is more balanced. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6, 8]
}
```
