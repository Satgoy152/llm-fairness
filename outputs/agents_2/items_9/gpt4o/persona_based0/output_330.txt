Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  77  25  95  60  10  96   1   2
1   3  94   8  82  74  18  25  30  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the agents, we aim to consider the preferences of each agent and ensure that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation. We can use the concept of envy-freeness as our guiding principle, which suggests that each agent should feel that their share is at least as valuable as the other agent's share according to their own valuation.

Let's break down the valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0's valuations:**  
  Items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  
  Values: [36, 77, 25, 95, 60, 10, 96, 1, 2]  

- **Agent 1's valuations:**  
  Items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  
  Values: [3, 94, 8, 82, 74, 18, 25, 30, 97]  

To achieve a fair division, we need to allocate the items such that the total valuation is balanced for each agent, considering their individual valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items:** 6 (96), 3 (95), 1 (77)
2. **Agent 1's highest valued items:** 8 (97), 1 (94), 4 (74)

We notice that item 1 is highly valued by both agents. However, Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0, so it might be more appropriate to allocate it to Agent 1 to avoid envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Assign items 0, 3, and 6 to Agent 0. These are some of the highest valued items for Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 4, and 8 to Agent 1. These items have higher valuation according to Agent 1's preferences.
- Now, we have 3 items left to allocate: 2, 5, and 7.

Let's see how these remaining items are valued:

- **Agent 0's valuation for items 2, 5, 7:** 25, 10, 1
- **Agent 1's valuation for items 2, 5, 7:** 8, 18, 30

Following a strategy to balance remaining valuations:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (valued at 25 by Agent 0 and 8 by Agent 1).
- Assign items 5 and 7 to Agent 1 (total value for Agent 1 is 18 + 30 = 48, versus 10 + 1 = 11 for Agent 0).

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
