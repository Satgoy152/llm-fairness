Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  57  22  88  15  57  58  91  39
1  37  89  11  39  57  34  71   3  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free, we want to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value the allocation of the other agent. 

Let's consider the total valuation of each agent if they were to receive all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \( 58 + 57 + 22 + 88 + 15 + 57 + 58 + 91 + 39 = 485 \)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \( 37 + 89 + 11 + 39 + 57 + 34 + 71 + 3 + 12 = 353 \)

The goal is to allocate the items such that both agents feel they are getting a fair share considering their valuations.

Let's attempt a manual allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High value items for Agent 0: 7 (91), 3 (88), 0 (58), 6 (58), 1 (57), 5 (57)
   - Let's give Agent 0 items 0, 3, 5, 7

   Total valuation for Agent 0 = \( 58 + 88 + 57 + 91 = 294 \)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High value items for Agent 1: 1 (89), 6 (71), 4 (57), 5 (34)
   - Let's give Agent 1 items 1, 2, 4, 6, 8

   Total valuation for Agent 1 = \( 89 + 11 + 57 + 71 + 12 = 240 \)

Now, let's check if this allocation is fair:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, 5, 7, which they value at 294.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, which they value at 240.

Agent 0 values their allocation more than they would value Agent 1's allocation. Similarly, Agent 1 values their allocation more than they would value Agent 0's allocation, ensuring envy-freeness.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
