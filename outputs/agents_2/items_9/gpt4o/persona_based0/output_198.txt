Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  19  81  40  88  71  12  18  32
1   0  11  38  62  42  95  54   4   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuation.

### Steps to Achieve Envy-Free Allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:**
   - For Agent 0: \(29 + 19 + 81 + 40 + 88 + 71 + 12 + 18 + 32 = 390\)
   - For Agent 1: \(0 + 11 + 38 + 62 + 42 + 95 + 54 + 4 + 9 = 315\)

2. **Determine Fair Share:**
   - Total items = 9
   - Each agent should get a total value close to half of the total valuation of all items, which is \( \frac{390 + 315}{2} = 352.5\).

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - To start, allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations.
   
4. **Adjustments to Reach Fairness:**
   - Swap items if necessary to ensure both agents have valuations close to their fair share.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0's Highest Valuations:**  
  Item 4 (88), Item 2 (81), Item 5 (71)

- **Agent 1's Highest Valuations:**  
  Item 5 (95), Item 3 (62), Item 6 (54)

- **Initial Allocation:**
  - Agent 0: [2, 4, 0] (valuations: 81, 88, 29 = 198)
  - Agent 1: [5, 3, 6] (valuations: 95, 62, 54 = 211)

- **Adjust to Balance:**
  - Swap Item 5 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 and Item 0 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.
  - Now Agent 0: [2, 4, 5] (valuations: 81, 88, 71 = 240)
  - Agent 1: [3, 6, 0] (valuations: 62, 54, 29 = 145)

- **Remaining Items:** Items 1, 7, and 8
  - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1, Item 7 and 8 to Agent 0.

- **Final Allocation:**
  - Agent 0: [2, 4, 5, 7, 8] (valuations: 81, 88, 71, 18, 32 = 290)
  - Agent 1: [3, 6, 0, 1] (valuations: 62, 54, 29, 11 = 156)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their valuations in a way that aims to minimize envy and provide a fair share given the constraints.

{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [3, 6, 0, 1]
