Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  42  36  84  54  43  66  98  57
1  61  33  13  82  74  40  75   7  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 33 13 82 74 40 75  7 59]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division and aim for envy-freeness, we should look for an allocation that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while keeping in mind the total number of items each agent can receive is integral and the combined total is 9.

The table of valuations is as follows:

| Agent | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0     | 94 | 42 | 36 | 84 | 54 | 43 | 66 | 98 | 57 |
| 1     | 61 | 33 | 13 | 82 | 74 | 40 | 75 | 7  | 59 |

We'll use the following approach:
1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate items such that each agent gets the highest value possible while maintaining fairness.
3. Make sure each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are distributed.

### Allocation Steps

1. **Agent 0** tends to have higher valuations for items 0, 3, 6, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** has relatively high valuations for items 4 and 6, but since agent 0 values item 6 highly, agent 1 might need more of the lower-valued items to balance.

By examining the valuations and aiming to maximize the total value received by each agent while keeping the division fair, we can propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 3, 6, and 7
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8

This allocation aims to balance the value each agent receives and ensures all 9 items are allocated.

### Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
}
```
