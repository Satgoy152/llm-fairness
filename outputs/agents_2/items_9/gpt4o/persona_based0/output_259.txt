Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6   7   8
0  60  28  95  62  22  74  8  42  67
1  58  99  60  14  13  51  5  47   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent prefers their allocation based on their own valuations. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Calculate the total value for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: 60 + 28 + 95 + 62 + 22 + 74 + 8 + 42 + 67 = 458
   - Agent 1: 58 + 99 + 60 + 14 + 13 + 51 + 5 + 47 + 3 = 350

2. **Calculate the total value of all items:**
   - Total value = 458 + 350 = 808

3. **Calculate the fair share for each agent:**
   - Fair share for Agent 0 = 458 / 808 ≈ 0.567
   - Fair share for Agent 1 = 350 / 808 ≈ 0.433

4. **Allocate items using the fair share as a guideline:**

   We'll attempt to assign items such that each agent receives items roughly proportional to their fair share of the total value. This will not always be perfect due to integer constraints and the need to allocate all items, but it provides a starting point.

5. **Allocation:**

   To achieve this, let's allocate items by sorting them based on the relative preference of each agent (value per item) and assigning them iteratively while considering the fair share.

   - **Initial Allocation:**
     - Agent 0: [2, 5, 3, 8]
     - Agent 1: [1, 0, 7, 4, 6]

   This allocation gives:
   - Agent 0: Value = 95 + 74 + 62 + 67 = 298
   - Agent 1: Value = 99 + 58 + 47 + 13 + 5 = 222

6. **Final Allocation:**

   Both allocations are fair based on each agent's valuations, and all items have been assigned. The total value of items for each agent is proportional to their fair share.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 3, 8],
    "1": [1, 0, 7, 4, 6]
}
```

This ensures that both agents receive a fair allocation considering their valuations, and all items have been distributed.
