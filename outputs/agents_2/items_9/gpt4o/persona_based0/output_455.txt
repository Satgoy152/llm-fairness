Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6   7   8
0  91  65  57  13  45  26  0  26  51
1  62  78  78  22   8  57  9  80  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 78 78 22  8 57  9 80 19]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the agents, we aim to allocate them such that neither agent envies the other. Since we have two agents and nine items, each agent should ideally receive around half of the total value of all items, or as close to it as possible, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: \(91 + 65 + 57 + 13 + 45 + 26 + 0 + 26 + 51 = 374\)
- Total value for Agent 1: \(62 + 78 + 78 + 22 + 8 + 57 + 9 + 80 + 19 = 413\)

Now, let's try to allocate the items in a way that balances these valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 at 62.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 at 78.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 at 78.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 at 22.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 at 8.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 at 57.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

7. **Item 6:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 at 9.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

8. **Item 7:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 at 80.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

9. **Item 8:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 at 19.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

### Allocations:
The allocations based on the above decisions are:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 4, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]

### Allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible, considering the valuations and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
