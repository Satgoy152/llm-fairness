Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  87  34  85  62  99  24  12  37
1  64  93   9  40  33  65  98  89  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy between the agents. A common approach is to use the Envy-Free algorithm, such as the Adjusted Winner procedure or any other fair division method that applies to discrete items.

Given the agents' valuations, let's attempt to allocate the items in a way that balances their total values as much as possible, ensuring both agents feel they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

### Agents' Valuations

- **Agent 0**: [66, 87, 34, 85, 62, 99, 24, 12, 37]
- **Agent 1**: [64, 93, 9, 40, 33, 65, 98, 89, 98]

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Each agent has different valuations for items. We will start by allocating items that have significantly higher valuations for one agent compared to the other.

2. **Balance Total Value:** Aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as close as possible.

3. **Ensure Complete Allocation:** All 9 items must be allocated.

### Step-by-Step Allocation

- **High-Value Items for Agent 0:**
  - Item 5: Agent 0 values at 99 (vs 65 by Agent 1)
  - Item 3: Agent 0 values at 85 (vs 40 by Agent 1)

- **High-Value Items for Agent 1:**
  - Item 6: Agent 1 values at 98 (vs 24 by Agent 0)
  - Item 8: Agent 1 values at 98 (vs 37 by Agent 0)

- **Balance the Remaining Items:**
  - Allocate remaining items considering total valuation balance:
    - Item 1: Assigned to Agent 1 (93 vs 87)
    - Item 0: Assigned to Agent 0 (66 vs 64)
    - Item 4: Assigned to Agent 0 (62 vs 33)
    - Item 7: Assigned to Agent 1 (89 vs 12)
    - Item 2: Assigned to Agent 0 (34 vs 9)

### Final Allocation

- **Agent 0 gets:** Items [0, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- **Agent 1 gets:** Items [1, 6, 7, 8]

This allocation attempts to balance each agent's total perceived value from their perspective, given their different valuations.

### Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, and all items are distributed.
