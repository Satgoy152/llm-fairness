Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  80  91  44  47  22  61  96  47
1  54   3  11   6  81  23  13  61  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to ensure that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation. This typically involves maximizing each agent's perceived value of their allocated items, while ensuring that both agents receive an approximately equal total value according to their own valuations. 

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 99 + 80 + 91 + 44 + 47 + 22 + 61 + 96 + 47 = 587
- Agent 1's total valuation: 54 + 3 + 11 + 6 + 81 + 23 + 13 + 61 + 81 = 333

The goal is to distribute the 9 items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the total value from their perspective. 

First, let's sort the items by the difference in valuation between the two agents to identify which items each agent values more significantly than the other:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 values it at 54. Difference = 45 (Agent 0)
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 values it at 3. Difference = 77 (Agent 0)
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 values it at 11. Difference = 80 (Agent 0)
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 44, Agent 1 values it at 6. Difference = 38 (Agent 0)
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 values it at 81. Difference = 34 (Agent 1)
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 23. Difference = 1 (Agent 1)
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 13. Difference = 48 (Agent 0)
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 values it at 61. Difference = 35 (Agent 0)
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 values it at 81. Difference = 34 (Agent 1)

Now, let's allocate items in a way to balance these differences and ensure no envy while considering the total value:

- Allocate to Agent 0 the items they value significantly more: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Allocate to Agent 1 the items that are either valued more by them or have lesser difference: 4, 5, 8

Now, let's check the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
  - Total value for Agent 0: 99 + 80 + 91 + 44 + 61 + 96 = 471

- Agent 1 receives items: 4, 5, 8
  - Total value for Agent 1: 81 + 23 + 81 = 185

This allocation gives each agent a significant share of the total value based on their valuations. 

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [4, 5, 8]
}
```
