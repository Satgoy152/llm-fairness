Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  13  79  98  90  94  24  62  52
1   4   3  97   5  52  63  65   1   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that attempts to minimize envy and achieves a reasonable level of fairness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's utility based on their valuations. The goal is to distribute the items such that both agents feel they are receiving a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 20 + 13 + 79 + 98 + 90 + 94 + 24 + 62 + 52 = 532
- Agent 1's total valuation: 4 + 3 + 97 + 5 + 52 + 63 + 65 + 1 + 1 = 291

Now, let's try to allocate the items to maximize fairness. We aim for each agent's allocation to be as balanced as possible based on their total valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Higher total valuation suggests they value items more generally, so they should receive items with higher individual values to balance their perceived utility.
- **Agent 1**: Lower total valuation suggests they are more selective, so they should receive items they value highly to balance their perceived utility.

### Steps for Allocation:

1. **Assign high-value items based on individual agent preferences**:
   - Agent 0 highly values items: 3 (98), 5 (94), 4 (90)
   - Agent 1 highly values items: 2 (97), 6 (65)

2. **Balance the remaining items** based on the remaining preferences to ensure each agent gets a fair share of their perceived value:
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 7, 8

### Final Allocation:

- Assign item 3, 4, 5 to Agent 0 since these items have significantly higher value for them.
- Assign item 2, 6 to Agent 1 due to their high valuation.
- Balance remaining items by alternating based on remaining value preference.

Here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5, 0, 8],
    "1": [2, 6, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give both agents a fair share based on their valuations, with Agent 0 receiving items with high value to them and Agent 1 receiving items they value highly. The remaining items are balanced between the agents.
