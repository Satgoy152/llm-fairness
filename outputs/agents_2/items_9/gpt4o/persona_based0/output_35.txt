Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  91  98  65  20  18  33  95  29
1  67  49   4  10   6  98  95  26  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for envy-freeness, which means each agent should feel no envy toward the other agent's allocation. A common approach for a two-agent scenario is to use the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or similar algorithms to ensure that both agents receive items in a way that maximizes their utility while maintaining fairness.

Let's analyze the valuations and proceed with an allocation:

**Agent 0's valuations:**
- Items: 0 (9), 1 (91), 2 (98), 3 (65), 4 (20), 5 (18), 6 (33), 7 (95), 8 (29)

**Agent 1's valuations:**
- Items: 0 (67), 1 (49), 2 (4), 3 (10), 4 (6), 5 (98), 6 (95), 7 (26), 8 (92)

To create a fair allocation, we can proceed by initially allocating each agent their most valued items, then iteratively balancing the allocation by considering the value differences:

1. **High-Value Items for Agent 0:**
   - Item 2 (98)
   - Item 1 (91)
   - Item 7 (95)
   
2. **High-Value Items for Agent 1:**
   - Item 5 (98)
   - Item 6 (95)
   - Item 8 (92)

3. **Balancing the Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0 gets items 3 (65), 4 (20), 0 (9)
   - Agent 1 gets item 3 (10)

**Allocations:**
- Agent 0 receives items [2, 1, 7, 3, 4, 0]
- Agent 1 receives items [5, 6, 8]

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of their highest-valued items, and the total number of items is correctly distributed.

Finally, the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 7, 3, 4, 0],
    "1": [5, 6, 8]
}
```
