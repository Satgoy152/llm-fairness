Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87   7  38  50  66  45  97  44  58
1  25  52  25  63   2  23  13  88  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we need to carefully assess the value each agent places on each item. 

One approach is to use the envy-free allocation method, which ensures that each agent feels they have received a fair share. A simple way to achieve this is to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, ensuring neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate total valuation for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 87 + 7 + 38 + 50 + 66 + 45 + 97 + 44 + 58 = 492
   - Agent 1: 25 + 52 + 25 + 63 + 2 + 23 + 13 + 88 + 79 = 370

2. Sort items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents, focusing on maximizing the total value to each agent.

3. Allocate items one by one, ensuring that the allocation is as balanced as possible in terms of total value to avoid envy.

Let's allocate the items:

- Items 0 (87 vs 25) and 6 (97 vs 13) have a large difference in favor of Agent 0, so they should be allocated to Agent 0.
- Items 7 (44 vs 88) and 8 (58 vs 79) have a large difference in favor of Agent 1, so they should be allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 3 (50 vs 63) is slightly better for Agent 1.
- Item 4 (66 vs 2) is much better for Agent 0.
- Item 5 (45 vs 23) is better for Agent 0.
- Items 1 (7 vs 52) and 2 (38 vs 25) are better for Agent 1.

After balancing the allocation based on this understanding:

- Agent 0 receives items that maximize their valuation without causing envy.
- Agent 1 receives items that maximize their valuation without causing envy.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 4, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations of the items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]
}
```
