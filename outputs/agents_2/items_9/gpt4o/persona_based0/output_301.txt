Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  69  41  51  60  87  64  87  76
1  78  74  12  48  88  72  82  17  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should try to balance the total value each agent receives according to their valuations.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0's total value across all items: \( 94 + 69 + 41 + 51 + 60 + 87 + 64 + 87 + 76 = 629 \)
- Agent 1's total value across all items: \( 78 + 74 + 12 + 48 + 88 + 72 + 82 + 17 + 65 = 536 \)

Next, we'll attempt to allocate the items so that the total value each agent receives is as close as possible to their proportional share of the total valuation. The total valuation across all items and both agents is \( 629 + 536 = 1165 \).

Agent 0's proportional share of the total valuation is:  
\[ \frac{629}{1165} \approx 0.54 \]

Agent 1's proportional share of the total valuation is:  
\[ \frac{536}{1165} \approx 0.46 \]

To achieve a fair allocation, we aim to give each agent a collection of items such that the total value of their allocations is close to these proportions. Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's allocation**:
   - Choose items with high values from Agent 0's perspective.
   - Allocate items: 0, 1, 5, 7
   - Total value for Agent 0: \( 94 + 69 + 87 + 87 = 337 \)

2. **Agent 1's allocation**:
   - Choose items with high values from Agent 1's perspective.
   - Allocate items: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
   - Total value for Agent 1: \( 12 + 48 + 88 + 82 + 65 = 295 \)

Agent 0's total value is approximately \( \frac{337}{1165} \approx 0.29 \), and Agent 1's total value is approximately \( \frac{295}{1165} \approx 0.25 \). Although these proportions do not match perfectly with their original proportional shares, this allocation aims to balance the agents' satisfaction given the constraint of integer allocations.

Finally, here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6, 8]
}
```
