Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  47  92  26  99  65  16  52  73
1  16  76  24  93  79  70  17  83   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-free allocation of the 9 items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocated items highly and, ideally, no agent envies the other's allocation. 

Let's consider the valuations of each agent:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 0
- Item 1: 47
- Item 2: 92
- Item 3: 26
- Item 4: 99
- Item 5: 65
- Item 6: 16
- Item 7: 52
- Item 8: 73

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 16
- Item 1: 76
- Item 2: 24
- Item 3: 93
- Item 4: 79
- Item 5: 70
- Item 6: 17
- Item 7: 83
- Item 8: 8

Our objective is to allocate the items such that:
1. Each agent receives an integer number of items.
2. The allocation is as fair and envy-free as possible.

One possible solution is to allocate items based on each agent's highest valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 gets:
  - Item 4 (value 99)
  - Item 2 (value 92)
  - Item 8 (value 73)
  - Item 5 (value 65)

- Agent 1 gets:
  - Item 3 (value 93)
  - Item 1 (value 76)
  - Item 7 (value 83)
  - Item 0 (value 16)
  - Item 6 (value 17)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some of their highest-valued items, leading to a fair and relatively envy-free division. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
