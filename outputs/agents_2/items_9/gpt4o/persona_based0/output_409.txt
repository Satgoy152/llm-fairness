Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  11  43  71   3  84  55  36  24
1  10  95  95  46  85  49  96  64  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we want to ensure that neither agent feels envy towards the other. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as the allocation of the other agent.

We can use the method of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives, also known as the max-min fair allocation. This approach focuses on ensuring that the least satisfied agent is as satisfied as possible.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items and then attempt to divide the items such that the agents have similar total valuations for the items they receive.

1. Calculate the total valuations for each agent:

   - Agent 0: 94 + 11 + 43 + 71 + 3 + 84 + 55 + 36 + 24 = 421
   - Agent 1: 10 + 95 + 95 + 46 + 85 + 49 + 96 + 64 + 40 = 580

2. We aim to allocate items such that both agents have a similar total valuation for their allocated items.

To achieve this, we can try the following allocation:

- Allocate items to Agent 0:
  - Items: [0, 3, 5, 6, 8]
  - Valuation: 94 + 71 + 84 + 55 + 24 = 328

- Allocate items to Agent 1:
  - Items: [1, 2, 4, 7]
  - Valuation: 95 + 95 + 85 + 64 = 339

This allocation ensures that both agents have a similar total valuation for their allocated items, thus minimizing potential envy.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 7]
}
```
