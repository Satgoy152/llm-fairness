Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  45  98  57  94  70  70  76   3
1  55  75  80  60  28  72  61  32  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 75 80 60 28 72 61 32 47]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider the valuations of the agents for each item and allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's perceived value while ensuring that the total number of items allocated equals 9.

### Valuations Table:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 85      | 55      |
| 1    | 45      | 75      |
| 2    | 98      | 80      |
| 3    | 57      | 60      |
| 4    | 94      | 28      |
| 5    | 70      | 72      |
| 6    | 70      | 61      |
| 7    | 76      | 32      |
| 8    | 3       | 47      |

### Steps to Allocate:

1. **Identify the High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 has high values on items 0, 2, 4, and 7.
   - Agent 1 has high values on items 1, 2, and 5.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on High Valuations:**
   - Allocate items 0, 2, 4, and 7 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate items 1 and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are 3, 6, and 8.
   - Check the valuations:
     - Item 3: Agent 0 (57), Agent 1 (60)
     - Item 6: Agent 0 (70), Agent 1 (61)
     - Item 8: Agent 0 (3), Agent 1 (47)

   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it slightly more).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 1.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
   - Agent 1: 1, 3, 5, 8

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize individual valuations while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.
