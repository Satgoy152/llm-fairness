Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74   1  49  38  82  13  51  10   9
1  14  95  18  92  70  39  66  36  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use an approach that aims to minimize envy and maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One common method is to use an algorithm that strives for envy-freeness. In this context, a simple approach is to allocate items in a way that each agent's total valuation of the items they receive is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \( 74 + 1 + 49 + 38 + 82 + 13 + 51 + 10 + 9 = 327 \)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \( 14 + 95 + 18 + 92 + 70 + 39 + 66 + 36 + 82 = 512 \)

Agent 1 values the items more overall, so they might end up getting items they value more highly. However, we need to balance the allocations such that each agent receives items whose value to them is approximately equal to half of their total valuation.

Let's use a greedy approach to allocate items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it more, but ensure that each agent ends up with a roughly equal total value according to their own valuation scale.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. Start with the highest valued items for each agent and allocate them, ensuring total allocations are balanced:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (valuation: 95)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (valuation: 82)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (valuation: 92)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (valuation: 74)
- Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (valuation: 82)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (valuation: 66)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (valuation: 49)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (valuation: 39)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (valuation: 10)

Now, let's check the total value each agent has:

- Agent 0's allocated items: [0, 4, 2, 7] with values 74, 82, 49, and 10 respectively. Total = 215
- Agent 1's allocated items: [1, 3, 8, 6, 5] with values 95, 92, 82, 66, and 39 respectively. Total = 297

The allocations ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of allocated items is 9. Given the valuations, this allocation is reasonably fair.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 2, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 8, 6, 5]
}
```
