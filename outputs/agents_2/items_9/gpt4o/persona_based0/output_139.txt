Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  25  21  97  42  73  73   6  91
1  60  70  55  12  18   7  12  32  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. We'll start by evaluating the total valuation of each agent for all items and then proceed to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy.

Agent 0's total valuation across all items:
- Item 0: 28
- Item 1: 25
- Item 2: 21
- Item 3: 97
- Item 4: 42
- Item 5: 73
- Item 6: 73
- Item 7: 6
- Item 8: 91

Sum for Agent 0 = 28 + 25 + 21 + 97 + 42 + 73 + 73 + 6 + 91 = 456

Agent 1's total valuation across all items:
- Item 0: 60
- Item 1: 70
- Item 2: 55
- Item 3: 12
- Item 4: 18
- Item 5: 7
- Item 6: 12
- Item 7: 32
- Item 8: 65

Sum for Agent 1 = 60 + 70 + 55 + 12 + 18 + 7 + 12 + 32 + 65 = 331

Given that Agent 0 values the items more in total, we need to ensure that the allocation is done carefully to ensure both fairness and that each agent feels they are getting a reasonable share based on their valuations.

Let's proceed with a step-by-step allocation:

1. **High-value allocation for each agent**: Begin by assigning high-value items for each agent based on their preference to minimize potential envy.

   - For Agent 0, the highest valued item is Item 3 (97).
   - For Agent 1, the highest valued item is Item 0 (60).

2. **Continue assigning based on relative value**: Assign subsequent items based on where each agent has a relatively higher valuation compared to the other agent.

3. **Ensure integer allocations**: Allocate remaining items to balance the number of items per agent while maintaining as much value satisfaction as possible.

Based on this approach, let's assign the items:

Agent 0 receives:
- Item 3 (97)
- Item 5 (73)
- Item 6 (73)
- Item 8 (91)
- Item 7 (6)

Agent 1 receives:
- Item 0 (60)
- Item 1 (70)
- Item 2 (55)
- Item 4 (18)

Now, let's ensure this allocation is fair:
- Agent 0's total value = 97 + 73 + 73 + 91 + 6 = 340
- Agent 1's total value = 60 + 70 + 55 + 18 = 203

The allocation has been done in a manner that respects each agent's preferences and attempts to minimize envy while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items (5 and 4 respectively).

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6, 8, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```
