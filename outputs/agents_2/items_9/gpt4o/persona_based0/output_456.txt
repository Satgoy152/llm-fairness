Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  27  49  11  77  37  17  99   1
1  22  44  52  97  46  84  33  51  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. A common approach to achieve this is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0's total valuation:** 50 + 27 + 49 + 11 + 77 + 37 + 17 + 99 + 1 = 368
- **Agent 1's total valuation:** 22 + 44 + 52 + 97 + 46 + 84 + 33 + 51 + 53 = 482

Next, we will allocate items so that each agent feels they have received at least half of the total value they assign to all items. This means:

- **Agent 0's fair share:** 368 / 2 = 184
- **Agent 1's fair share:** 482 / 2 = 241

Now, let's try to allocate the items:

1. Start by allocating items that have the highest value for each agent until their fair share is met or exceeded.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure all items are distributed.

**Allocation Strategy:**

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 7 (value 99)
  - Item 4 (value 77)
  - Item 0 (value 50)
  - Total valuation = 99 + 77 + 50 = 226 (exceeds 184)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 3 (value 97)
  - Item 5 (value 84)
  - Item 2 (value 52)
  - Item 8 (value 53)
  - Total valuation = 97 + 84 + 52 + 53 = 286 (exceeds 241)

Finally, let's check the unallocated items and distribute them:

- Remaining items: 1, 6
- Allocate item 1 (highest remaining value for Agent 1) to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures both agents feel they have received a fair portion based on their valuations, and all items are distributed.
