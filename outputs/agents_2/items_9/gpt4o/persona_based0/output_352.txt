Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  79  61  21  76  54  16   1   9
1  71  83  81  84  84  20  12  88  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can utilize the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is considered envy-free if each agent feels they have received the most valuable bundle of items according to their own valuations. Given the table, we need to consider the valuations of both agents and allocate the items in a way that minimizes potential envy.

Here's a simple method to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Rank the items for each agent based on their valuations from highest to lowest.
2. Allocate items one by one, starting from the highest value for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives an approximately equal total valuation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

Agent 0's valuations (descending order):  
1. Item 1: 79  
2. Item 4: 76  
3. Item 2: 61  
4. Item 5: 54  
5. Item 3: 21  
6. Item 6: 16  
7. Item 0: 13  
8. Item 8: 9  
9. Item 7: 1  

Agent 1's valuations (descending order):  
1. Item 3: 84  
2. Item 4: 84  
3. Item 1: 83  
4. Item 2: 81  
5. Item 8: 82  
6. Item 0: 71  
7. Item 5: 20  
8. Item 7: 88  
9. Item 6: 12  

Allocate items to ensure both agents feel they have a fair share:

- Agent 0 gets: Items 1, 4, 6, 0  
- Agent 1 gets: Items 3, 2, 8, 5, 7  

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 79 (item 1) + 76 (item 4) + 16 (item 6) + 13 (item 0) = 184
- Agent 1's total valuation: 84 (item 3) + 81 (item 2) + 82 (item 8) + 20 (item 5) + 88 (item 7) = 355

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items that align closely with their highest preferences, and it minimizes potential envy based on the given valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6, 0],
    "1": [3, 2, 8, 5, 7]
}
```
