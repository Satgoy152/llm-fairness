Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3  4   5   6   7   8
0  36  52  83  99  2  78  95  54  97
1  91  76  55  48  9  77  51   0  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming to ensure envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive while ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's start by examining the total valuations for each item across both agents:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Item 0: 36
   - Item 1: 52
   - Item 2: 83
   - Item 3: 99
   - Item 4: 2
   - Item 5: 78
   - Item 6: 95
   - Item 7: 54
   - Item 8: 97

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Item 0: 91
   - Item 1: 76
   - Item 2: 55
   - Item 3: 48
   - Item 4: 9
   - Item 5: 77
   - Item 6: 51
   - Item 7: 0
   - Item 8: 13

Next, we can consider giving each agent the items for which they have relatively high valuations compared to the other agent.

A possible allocation strategy is:

- Assign items which Agent 0 values significantly higher than Agent 1, and vice versa.
- Try to balance the total value each agent receives.

After analyzing the values, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items with higher values from their perspective: 3, 4, 6, 8.
- Agent 1 receives items with higher values from their perspective: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 3: 99
  - Item 4: 2
  - Item 6: 95
  - Item 8: 97
  - Total value = 293
  
- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 91
  - Item 1: 76
  - Item 2: 55
  - Item 5: 77
  - Item 7: 0
  - Total value = 299

This allocation gives each agent a balanced and fair distribution of items according to their valuations, while keeping the total items allocated to 9 and attempting to minimize envy.

Finally, here is the allocation in the required json format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5, 7]
}
```
