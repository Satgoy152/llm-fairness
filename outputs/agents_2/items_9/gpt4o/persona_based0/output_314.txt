Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  40  49  39  43  42  85  81  91
1  35  91  75  91  36  22  13  65   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will utilize an allocation approach based on maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [31, 40, 49, 39, 43, 42, 85, 81, 91]
- Agent 1 values: [35, 91, 75, 91, 36, 22, 13, 65, 7]

Given these valuations, a potential allocation strategy is to ensure each agent receives items with a total value that maximizes their minimum utility across both agents.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initial Analysis**: 
   - Identify key high-value items for each agent.
   - Items with the highest valuation for Agent 0: Item 8 (91), Item 6 (85), Item 7 (81).
   - Items with the highest valuation for Agent 1: Item 1 (91), Item 3 (91), Item 2 (75).

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign each agent their most valuable items and balance the remaining items to ensure envy-freeness.
   - Maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring the least envy between agents.

3. **Execution**:
   - Assign items to Agent 0: [0, 6, 7, 8]
     - Total value for Agent 0: 31 (Item 0) + 85 (Item 6) + 81 (Item 7) + 91 (Item 8) = 288
   - Assign items to Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     - Total value for Agent 1: 91 (Item 1) + 75 (Item 2) + 91 (Item 3) + 36 (Item 4) + 22 (Item 5) = 315

Both allocations give each agent a fair share based on their valuations, ensuring a reasonable attempt at envy-freeness.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a substantial portion of their valued items, aiming to minimize envy between the agents.
