Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  34  74   5  81  26  15  83  79
1   2  61  51  37  73  96  56  77  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent envies the other's allocation, given their valuations. A common approach in fair division problems is to aim for an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation, where each agent believes they received the best possible bundle of items given the constraints.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation for all items is 77 + 34 + 74 + 5 + 81 + 26 + 15 + 83 + 79 = 474.
- Agent 1's total valuation for all items is 2 + 61 + 51 + 37 + 73 + 96 + 56 + 77 + 23 = 476.

Given the close total valuations, an approximately fair division should aim to give each agent an allocation with a total value as close as possible to half of their respective total valuations.

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by allocating high-value items for each agent based on their preferences.
2. Ensure that the total value of the allocation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

**Allocation:**

- **Agent 0** values items 4, 7, 8 highly.
- **Agent 1** values item 5 very highly.

Let's distribute the items:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (96 is the highest individual valuation across both agents).
- Assign items 4, 7, 8 to Agent 0 as these are among their most valued.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 since it's relatively high for them compared to Agent 0.
- Allocate the remaining items to balance the valuations:

    - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (77 is high for Agent 0).
    - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (61 is high for Agent 1).
    - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
    - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

Now let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0 gets:** 0, 2, 4, 7, 8 with values 77, 74, 81, 83, 79 = 394.
- **Agent 1 gets:** 1, 3, 5, 6 with values 61, 37, 96, 56 = 250.

This allocation gives each agent a substantial portion of their highest valued items while keeping the total value relatively balanced.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
