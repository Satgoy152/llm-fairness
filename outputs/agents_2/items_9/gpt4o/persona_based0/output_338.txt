Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  27  59  44  55  45  82  34  58
1  54  54  86  80  82  28  85  51  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54 54 86 80 82 28 85 51 59]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring an integer number of items per agent, a common approach is to use the concept of "envy-freeness," where each agent feels they have received the best possible allocation given their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 8 + 27 + 59 + 44 + 55 + 45 + 82 + 34 + 58 = 412
- Agent 1's total valuation: 54 + 54 + 86 + 80 + 82 + 28 + 85 + 51 + 59 = 579

Let's attempt to distribute the items based on maximizing individual utility and ensuring envy-freeness:

1. First, identify high-value items for each agent.
2. Distribute items such that each agent's total valuation of their items is as close as possible to an equitable split.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Maximize the sum of values by prioritizing items they value highly.
   - High-value items: 6 (82), 2 (59), 8 (58).

2. **Agent 1**: Maximize the sum of values by prioritizing items they value highly.
   - High-value items: 2 (86), 6 (85), 4 (82).

Given the constraints of integer allocations:

- **Agent 0** receives items: 6, 2, 8
- **Agent 1** receives items: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.
