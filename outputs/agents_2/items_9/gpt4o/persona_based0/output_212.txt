Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  52  92  73  14  20  42  43  35
1  52  90  10  72  19  21   0   6   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider their valuations and try to balance them. Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent believes they have received at least as much value as the other agent, according to their own valuations.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items and consider a fair distribution:

- Total value for agent 0: 55 + 52 + 92 + 73 + 14 + 20 + 42 + 43 + 35 = 426
- Total value for agent 1: 52 + 90 + 10 + 72 + 19 + 21 + 0 + 6 + 4 = 274

The sum of values across all items is different for each agent due to their subjective valuations, but we will attempt to distribute the items such that the perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 values item 2 (92) highly, so giving this item to Agent 0 could help balance the perceived value.
- Agent 1 values item 1 (90) highly, so giving this item to Agent 1 could also help balance the perceived value.
  
Let's try the following allocation:

- Give items 0, 2, 6, 7, and 8 to Agent 0.
- Give items 1, 3, 4, and 5 to Agent 1.

Now, let's calculate the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0's allocation: 
  - Values: 55 (item 0) + 92 (item 2) + 42 (item 6) + 43 (item 7) + 35 (item 8) = 267
- Agent 1's allocation:
  - Values: 90 (item 1) + 72 (item 3) + 19 (item 4) + 21 (item 5) = 202

This allocation attempts to balance the relative perceived value each agent receives based on their own valuations. Both agents receive items they value highly, and the overall allocation is split with the aim of minimizing envy.

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
