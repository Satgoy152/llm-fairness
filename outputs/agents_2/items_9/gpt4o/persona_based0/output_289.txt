Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  94   5  71  96  87  94  73  14
1  95  48  64   0  28  83  56  27  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can start by considering each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that both agents feel they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's begin by summing the total valuations of each agent for all items:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 0 + 94 + 5 + 71 + 96 + 87 + 94 + 73 + 14 = 534
- Agent 1 total valuation: 95 + 48 + 64 + 0 + 28 + 83 + 56 + 27 + 39 = 440

Now, let's try to allocate the items to balance the perceived value for each agent while ensuring each receives an integer number of items:

1. Assign items based on each agent's highest-to-lowest valuations, attempting to ensure both agents receive approximately the same total valuation.

2. Start with items that have the highest difference in valuation between the two agents, assigning them to the agent who values them more.

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 95, and Agent 0 values it at 0. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 94, and Agent 1 values it at 48. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 64, and Agent 0 values it at 5. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 71, and Agent 1 values it at 0. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 96, and Agent 1 values it at 28. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 87, and Agent 1 values it at 83. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 94, and Agent 1 values it at 56. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 73, and Agent 1 values it at 27. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it at 39, and Agent 0 values it at 14. Assign to Agent 1.

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's perceived value while keeping the distribution fair and balanced across all items. Letâ€™s summarize the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 8]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 and Agent 1 both receive items that maximize their individual valuations, aiming for a fair distribution based on their preferences.
