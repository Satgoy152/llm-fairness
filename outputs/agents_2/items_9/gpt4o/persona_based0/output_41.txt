Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  97  52  38  78  47  65  53  49
1  15  98  51  94  71  80  67  20  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items between the two agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we will adopt the method of maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 2 + 97 + 52 + 38 + 78 + 47 + 65 + 53 + 49 = 481
   - Agent 1: 15 + 98 + 51 + 94 + 71 + 80 + 67 + 20 + 59 = 555

2. **Identify High Valuation Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's top valued items (descending order): 1 (97), 4 (78), 6 (65), 7 (53), 2 (52), 8 (49), 5 (47), 3 (38), 0 (2)
   - Agent 1's top valued items (descending order): 1 (98), 3 (94), 5 (80), 6 (67), 4 (71), 8 (59), 2 (51), 0 (15), 7 (20)

3. **Allocate Items to Maximize Fairness:**
   - Both agents value item 1 highly, but Agent 1 values it slightly more. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 since it is the second highest valued item for Agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 since it is the second highest valued item for Agent 0 and the next highest available.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 since it is higher valued for Agent 1.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 since it is higher valued for Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 since it is higher valued for Agent 0.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0 since it is higher valued for Agent 0.
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 1 since it is higher valued for Agent 1.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 since it is higher valued for Agent 1.

4. **Verify Fairness:**
   - Ensure each agent receives a mix of high and low value items according to their preferences.
   - Check that there are no unallocated items and each agent's allocation reflects their preferences as closely as possible.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 6, 7
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 3, 5, 8

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 5, 8]
}
```
