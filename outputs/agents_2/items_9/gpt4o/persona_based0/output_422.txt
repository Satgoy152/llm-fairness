Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  21   7  67   4   8  92  25   8
1  76  39  89  99  26  98  38  81  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation based on their own valuation.

Given the valuations in the table, we can start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0: 0 + 21 + 7 + 67 + 4 + 8 + 92 + 25 + 8 = 232
- Agent 1: 76 + 39 + 89 + 99 + 26 + 98 + 38 + 81 + 79 = 625

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent's perceived value of their bundle is maximized while making sure that they do not envy each other's allocation.

Let's start allocating the items based on the highest valuations first, ensuring that each agent gets items that they value highly. 

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 3 (value 99 for Agent 1, 67 for Agent 0)
   - Item 5 (value 98 for Agent 1, 8 for Agent 0)
   - Item 2 (value 89 for Agent 1, 7 for Agent 0)
   - Item 1 (value 39 for Agent 1, 21 for Agent 0)

2. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 6 (value 92 for Agent 0, 38 for Agent 1)
   - Item 7 (value 25 for Agent 0, 81 for Agent 1)
   - Item 0 (value 0 for Agent 0, 76 for Agent 1)
   - Item 4 (value 4 for Agent 0, 26 for Agent 1)
   - Item 8 (value 8 for Agent 0, 79 for Agent 1)

### Final Allocations

The allocations are fairly divided, ensuring each agent receives items they highly value, and both agents have a substantial allocation based on their valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 0, 4, 8],
    "1": [3, 5, 2, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items that are more valuable to them compared to the other agent's valuation of those items.
