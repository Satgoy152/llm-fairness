Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  91  38  58  90  37  47  65  77
1  65  83  79  34  63  22   2  87  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[66 91 38 58 90 37 47 65 77]
 [65 83 79 34 63 22  2 87 86]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we must consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate these items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuation.

Given the valuation matrix:
```
Agent 0: 66, 91, 38, 58, 90, 37, 47, 65, 77
Agent 1: 65, 83, 79, 34, 63, 22,  2, 87, 86
```

One approach to ensure fairness is to use the "divide and choose" method or to iteratively assign items by maximizing envy-freeness. Here, let's allocate items to balance the total valuation for each agent as much as possible:

1. Sort the items by the absolute difference in valuations for both agents and start allocating them to the agent valuing them higher, while keeping track of the total value each agent receives.

2. Allocate the items:

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it 66 and Agent 1 values it 65. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it 91 and Agent 1 values it 83. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it 38 and Agent 1 values it 79. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it 58 and Agent 1 values it 34. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it 90 and Agent 1 values it 63. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it 37 and Agent 1 values it 22. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it 47 and Agent 1 values it 2. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it 65 and Agent 1 values it 87. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it 77 and Agent 1 values it 86. Assign to Agent 1.

The allocation can be summarized as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- Agent 1 receives items: [2, 7, 8]

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share based on their individual valuations.
