Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46   3  94  42  23  64   1  97  88
1  60  35  22  91  88  16  37   8  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to allocate items such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness ensures that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocation given to any other agent.

Let's start by considering the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(46 + 3 + 94 + 42 + 23 + 64 + 1 + 97 + 88 = 458\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(60 + 35 + 22 + 91 + 88 + 16 + 37 + 8 + 36 = 393\)

To achieve a fair allocation, we aim to distribute items such that each agent receives a roughly equal share of their total valuation.

### Allocation Process

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0 values item 7 highly (97).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 highly (88).

2. **Allocate based on highest remaining value**:
   - Assign high-value items to each agent sequentially to balance total valuation.

3. **Iterate over remaining items**:
   - Continue assigning items to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

### Proposed Allocation

- Allocate items to Agent 0:  
  Items: 0, 2, 5, 6  
  Total valuation for Agent 0: \(46 + 94 + 64 + 1 = 205\)

- Allocate items to Agent 1:  
  Items: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8  
  Total valuation for Agent 1: \(35 + 91 + 88 + 8 + 36 = 258\)

### JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations between agents, minimizing potential envy as much as possible given the constraints.
