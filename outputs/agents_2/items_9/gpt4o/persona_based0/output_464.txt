Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  85  26  59  62  28   9  60  58
1  30   1  39  50  34  94  49   0  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30  1 39 50 34 94 49  0 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free or as fair as possible distribution. We will calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and attempt to allocate items to balance these total values or come as close as possible.

### Total Valuation Calculation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Total valuation: 28 + 85 + 26 + 59 + 62 + 28 + 9 + 60 + 58 = 415

- **Agent 1:**
  - Total valuation: 30 + 1 + 39 + 50 + 34 + 94 + 49 + 0 + 53 = 350

Given these valuations, we aim to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is balanced or as close as possible, considering integer allocations.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Assign high-value items to the agent who values them significantly more than the other agent, or to equalize total values.**
2. **Ensure each agent receives items such that the number of items and total valuations are as balanced as possible.**

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: [1, 4, 7, 8]
  - Total valuation: 85 + 62 + 60 + 58 = 265

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: [0, 2, 3, 5, 6]
  - Total valuation: 30 + 39 + 50 + 94 + 49 = 262

This allocation provides a fairly balanced distribution in terms of valuations between the agents.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures fairness in terms of the total valuation each agent receives from their assigned items while ensuring all items are distributed.
