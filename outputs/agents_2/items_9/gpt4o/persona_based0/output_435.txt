Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  84  93  77  13  95  50  36  42
1  34  95  83  38  82  57  19  56  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation between the two agents given their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that they do not prefer any other agent's bundle over their own. This is a challenging problem in fair division, especially with only two agents and discrete items. However, we can attempt to minimize envy and ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 46 + 84 + 93 + 77 + 13 + 95 + 50 + 36 + 42 = 536
- Agent 1's total valuation: 34 + 95 + 83 + 38 + 82 + 57 + 19 + 56 + 62 = 526

Now, let's try to allocate the items in such a way that attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

1. Start by allocating high-value items to each agent based on their preferences.
2. Gradually assign remaining items while trying to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's allocate items:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 95) and item 1 to Agent 1 (value 95).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 93) and item 4 to Agent 1 (value 82).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 77) and item 8 to Agent 1 (value 62).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 46) and item 7 to Agent 1 (value 56).
5. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 50).

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0's items: 5, 2, 3, 0, 6
- Agent 1's items: 1, 4, 8, 7

Total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 95 + 93 + 77 + 46 + 50 = 361
- Agent 1's total valuation: 95 + 82 + 62 + 56 = 295

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations between the agents, though it may not be perfectly envy-free. Given the discrete nature and the goal of minimizing envy, this is a reasonable attempt.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2, 3, 0, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 8, 7]
}
```
