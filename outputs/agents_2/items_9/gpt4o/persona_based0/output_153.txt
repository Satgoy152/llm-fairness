Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  94  10  86  54  61  56   7  95
1  35  10  15  49  63  35  46  56  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 10 15 49 63 35 46 56 30]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents, we aim to allocate the items in a manner that is envy-free as much as possible. Envy-freeness is a condition where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:
- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items: 1 (94) and 8 (95).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for items: 4 (63) and 7 (56).

A fair strategy is to initially allocate the highest valued items to the agent with the highest valuation for those items, and then allocate the remaining items to balance the total value each agent receives.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it at 94.
2. Allocate item 8 to Agent 0, as they value it at 95.
3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as they value it at 63.
4. Allocate item 7 to Agent 1, as they value it at 56.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to balance the total value:

- Items remaining: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6.

5. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (valued at 86 by Agent 0, 49 by Agent 1).
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (valued at 61 by Agent 0, 35 by Agent 1).
7. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (valued at 22 by Agent 0, 35 by Agent 1).
8. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (valued at 10 by Agent 0, 15 by Agent 1).
9. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (valued at 56 by Agent 0, 46 by Agent 1).

**Final allocations:**

Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 5, 8  
Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
