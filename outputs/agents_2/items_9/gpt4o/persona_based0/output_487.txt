Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  95  26  42  67  87  37  88  49
1  22  40  66  36  52  40  49  52  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent. Our goal is to distribute the items in a way that each agent feels they have a fair share, ideally without envy.

First, let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [49, 95, 26, 42, 67, 87, 37, 88, 49]
- Agent 1's valuations: [22, 40, 66, 36, 52, 40, 49, 52, 52]

We want to aim for a distribution where the sum of the values of items allocated to each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's start by sorting the items to each agent by their individual preference:

1. **Agent 0's priorities (sorted by value):** 
   - Item 1 (95), Item 7 (88), Item 5 (87), Item 4 (67), Item 0 (49), Item 8 (49), Item 3 (42), Item 6 (37), Item 2 (26)

2. **Agent 1's priorities (sorted by value):** 
   - Item 2 (66), Item 4 (52), Item 7 (52), Item 8 (52), Item 0 (22), Item 5 (40), Item 1 (40), Item 3 (36), Item 6 (49)

Now let's try to allocate these items to balance the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Assign the highest valued items to each agent alternately, ensuring fairness in valuation distribution.

Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** [1, 5, 7, 3, 2] 
  - Values: 95, 87, 88, 42, 26 
  - Total value: 338

- **Agent 1:** [0, 4, 8, 6] 
  - Values: 22, 52, 52, 49 
  - Total value: 175

This allocation attempts to offer a balance where both agents get a decent share of high-valued items according to their preference, although Agent 0 ends up with a higher total valuation due to larger differences in individual item valuations.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7, 3, 2],
    "1": [0, 4, 8, 6]
}
```

This ensures all 9 items are allocated and each agent receives a fair portion based on their own valuation priorities.
