Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  51  76  58  17   7  57  11  99
1  35  25  82  46  82  17  26  18  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to find a division that minimizes envy and ideally achieves an envy-free allocation. An allocation is envy-free if each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as any other agent's bundle.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0's total value**: 72 + 51 + 76 + 58 + 17 + 7 + 57 + 11 + 99 = 448
- **Agent 1's total value**: 35 + 25 + 82 + 46 + 82 + 17 + 26 + 18 + 23 = 334

Now, let's aim for an allocation that equalizes the perceived value of the bundles as much as possible for both agents.

1. **Assign high-value items to respective agents**:  
   - Agent 0 values item 8 the highest (99).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (82).

2. **Next, assign remaining high-value items to balance total values**:  
   - For Agent 0: Assign items 0 and 2 (72 and 76).
   - For Agent 1: Assign items 4 and 3 (82 and 46).

3. **Fill in remaining items to balance the perceived value**:
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (57).
   - Assign items 1, 5, and 7 to Agent 1 (25, 17, 18).

After these assignments, let's check the total value each agent perceives:

- **Agent 0's bundle**: Items [0, 2, 6, 8]
  - Total value = 72 + 76 + 57 + 99 = 304

- **Agent 1's bundle**: Items [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]
  - Total value = 25 + 46 + 82 + 17 + 18 = 188

Although perfect envy-freeness might be challenging due to discrete allocations, this setup minimizes the difference given the constraint of integer item assignments. It attempts to give each agent a fair share relative to their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
