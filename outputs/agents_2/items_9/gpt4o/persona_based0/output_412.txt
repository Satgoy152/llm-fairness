Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62   6  76  41  19  84  52  98  30
1  88  58  56   3  73  84  21   3  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free outcome where each agent believes they received a fair share based on their valuations. In this situation, we will use the method of "maximum sum" or "utilitarian" allocation, which maximizes the total utility for each agent based on their valuations, ensuring that the distribution is as equitable as possible.

First, let's list the valuations for each agent:

**Agent 0:**
- Item 0: 62
- Item 1: 6
- Item 2: 76
- Item 3: 41
- Item 4: 19
- Item 5: 84
- Item 6: 52
- Item 7: 98
- Item 8: 30

**Agent 1:**
- Item 0: 88
- Item 1: 58
- Item 2: 56
- Item 3: 3
- Item 4: 73
- Item 5: 84
- Item 6: 21
- Item 7: 3
- Item 8: 77

To ensure fairness, we will consider each agent's highest valued items and allocate them accordingly, balancing the total value for both agents:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items:** 98 (Item 7), 84 (Item 5), 76 (Item 2)
2. **Agent 1's highest valued items:** 88 (Item 0), 84 (Item 5), 77 (Item 8)

Let's allocate items to balance the total valuation for each agent:

- **Assign Item 7 to Agent 0** (highest value for Agent 0)
- **Assign Item 5 to Agent 1** (equal high value for both agents, but Agent 1 has more high-value items to compensate)
- **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1** (highest value for Agent 1)
- **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0** (second highest for Agent 0)
- **Assign Item 8 to Agent 1** (second highest for Agent 1)
- **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1** (third highest for Agent 1)
- **Assign Item 6 to Agent 0** (next highest for Agent 0)
- **Assign Item 3 to Agent 0** (next highest for Agent 0)
- **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1** (next highest for Agent 1)

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives, considering their preferences over the items.

Now, presenting the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 items [2, 3, 6, 7] with total valuation of 267 and Agent 1 items [0, 1, 4, 5, 8] with total valuation of 380. Although Agent 1 has a higher total valuation, the allocation reflects the agents' preferences fairly, aiming for a balance of perceived value.
