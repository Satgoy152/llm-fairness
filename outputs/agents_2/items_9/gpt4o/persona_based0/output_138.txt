Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  43  35  75  93  93  29  21  51
1  77  53  20  24  29  64  54  51  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the method of ensuring that each agent values their allocation as much as possible given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s one way to approach this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: First, calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.

   - Agent 0's total valuation: \(7 + 43 + 35 + 75 + 93 + 93 + 29 + 21 + 51 = 447\)
   - Agent 1's total valuation: \(77 + 53 + 20 + 24 + 29 + 64 + 54 + 51 + 35 = 407\)

2. **Initial Allocation**: To aim for envy-freeness, we can start by assigning items in a manner that balances the total value as evenly as possible between the agents.

3. **Greedy Allocation**: Assign items one by one to the agent who values them the most while keeping track of total value assigned to each agent.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 77, while Agent 0 values it at 7. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 43, while Agent 1 values it at 53. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 35, while Agent 1 values it at 20. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 75, while Agent 1 values it at 24. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 93, while Agent 1 values it at 29. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 93, while Agent 1 values it at 64. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 29, while Agent 1 values it at 54. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 21, while Agent 1 values it at 51. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 51, while Agent 1 values it at 35. Assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's provide the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 items [2, 3, 4, 5, 8] with a total valuation of 347, and Agent 1 items [0, 1, 6, 7] with a total valuation of 313. This aims to balance the total value received by each agent as evenly as possible, reducing envy.
