Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  25  31  17  57  31  98  10  59
1  35  54  40  16  15  46  54  62  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation between the two agents that takes into account envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that neither agent would prefer the other's allocated items to their own, if possible.

Let's first list the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 95 + 25 + 31 + 17 + 57 + 31 + 98 + 10 + 59 = 423
- Agent 1's total valuation: 35 + 54 + 40 + 16 + 15 + 46 + 54 + 62 + 36 = 358

To allocate the items fairly, we can use a method like the "round-robin" procedure based on the agents' preferences, which is a simple yet effective way to approximate fairness. We will sequentially assign the highest-valued remaining item to each agent in turns.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0's first pick:** Item 6 (value 98)
2. **Agent 1's first pick:** Item 7 (value 62)
3. **Agent 0's second pick:** Item 0 (value 95)
4. **Agent 1's second pick:** Item 1 (value 54)
5. **Agent 0's third pick:** Item 8 (value 59)
6. **Agent 1's third pick:** Item 2 (value 40)
7. **Agent 0's fourth pick:** Item 4 (value 57)
8. **Agent 1's fourth pick:** Item 5 (value 46)
9. **Agent 0's fifth pick:** Item 3 (value 17)

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 6, 0, 8, 4, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 7, 1, 2, 5

With these allocations, every item is distributed, and we approximate fairness by allowing each agent to pick items based on their highest valuations.

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0, 8, 4, 3],
    "1": [7, 1, 2, 5]
}
```
