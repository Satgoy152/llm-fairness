Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  21  95  83  56  60  41  29  57
1  90  40  37  85  33  60  37  75  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90 40 37 85 33 60 37 75 45]]
Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly and minimize envy, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if each agent values their own bundle of items at least as much as the bundle of any other agent, given their individual valuations.

Let's analyze the valuation table and consider the total value each agent can gain from different allocations. Our goal is to ensure that both agents feel they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Agent valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Total valuation: 22 + 21 + 95 + 83 + 56 + 60 + 41 + 29 + 57 = 464

- Agent 1:
  - Total valuation: 90 + 40 + 37 + 85 + 33 + 60 + 37 + 75 + 45 = 502

We aim to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as equitable.

A possible strategy is to assign items with the highest individual valuations to each agent, ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation. Let's consider the following allocation:

1. Start by allocating the items where each agent has a significantly higher valuation compared to the other.
2. Balance the distribution by considering the total valuation each agent has for their allocated items.

Here's a fair allocation based on these steps:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 3, 5, 8
  - Total value for Agent 0: 95 + 83 + 60 + 57 = 295

- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7
  - Total value for Agent 1: 90 + 40 + 33 + 37 + 75 = 275

This allocation ensures that both agents get a bundle they value highly, and the distribution is balanced based on their respective valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
