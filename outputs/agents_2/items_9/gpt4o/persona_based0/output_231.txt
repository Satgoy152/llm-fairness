Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  96  43  71  15  21  89  82  76
1  63  33  99  97  49  36  26  43  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 96 43 71 15 21 89 82 76]
 [63 33 99 97 49 36 26 43 18]]
Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair division of items between the two agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as the allocation of the other agent. A common approach to this problem is to use a method like the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or similar fair division algorithms. However, given the simplicity of the problem (only two agents and nine items), we can use a straightforward allocation strategy.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 89 + 96 + 43 + 71 + 15 + 21 + 89 + 82 + 76 = 582
- Agent 1: 63 + 33 + 99 + 97 + 49 + 36 + 26 + 43 + 18 = 464

Now, we'll allocate items to balance these valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign items to each agent one by one, starting with the item that each agent values the most, ensuring fairness.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure that no agent envies the allocation of the other.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valued items: 1 (96), 0 (89), 6 (89).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valued items: 2 (99), 3 (97).

At this point:
- Agent 0 has items: 1, 0, 6
- Agent 1 has items: 2, 3

Now, let's assign the remaining items to balance the perceived value:

- For item 4, Agent 0 values it 15, and Agent 1 values it 49. Assign to Agent 1.
- For item 5, Agent 0 values it 21, and Agent 1 values it 36. Assign to Agent 1.
- For item 7, Agent 0 values it 82, and Agent 1 values it 43. Assign to Agent 0.
- For item 8, Agent 0 values it 76, and Agent 1 values it 18. Assign to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 6, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 4, 5]

This allocation ensures that the agents are fairly treated based on their valuations and that all items are allocated.

### JSON Representation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
