Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  91   4  18  44   8  95  28  92
1  49  48  53   7  75  66  73  44  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-free allocation, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their valuation.

### Step-by-Step Allocation Process:

1. **List the Items by Valuation for Each Agent:**

   - **Agent 0:**
     - Item 6: 95
     - Item 8: 92
     - Item 1: 91
     - Item 4: 44
     - Item 7: 28
     - Item 3: 18
     - Item 5: 8
     - Item 0: 5
     - Item 2: 4

   - **Agent 1:**
     - Item 4: 75
     - Item 8: 80
     - Item 6: 73
     - Item 5: 66
     - Item 2: 53
     - Item 0: 49
     - Item 1: 48
     - Item 7: 44
     - Item 3: 7

2. **Allocate High-Value Items First:**

   We aim to allocate the highest value items for each agent to ensure fairness and minimize envy.

3. **Initial Allocation:**

   - **Agent 0** highly values items 6, 8, and 1.
   - **Agent 1** highly values items 4, 8, and 6.

4. **Resolve Conflicts by Assigning Unique High-Value Items:**

   Since both agents value item 8 highly, we attempt to balance by ensuring each gets a fair share of their high-value items.

5. **Final Allocation:**

   - **Agent 0**:
     - Item 6: 95
     - Item 1: 91
     - Item 2: 4
     - Item 3: 18
     - Item 7: 28

   - **Agent 1**:
     - Item 4: 75
     - Item 8: 80
     - Item 5: 66
     - Item 0: 49

6. **Check Total Items:**

   Ensure all 9 items are allocated:
   - Agent 0: 5 items
   - Agent 1: 4 items

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1, 2, 3, 7],
    "1": [4, 8, 5, 0]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items fairly based on each agent's valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, with no overlaps or omissions in the allocation.
