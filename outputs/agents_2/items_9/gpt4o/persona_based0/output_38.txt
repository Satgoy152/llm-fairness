Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  92  39   8  32  84  85  19  95
1  95  53  50  28  60  96  84  61  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and ensure that each agent feels they received an equitable share of the total value.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(98 + 92 + 39 + 8 + 32 + 84 + 85 + 19 + 95 = 552\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(95 + 53 + 50 + 28 + 60 + 96 + 84 + 61 + 62 = 589\)

To achieve a fair allocation, we should aim for each agent to receive about half of their total valuation:

- Ideal value for Agent 0: \(552 / 2 = 276\)
- Ideal value for Agent 1: \(589 / 2 = 294.5\)

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items so that each agent's received value is as close as possible to these ideal values:

1. **Allocate high-value items to Agent 0**:
   - Item 0 (98), Item 1 (92), Item 8 (95): Total = 285 (close to 276)

2. **Allocate remaining items to Agent 1** to maximize their value:
   - Item 5 (96), Item 6 (84), Item 4 (60), Item 7 (61), Item 2 (50), Item 3 (28): Total = 304 (close to 294.5)

These allocations ensure that each agent receives items that approximate their ideal values as closely as possible, given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 8],
    "1": [5, 6, 4, 7, 2, 3]
}
```
