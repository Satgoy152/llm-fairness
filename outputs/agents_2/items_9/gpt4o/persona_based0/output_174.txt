Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  20  28  78   0  29  28  93  95
1  28  44  84  49  10  97  69  45  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1) while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that both agents feel that they have received a fair share according to their own valuations. One common approach to achieve this is to aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of the other agent over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations given:

Agent 0's valuations:

- Item 0: 47
- Item 1: 20
- Item 2: 28
- Item 3: 78
- Item 4: 0
- Item 5: 29
- Item 6: 28
- Item 7: 93
- Item 8: 95

Agent 1's valuations:

- Item 0: 28
- Item 1: 44
- Item 2: 84
- Item 3: 49
- Item 4: 10
- Item 5: 97
- Item 6: 69
- Item 7: 45
- Item 8: 37

### Proposed Allocation

To ensure a fair division, we aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives while also considering that each agent should get a number of items close to half of the total (which is 9 items, so typically 4 or 5 items per agent).

A possible allocation strategy is as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that they value highly and that provide them with a total value comparable to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that they value highly, ensuring their total value is similar to Agent 0.

Considering these points, here's a balanced allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0, Item 3, Item 7, Item 8
- **Agent 1**: Item 1, Item 2, Item 4, Item 5, Item 6

### Verification

- **Agent 0's Total Valuation**: 47 (item 0) + 78 (item 3) + 93 (item 7) + 95 (item 8) = 313
- **Agent 1's Total Valuation**: 44 (item 1) + 84 (item 2) + 10 (item 4) + 97 (item 5) + 69 (item 6) = 304

Both agents receive a high value according to their preferences, and the allocation is roughly balanced in terms of their respective valuations.

### JSON Format Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed between the two agents, and each agent receives a set of items they value highly, leading to a fair and envy-free allocation.
