Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  90  12  10  64  28  51   9  11
1  27  78  88  28  32  61  82  98  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a combination of the maximin strategy and ensuring that each agent's allocation is not envied by the other.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 96 + 90 + 12 + 10 + 64 + 28 + 51 + 9 + 11 = 371
- Agent 1: 27 + 78 + 88 + 28 + 32 + 61 + 82 + 98 + 46 = 540

Agent 0 values the items at a total of 371 units, while Agent 1 values them at 540 units.

Now, let's try to allocate the items to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly and attempt to balance the perceived value of the allocations between the two agents.

### Allocation Strategy
1. Start by allocating the items that each agent values the most.
2. Ensure that the total value of items received by each agent is as equitable as possible based on their individual valuation.

#### Step-by-Step Allocation

- **Agent 0 Preferences:**
  - Highest valuations: Item 0 (96), Item 1 (90), Item 4 (64)
  
- **Agent 1 Preferences:**
  - Highest valuations: Item 7 (98), Item 2 (88), Item 6 (82)

Given the preferences, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Allocate items 0, 1, and 4. These are among the highest valued for Agent 0.
   - Remaining value for Agent 0: 96 + 90 + 64 = 250

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Allocate items 2, 6, and 7. These are among the highest valued for Agent 1.
   - Remaining value for Agent 1: 88 + 82 + 98 = 268

Now, there are still three items left: 3, 5, and 8. Let's distribute them to balance the total value:

- **Agent 0:** Items 5 (28), 9 (11)
  - New Total for Agent 0: 250 + 28 + 11 = 289

- **Agent 1:** Item 3 (28)
  - New Total for Agent 1: 268 + 28 = 296

Thus, each agent is left with a close total valuation based on their perception. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
