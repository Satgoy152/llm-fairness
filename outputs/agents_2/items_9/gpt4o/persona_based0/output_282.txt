Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  52  16  44  88  36  58  27  66
1   7  76  55  76  39  68  45   7  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness while considering the preferences of each agent based on their valuations. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by the other agent over their own bundle.

Let's summarize the problem:

- We have 2 agents and 9 items.
- Each agent's preference for each item is given in the table.
- We aim to distribute all 9 items between the two agents.

Let's calculate the total value that each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation for all items is: \(30 + 52 + 16 + 44 + 88 + 36 + 58 + 27 + 66 = 417\).
- Agent 1's total valuation for all items is: \(7 + 76 + 55 + 76 + 39 + 68 + 45 + 7 + 62 = 435\).

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we will distribute the items so that each agent values their own bundle as much as possible, taking into account the total valuation and individual preferences.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **High-value prioritization**: Start by allocating items that are highly valued by one agent and less by the other.

2. **Balancing total value**: Try to balance the total value received by each agent according to their preferences.

### Allocation

- **Agent 0**: They highly value item 4 (88), item 8 (66), and item 6 (58).
- **Agent 1**: They highly value item 1 (76), item 3 (76), and item 5 (68).

Let's allocate the items:

- Allocate item 4, item 8, and item 6 to Agent 0 because they highly value these items: \(88 + 66 + 58 = 212\).
- Allocate item 1, item 3, and item 5 to Agent 1 because they highly value these items: \(76 + 76 + 68 = 220\).
- Now, allocate the remaining items to balance the total value:
  - Give item 0 and item 2 to Agent 0, adding: \(30 + 16 = 46\).
  - Give item 7 to Agent 1, adding: \(7\).

Now, let's check the final allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [4, 6, 8, 0, 2] with total value \(88 + 58 + 66 + 30 + 16 = 258\).
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 3, 5, 7] with total value \(76 + 76 + 68 + 7 = 227\).

Both agents receive a fair and envy-free bundle based on their valuations.

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 8, 0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
