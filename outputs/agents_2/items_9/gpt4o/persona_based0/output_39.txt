Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  40   1  13  16  69  52  95  73
1  72   1  11  10  42  77  50   1  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. While achieving envy-freeness exactly can be difficult, we can attempt to get as close as possible by maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their allocation.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: First, we calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 17 + 40 + 1 + 13 + 16 + 69 + 52 + 95 + 73 = 376
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 72 + 1 + 11 + 10 + 42 + 77 + 50 + 1 + 98 = 362

2. **Item Ranking for Each Agent**: Rank the items based on each agent's valuation.
   - Agent 0's ranking (descending): 7, 8, 5, 6, 1, 0, 4, 3, 2
   - Agent 1's ranking (descending): 8, 5, 0, 6, 4, 2, 3, 7, 1

3. **Greedy Allocation**: Using a greedy approach, we can try to give each agent their most valued items while balancing the allocation.
   - Start by giving each agent their highest-valued item, alternating between the agents to balance the allocation count.

4. **Allocation Process**:
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (value 95), and item 8 to Agent 1 (value 98).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value 69), and item 0 to Agent 1 (value 72).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value 52), and item 4 to Agent 1 (value 42).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 40), and item 3 to Agent 1 (value 10).
   - Finally, allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 11).

5. **Final Allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Items [7, 5, 6, 1]
   - Agent 1: Items [8, 0, 4, 3, 2]

These allocations attempt to provide each agent with a high total value, while balancing the number of items each receives.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5, 6, 1],
    "1": [8, 0, 4, 3, 2]
}
```
