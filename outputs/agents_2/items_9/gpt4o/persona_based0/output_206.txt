Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  77  20  45  31  11  31  76   8
1  78  32  33  92  45  91  98  67  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[22 77 20 45 31 11 31 76  8]
 [78 32 33 92 45 91 98 67 56]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and attempts to be as equitable as possible.

Let's examine the valuations table:

- Agent 0 values items as follows:  
  \[
  \begin{array}{ccccccccc}
  22 & 77 & 20 & 45 & 31 & 11 & 31 & 76 & 8 \\
  \end{array}
  \]

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  \[
  \begin{array}{ccccccccc}
  78 & 32 & 33 & 92 & 45 & 91 & 98 & 67 & 56 \\
  \end{array}
  \]

To start, we can adopt an approach to maximize each agent's total valuation by assigning items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives. 

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 (77) and 7 (76).
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 6 (98), 3 (92), and 5 (91).

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 1 and 7 to Agent 0, where they have high valuations.
   - Allocate item 6, 3, and 5 to Agent 1, where they have high valuations.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - The remaining items to be allocated are: 0, 2, 4, and 8.
   - For these, we consider the remaining items' valuations per agent to balance the total value:
     - Agent 0: Item 0 (22), Item 2 (20), Item 4 (31), Item 8 (8)
     - Agent 1: Item 0 (78), Item 2 (33), Item 4 (45), Item 8 (56)

4. **Final Assignment:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (78 > 22).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (33 > 20).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (45 > 31).
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 0 (because Agent 1 already has a significant total valuation and to balance the number of items).

### Valuation After Allocation:
- **Agent 0** receives items 1, 7, and 8 for a total valuation of 161 (77 + 76 + 8).
- **Agent 1** receives items 6, 3, 5, 0, 2, and 4 for a total valuation of 437 (98 + 92 + 91 + 78 + 33 + 45).

This allocation aims to minimize envy and distribute items in a way that both agents receive a substantial portion of their most valued items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7, 8],
    "1": [6, 3, 5, 0, 2, 4]
}
```
