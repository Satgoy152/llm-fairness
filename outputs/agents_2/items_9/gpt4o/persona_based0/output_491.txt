Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  1  50  74  76  30  74  72  10  23
1  4  15  21  99  93  64  98   6  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation is one where each agent prefers their allocation over the allocation of any other agent based on their valuations.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [1, 50, 74, 76, 30, 74, 72, 10, 23]
- Agent 1's valuations: [4, 15, 21, 99, 93, 64, 98, 6, 52]

We can calculate the total value each agent perceives for all items:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 410
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 452

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent perceives roughly half of the total value in their allocation. Let's target around 205 for Agent 0 and 226 for Agent 1, keeping in mind this is a heuristic approach to guide us.

To allocate the items:

1. Begin with the items Agent 1 values very highly and try to allocate them to Agent 1. These are items 3 and 6.
2. Allocate items 2 and 5 to Agent 0 because they have high values for Agent 0 and relatively lower for Agent 1.
3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 because it has a high value for Agent 1.
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 because it has a substantial value for Agent 0.
5. Allocate item 8 to Agent 1 as it has a decent value.
6. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 and item 7 to Agent 0 to complete the allocation.

Now, let's list the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 1, 2, 5, 7]
- Agent 1 gets items: [3, 4, 6, 8]

Finally, present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their valuations, approaching an envy-free distribution.
