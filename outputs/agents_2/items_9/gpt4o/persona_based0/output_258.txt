Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  27  76  87  12  38  39  12  61
1  40  15  77   2  49  72  87  66  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use the "maximin" approach. This method aims to maximize the minimum value that each agent receives. Here's how the allocation process can be structured:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 92 + 27 + 76 + 87 + 12 + 38 + 39 + 12 + 61 = 444
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 40 + 15 + 77 + 2 + 49 + 72 + 87 + 66 + 22 = 430

2. **Assign Items:**
   - We will aim to allocate items in such a way that the perceived value (sum of item values) for each agent is as balanced as possible.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Sort items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents, and allocate the items that each agent values more highly.
   - Ensure that each agent receives a balanced total valuation.

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Agent 0 highly values items: 0, 3, 2
- Agent 1 highly values items: 6, 5, 7
- Remaining items to be balanced: 1, 4, 8

**Allocations:**

- Agent 0:
  - Items: 0, 2, 3
  - Total value: 92 + 76 + 87 = 255

- Agent 1:
  - Items: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
  - Total value: 15 + 49 + 72 + 87 + 66 + 22 = 311

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of the total valuation while considering their individual valuations.

**Final Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
