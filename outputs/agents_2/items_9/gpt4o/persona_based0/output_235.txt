Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  41  13  74  12  94   3  93  65
1  42   6   3  10  91  64  86  52  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while considering their valuations for each item, we aim for an envy-free allocation or as close to it as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should not prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. Let's assess the valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

### Valuations Table

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 91 | 41 | 13 | 74 | 12 | 94 | 3  | 93 | 65 |
| 1          | 42 | 6  | 3  | 10 | 91 | 64 | 86 | 52 | 42 |

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items with high valuations. Prioritize high-value items for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Similarly, prioritize items where Agent 1 has higher valuations compared to Agent 0.

### Calculating Allocations

- **Agent 0** has the highest valuations for items: 0, 5, 7, and 3.
- **Agent 1** has the highest valuations for items: 4, 6, and 1.

To ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, we can allocate the remaining items based on the relative valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 5, 7, 3, and 8.
- **Agent 1**: Items 4, 6, 1, and 2.

### Final Allocation

Based on the above strategy, the allocation can be represented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7, 3, 8],
    "1": [4, 6, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy, as each agent receives items that are relatively more valuable to them based on their preferences.
