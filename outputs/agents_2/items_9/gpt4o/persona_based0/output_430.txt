Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  67  60  49  92  47  92  58  97
1  81  91  55  59  41  35  94  44   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 67 60 49 92 47 92 58 97]
 [81 91 55 59 41 35 94 44  8]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness which ensures that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own based on their valuations. 

Given the table of valuations:

```
         0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
Agent 0: 81  67  60  49  92  47  92  58  97
Agent 1: 81  91  55  59  41  35  94  44   8
```

Let's calculate a potential allocation by considering the highest valuations for each item by each agent. One potential approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it more:

1. **Item 0**: Both agents value it equally, 81. We can give it to either agent. Let's assign it to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (91 vs. 67). Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (60 vs. 55). Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (59 vs. 49). Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (92 vs. 41). Assign to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (47 vs. 35). Assign to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (94 vs. 92). Assign to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (58 vs. 44). Assign to Agent 0.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (97 vs. 8). Assign to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 6]

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint of assigning exactly 9 items in total, and aims to achieve envy-freeness based on the given valuations.
