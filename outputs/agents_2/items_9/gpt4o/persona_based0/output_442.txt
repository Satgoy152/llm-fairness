Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  71  88  84  74  97  34   7  22
1   9  76  36  33  29  73  76  35  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent. We'll aim to allocate the items such that both agents are satisfied with their bundles and there is no incentive for them to want the other agent's allocated items.

To proceed, let's first calculate the total valuation each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 79 + 71 + 88 + 84 + 74 + 97 + 34 + 7 + 22 = 556
- Agent 1: 9 + 76 + 36 + 33 + 29 + 73 + 76 + 35 + 50 = 417

Next, let's attempt to distribute the items in a way that satisfies both agents:

1. Start by allocating the most valued items to each agent:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations on items 5, 2, 3, and 0.
   - Agent 1 has high valuations on items 1, 6, and 5.

2. Try to balance the total perceived value for each agent.

Let's create the allocation:

- Allocate items 0, 2, 3, 5 to Agent 0, as these are among their highest-valued items.
- Allocate items 1, 4, 6, 7, 8 to Agent 1, as this will provide them with a reasonable total value compared to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the total value for each agent based on these allocations:

- Agent 0 values items 0, 2, 3, 5: 79 + 88 + 84 + 97 = 348
- Agent 1 values items 1, 4, 6, 7, 8: 76 + 29 + 76 + 35 + 50 = 266

This allocation seems to provide an envy-free distribution as each agent has a bundle of items they value, and the distribution is balanced considering the initial total valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
