Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  67  42  69  23   7  28  34  57
1  81  78  25  40  81  40  87  13   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. We will consider each agent's valuations of the items and attempt to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [86, 67, 42, 69, 23, 7, 28, 34, 57]
- Agent 1's valuations: [81, 78, 25, 40, 81, 40, 87, 13, 5]

To find a fair division:

1. Calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent:
   - Agent 0 total valuation: 86 + 67 + 42 + 69 + 23 + 7 + 28 + 34 + 57 = 413
   - Agent 1 total valuation: 81 + 78 + 25 + 40 + 81 + 40 + 87 + 13 + 5 = 450

2. We aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible according to their valuations.

Based on these valuations, let's attempt an allocation that balances the perceived value for each agent:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
  - Agent 0's valuation of these items = 86 (item 0) + 67 (item 1) + 69 (item 3) + 23 (item 4) + 34 (item 7) = 279
  - Agent 1's valuation of these items = 81 (item 0) + 78 (item 1) + 40 (item 3) + 81 (item 4) + 13 (item 7) = 293

- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 5, 6, 8
  - Agent 0's valuation of these items = 42 (item 2) + 7 (item 5) + 28 (item 6) + 57 (item 8) = 134
  - Agent 1's valuation of these items = 25 (item 2) + 40 (item 5) + 87 (item 6) + 5 (item 8) = 157

The allocation results in:

- Total perceived value for Agent 0: 279
- Total perceived value for Agent 1: 157

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value for both agents, considering their individual valuations, while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed between the two agents.
