Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  47  48  69  79  50  99  91  79
1  13  95  49  37  98   8  29  30  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
In order to achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items such that no agent envies the other based on their respective valuations. This can be challenging, especially when the agents have significantly different valuations for the items.

To address this, we'll use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives while ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [90, 47, 48, 69, 79, 50, 99, 91, 79]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [13, 95, 49, 37, 98, 8, 29, 30, 42]

Now, let's attempt to distribute the items to balance the perceived value by each agent:

1. Allocate high-value items to Agent 0 (from their perspective): Items 0, 6, 7
2. Allocate high-value items to Agent 1 (from their perspective): Items 1, 4
3. Distribute remaining items to balance overall perceived value:
   - Agent 0: Items 2, 5
   - Agent 1: Items 3, 8

Now, check if the distribution is envy-free:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 6, 7, 2, 5 with total value = 90 + 99 + 91 + 48 + 50 = 378
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 4, 3, 8 with total value = 95 + 98 + 37 + 42 = 272

While this allocation may not be perfectly envy-free due to the inherent differences in item valuations, it aims to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences. Since envy-freeness is difficult to achieve with only two agents and integer allocations, this balanced approach provides a reasonable compromise.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 3, 8]
}
```
