Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  23  25  90  87  64  39  88  54
1  45  50  35  45  54  87  39   5   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents in a way that is fair and attempts to be envy-free, we must first consider each agent's valuation of the items. The key idea is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that they do not prefer the other agent's bundle over their own.

Here's a step-by-step process for achieving a fair and envy-free allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**:
   - Agent 0's total valuation for all items: 534
   - Agent 1's total valuation for all items: 369 

2. **Determine an Equal Share**:
   - The total valuation of the items is 903, and each agent should ideally receive a valuation of around 451.5 for a fair share.

3. **Greedy Allocation**:
   - Start by giving each agent the highest valued item that hasn't been allocated yet, ensuring that we check the remaining valuation to try and balance them around the fair share.

4. **Adjust to Balance the Allocations**:
   - After initial assignment of high-value items, adjust allocations to ensure each agent's total valuation is as close to their fair share as possible.

Here's a possible allocation based on the above strategy:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Items: 0, 3, 4, 7
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 64 + 90 + 87 + 88 = 329
  - Total valuation for Agent 1 for these items: 45 + 45 + 54 + 5 = 149

- **Agent 1**:
  - Items: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 23 + 25 + 64 + 39 + 54 = 205
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 50 + 35 + 87 + 39 + 9 = 220

In this allocation, each agent receives a bundle of items such that the combined valuation of their assigned items is as balanced as possible, given their initial valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
