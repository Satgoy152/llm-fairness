Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  55  27  37  14  15  58  48  88
1  33  90  79  81  90  89  36  83  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to balance the total value each agent receives. This is a classic fair division problem. Let's proceed by examining the valuations provided:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 82
- Item 1: 55
- Item 2: 27
- Item 3: 37
- Item 4: 14
- Item 5: 15
- Item 6: 58
- Item 7: 48
- Item 8: 88

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 33
- Item 1: 90
- Item 2: 79
- Item 3: 81
- Item 4: 90
- Item 5: 89
- Item 6: 36
- Item 7: 83
- Item 8: 79

To ensure a fair division, we aim to equally distribute the total value of items between the two agents. The primary goal is to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent values their own allocation at least as highly as the other agent's allocation.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items combined:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 424
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 660

2. Given the significant difference in total valuation, we might prioritize high-value items for Agent 0 to balance the perceived value.

3. Allocate items to each agent to balance the total valuations:

- Assign items with high value for Agent 0 and avoid high-value items for Agent 1 if possible.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0 (Value 82)
  - Item 1 (Value 55)
  - Item 6 (Value 58)
  - Item 8 (Value 88)
  
  Total value for Agent 0: 283

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 2 (Value 79)
  - Item 3 (Value 81)
  - Item 4 (Value 90)
  - Item 5 (Value 89)
  - Item 7 (Value 83)
  
  Total value for Agent 1: 377

This allocation gives a relatively balanced value for both agents, considering their preferences. It's important to note that perfect envy-freeness may not be achievable due to the significant difference in valuations, but this allocation attempts to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
