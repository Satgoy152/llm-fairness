Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  79   6  50  78  70  33  34  58
1  58   7  37  65  91  90  66  75  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free, meaning that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent. This can be approached by considering the valuations and attempting to equalize the total value that each agent receives, while also ensuring that the number of items allocated to each agent is an integer.

Let's begin by calculating the total value each agent places on all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 13 + 79 + 6 + 50 + 78 + 70 + 33 + 34 + 58 = 421
- Agent 1's total valuation: 58 + 7 + 37 + 65 + 91 + 90 + 66 + 75 + 99 = 588

The goal is to allocate items such that the total valuation by each agent is as close as possible. 

An effective approach is to start by assigning items that have significantly higher valuation by one agent compared to the other. Let's look at some items and their valuations:

- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 values it at 7.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 values it at 91.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 values it at 90.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 99.

We can start by giving each agent the items they value significantly more than the other agent:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 since they value it much higher than Agent 1.
2. Assign item 4, item 5, and item 8 to Agent 1 as they value these items significantly higher.

Now, let's calculate the remaining value for each agent with these initial allocations:

- Agent 0's current allocation: Item 1 (value 79)
- Agent 1's current allocation: Items 4, 5, 8 (values 91, 90, 99)

Remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 13 vs. 58).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 6 vs. 37).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 50 vs. 65).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 33 vs. 66).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 34 vs. 75).

Now Agent 0 has items: 0, 1, 3, 6
And Agent 1 has items: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8

Let's verify the final allocations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 13 (item 0) + 79 (item 1) + 50 (item 3) + 33 (item 6) = 175
- Agent 1's total valuation: 37 (item 2) + 91 (item 4) + 90 (item 5) + 75 (item 7) + 99 (item 8) = 392

Both valuations are not perfectly equal, but this allocation is designed to minimize envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
