Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  76  43  43  96  75  15  46  95
1  36   8  98  42  51  72  40  74  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider both agents' valuations for each item. Our goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their perspective:

- **Agent 0's total valuation**:  
  \(53 + 76 + 43 + 43 + 96 + 75 + 15 + 46 + 95 = 542\)

- **Agent 1's total valuation**:  
  \(36 + 8 + 98 + 42 + 51 + 72 + 40 + 74 + 58 = 479\)

Given these total valuations, we should aim for each agent to receive a fair share of the total value they perceive, which is half of their total valuation.

Next, let's consider each item and try to allocate them based on maximizing fairness and minimizing envy:

1. **Item 0**:  
   Agent 0 values it at 53, and Agent 1 values it at 36.  
   Assign to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:  
   Agent 0 values it at 76, and Agent 1 values it at 8.  
   Assign to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:  
   Agent 0 values it at 43, and Agent 1 values it at 98.  
   Assign to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:  
   Agent 0 values it at 43, and Agent 1 values it at 42.  
   The values are close, but let's assign to Agent 1 to balance the allocation.

5. **Item 4**:  
   Agent 0 values it at 96, and Agent 1 values it at 51.  
   Assign to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5**:  
   Agent 0 values it at 75, and Agent 1 values it at 72.  
   The values are close, but let's assign to Agent 1 to balance the allocation.

7. **Item 6**:  
   Agent 0 values it at 15, and Agent 1 values it at 40.  
   Assign to Agent 1.

8. **Item 7**:  
   Agent 0 values it at 46, and Agent 1 values it at 74.  
   Assign to Agent 1.

9. **Item 8**:  
   Agent 0 values it at 95, and Agent 1 values it at 58.  
   Assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1, 4, 8]  
  Total valuation for Agent 0: \(53 + 76 + 96 + 95 = 320\)

- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 3, 5, 6, 7]  
  Total valuation for Agent 1: \(98 + 42 + 72 + 40 + 74 = 326\)

Both agents receive allocations that are close to half of their total valuation, which should minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
