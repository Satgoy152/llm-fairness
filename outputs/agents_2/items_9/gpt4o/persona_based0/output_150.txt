Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  90  71  50   9  18  47  38  50
1  94  55  42  33  48  91  75  93  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve a balance in terms of the total value each agent receives, while ensuring no agent envies the allocation of another agent. This involves finding an allocation where each agent values their own bundle of items at least as much as they value the other agent's bundle.

Let's evaluate the total valuations for each agent and determine a fair allocation:

Agent 0's total valuation of all items:
- 13 + 90 + 71 + 50 + 9 + 18 + 47 + 38 + 50 = 386

Agent 1's total valuation of all items:
- 94 + 55 + 42 + 33 + 48 + 91 + 75 + 93 + 78 = 609

Now, we will attempt to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as equitable as possible. Here's a possible allocation:

- Allocate items [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to Agent 0
- Allocate items [0, 6, 7, 8] to Agent 1

Let's verify the valuations for this allocation:

**Agent 0:**
- Item 1: 90
- Item 2: 71
- Item 3: 50
- Item 4: 9
- Item 5: 18
- Total valuation = 90 + 71 + 50 + 9 + 18 = 238

**Agent 1:**
- Item 0: 94
- Item 6: 75
- Item 7: 93
- Item 8: 78
- Total valuation = 94 + 75 + 93 + 78 = 340

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 238 from their perspective, and Agent 1 a total valuation of 340 from their perspective. While not perfectly balanced, this is a reasonable distribution given the constraints.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
