Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  40  40  50  69  93  42  65  89
1  73  13  54  42  51  55  75  19  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [73 13 54 42 51 55 75 19 75]]
Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as they value the other agent's bundle. Given that there are 9 items, each agent should ideally receive approximately half the total value of all items based on their own valuations.

First, let's calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- **Agent 0's total value**:  
  \(36 + 40 + 40 + 50 + 69 + 93 + 42 + 65 + 89 = 524\)

- **Agent 1's total value**:  
  \(73 + 13 + 54 + 42 + 51 + 55 + 75 + 19 + 75 = 457\)

Next, let's try to allocate the items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is maximized while ensuring fairness.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** tends to value items 4, 5, and 8 highly.
2. **Agent 1** values items 0, 6, and 8 highly.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: We'll start by giving Agent 0 the items they value the most, while ensuring Agent 1 is not envious of the allocation.
  - Items: 4, 5, 8

- **Agent 1**: We'll allocate items that maximize Agent 1's valuation while considering the remaining high-value items for Agent 0.
  - Items: 0, 2, 6

With these allocations, let's evaluate the remaining items and distribute them to balance the overall perceived fairness:

- **Agent 0** additional items: 3, 7
- **Agent 1** additional item: 1

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [4, 5, 8, 3, 7]
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 2, 6, 1]

This allocation aims to balance the total perceived value for each agent based on their preferences.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 8, 3, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 6, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while minimizing envy.
