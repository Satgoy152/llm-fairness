Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  28  29  43  35  94  81  69  93
1  50  51  48  66  28  33  13  52  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we need to ensure that each agent receives a set of items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Additionally, each agent should receive an integer number of items, and all 9 items must be allocated.

Let's start by considering the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 82 + 28 + 29 + 43 + 35 + 94 + 81 + 69 + 93 = 554
- Agent 1's total valuation: 50 + 51 + 48 + 66 + 28 + 33 + 13 + 52 + 53 = 344

Now, let's consider a possible allocation that is as fair as possible:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0, 5, 6, 8.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 1, 2, 3, 7.

Given this, let's allocate items to each agent while trying to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 5, 6, 8.
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 2, 3, 7.
- We have one more item to allocate, item 4.

To decide who should get item 4, let's compare each agent's valuation of item 4:
- Agent 0 values item 4 at 35.
- Agent 1 values item 4 at 28.

Since Agent 0 values item 4 more, we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

Hence, the final allocation is:

- Agent 0: items 0, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Agent 1: items 1, 2, 3, 7

This allocation is relatively fair given the valuations and ensures all items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7]
}
```
