Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3  4   5   6   7   8
0  50  51  78   7  6  64  39   2  51
1  85  87  64  64  3  45  56  96  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items, and then consider various allocations to balance the values received by each agent.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations

- **Agent 0's Total Valuation:**
  \[
  50 + 51 + 78 + 7 + 6 + 64 + 39 + 2 + 51 = 348
  \]

- **Agent 1's Total Valuation:**
  \[
  85 + 87 + 64 + 64 + 3 + 45 + 56 + 96 + 68 = 568
  \]

### Step 2: Determine Allocation Strategy

We aim to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a "fair" share based on their own valuations. A straightforward approach involves considering each agent's highest-value items and attempting to distribute them to balance total valuations between the agents.

### Step 3: Allocation

#### Initial Allocation Consideration:
- **Agent 0** values items 2, 5, and 1 highly.
- **Agent 1** values items 1, 7, and 0 highly.

#### Preliminary Allocation:
1. **Allocate high-value items:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value: 78).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value: 87).

2. **Allocate remaining items to balance values:**
   - Agent 0 gets items: 5, 4, 3 (values: 64, 6, 7).
   - Agent 1 gets items: 7, 0, 8, 6 (values: 96, 85, 68, 56).

#### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0 Total Valuation:**
  - Items: 2, 5, 4, 3
  - Total Value: 78 + 64 + 6 + 7 = 155

- **Agent 1 Total Valuation:**
  - Items: 1, 7, 0, 8, 6
  - Total Value: 87 + 96 + 85 + 68 + 56 = 392

This allocation aims to minimize envy by giving each agent a set of items that they collectively value highly, even if one agent's total valuation is still larger due to the inherent discrepancy in the total values they assign.

### Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 4, 3],
    "1": [1, 7, 0, 8, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
