Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6   7   8
0  87  27  41  44  54  84  5  95  65
1  31  76  25  69  91  25  2  91  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 76 25 69 91 25  2 91 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim for each agent to feel they receive a fair share according to their own valuations. One method to achieve this is to use the adjusted winner procedure or to simply allocate items to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that neither agent envies the other.

Given the values provided in the table, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0: 87 + 27 + 41 + 44 + 54 + 84 + 5 + 95 + 65 = 502
- Agent 1: 31 + 76 + 25 + 69 + 91 + 25 + 2 + 91 + 54 = 464

Next, we can allocate items by maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring fairness:

1. Assign items that are valued significantly higher by one agent compared to the other to that agent.
2. Keep track of the total value each agent receives to maintain a balance.

Using this approach, let's determine a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values items: 0 (87 vs. 31), 5 (84 vs. 25), 7 (95 vs. 91)
- Agent 1 highly values items: 1 (76 vs. 27), 4 (91 vs. 54)

Allocating these items:

- Agent 0: [0, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]

Now, allocate the remaining items (2, 3, 6, 8) to balance total valuation:

- Consider item 2: Agent 0 values it more (41 vs. 25), assign to Agent 0.
- Consider item 3: Agent 1 values it more (69 vs. 44), assign to Agent 1.
- Consider item 6: Agent 0 values it more (5 vs. 2), assign to Agent 0.
- Consider item 8: Agent 0 values it more (65 vs. 54), assign to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: [1, 3, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, with Agent 0 having a total valuation of 377 and Agent 1 having a total valuation of 331. Both agents receive a fair share based on their own valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
