Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  58  12  57  21   6  64  50  76
1  99  36  24  86  13  99  12  69  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the total value of the items based on their own valuations.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(12 + 58 + 12 + 57 + 21 + 6 + 64 + 50 + 76 = 356\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(99 + 36 + 24 + 86 + 13 + 99 + 12 + 69 + 42 = 480\)

Next, we aim to allocate items such that each agent receives approximately half of the total value according to their own valuations.

To achieve this, we will allocate items using the following strategy:
1. Sort items by the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Allocate items to the agent who values them more, while checking if this allocation leads to a balanced distribution of total value.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (99 vs. 12).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (58 vs. 36).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (24 vs. 12).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (86 vs. 57).
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (21 vs. 13).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (99 vs. 6).
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (64 vs. 12).
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (50 vs. 69).
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it more (76 vs. 42).

Using this approach, let's assign items:

- Agent 0: [1, 4, 6, 8]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 3, 5, 7]

Now, let's check the total valuation for each agent based on their allocations:

- Agent 0's total value from allocated items: \(58 + 21 + 64 + 76 = 219\)
- Agent 1's total value from allocated items: \(99 + 24 + 86 + 99 + 69 = 377\)

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items such that each agent receives a significant portion of the total value according to their own valuations, aiming towards a fair division.
