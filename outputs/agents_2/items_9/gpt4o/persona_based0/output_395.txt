Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  45  72   9  81  61  69  84  60
1  47  85  65  71  19  30  57  94  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is envy-free (or as close to envy-free as possible), we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. Here’s how we can proceed:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: Start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items.

    - Agent 0's total valuation: 75 + 45 + 72 + 9 + 81 + 61 + 69 + 84 + 60 = 556
    - Agent 1's total valuation: 47 + 85 + 65 + 71 + 19 + 30 + 57 + 94 + 12 = 480

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy**: Sort the items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents. This approach helps to identify which items are more valuable to one agent relative to the other.

3. **Allocate Items**: Allocate items to the agent who values them more, while attempting to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 at 47. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 at 85. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 at 65. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 at 71. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 at 19. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 at 30. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 at 57. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 at 94. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 at 12. Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let’s check the total valuations for each agent:

- Total value for Agent 0: 75 + 72 + 81 + 61 + 69 + 60 = 418
- Total value for Agent 1: 85 + 71 + 94 = 250

This allocation ensures that each agent has received a fair set of items based on their valuations, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 7]
}
```
