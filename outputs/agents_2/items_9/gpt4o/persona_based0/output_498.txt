Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  87  61  71   1   6   9  32   0
1  77  99  68  87  15  22  12   3  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the items to the agents such that the division is fair and, ideally, envy-free. Envy-free means that each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as they value the bundle of any other agent.

Let's start by evaluating the total valuation of each agent across all items:

- Agent 0: \(2 + 87 + 61 + 71 + 1 + 6 + 9 + 32 + 0 = 269\)
- Agent 1: \(77 + 99 + 68 + 87 + 15 + 22 + 12 + 3 + 82 = 465\)

Next, we look for an allocation that balances the valuations as much as possible between the agents.

### Initial Allocation Strategy

1. **High Valuation Priority**: Allocate items that each agent values highly to them first.
2. **Balance Total Valuation**: Ensure that the total value of items allocated to each agent is as balanced as possible.

#### Allocation Process

- **Agent 1** values items 1, 3, and 8 highly. Allocate these to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** values item 1 highly (but less than Agent 1), but has second highest value for item 2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate the remaining items to balance the total value assigned to each agent.

Let's distribute remaining items based on balancing the total value:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 3, 8

### Calculating Final Valuation

- **Agent 0**: \(2 (item 0) + 61 (item 2) + 1 (item 4) + 6 (item 5) + 9 (item 6) + 32 (item 7) = 111\)
- **Agent 1**: \(99 (item 1) + 87 (item 3) + 82 (item 8) = 268\)

With this allocation, each agent has a fair share of items based on their valuations, and the division is reasonable in terms of valuations, given the constraints.

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed fairly between the agents based on their valuations, while keeping the allocation integer and ensuring all items are allocated.
