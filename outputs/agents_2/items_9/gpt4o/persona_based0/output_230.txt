Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  77  81  69   2  10  95  44  12
1  84   5  23  51  90  73  34   6  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair division, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations. We will use the concept of maximizing each agent's valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation.

First, let's sum the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0: \(30 + 77 + 81 + 69 + 2 + 10 + 95 + 44 + 12 = 420\)
- Agent 1: \(84 + 5 + 23 + 51 + 90 + 73 + 34 + 6 + 57 = 423\)

Given the total valuations, we aim to allocate items such that the perceived value for each agent is approximately equal or as fair as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation step by step:

1. **Agent 0 - Highest Valuation Items:**
   - Item 6: Value 95
   - Item 2: Value 81
   - Item 1: Value 77
   - Item 3: Value 69

2. **Agent 1 - Highest Valuation Items:**
   - Item 0: Value 84
   - Item 4: Value 90
   - Item 5: Value 73
   - Item 8: Value 57

Now, let's check if each agent feels they have a fair allocation:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(95 + 81 + 77 + 69 = 322\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(84 + 90 + 73 + 57 = 304\)

Agent 0 receives items that are of higher individual value compared to agent 1, which may cause envy. We need to adjust this allocation to prevent envy by redistributing some items.

Let's attempt a different allocation strategy:

- Allocate items to balance the total valuation better between both agents.

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0: [2, 3, 6, 8]**
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: \(81 + 69 + 95 + 12 = 257\)

- **Agent 1: [0, 1, 4, 5, 7]**
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: \(84 + 5 + 90 + 73 + 6 = 258\)

This allocation ensures that both agents obtain a nearly equal share of their total perceived value, minimizing envy. Hereâ€™s the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fair division of items with minimal envy based on their valuations.
