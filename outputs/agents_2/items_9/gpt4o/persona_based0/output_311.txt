Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1   2  90  77  18  87  22  16  20
1  22  73   5  34  58  36  64  98  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents with the goal of achieving envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items.

Here is the valuation matrix for clarity:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 | Item 8 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 1      | 2      | 90     | 77     | 18     | 87     | 22     | 16     | 20     |
| 1     | 22     | 73     | 5      | 34     | 58     | 36     | 64     | 98     | 99     |

The goal is to allocate all 9 items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

One potential approach is to use the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or similar fair division methods. However, given the small scale of this problem, it might be more straightforward to manually allocate items to balance the total valuation each agent receives as equitably as possible.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent could potentially receive for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 1 + 2 + 90 + 77 + 18 + 87 + 22 + 16 + 20 = 333
- Agent 1's total valuation: 22 + 73 + 5 + 34 + 58 + 36 + 64 + 98 + 99 = 489

Now, let's allocate the items by attempting to balance the total values, aiming for each agent to be satisfied with their allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 2, 3, and 5.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 1, 7, and 8.

By attempting to balance the total value each receives, let's make the following allocations:

- Assign to Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Assign to Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 7, 8

Let's check the total valuation each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives: 1 (item 0) + 90 (item 2) + 77 (item 3) + 87 (item 5) + 22 (item 6) = 277
- Agent 1 receives: 73 (item 1) + 58 (item 4) + 98 (item 7) + 99 (item 8) = 328

This allocation provides an approximately balanced valuation in terms of each agent's preferences, striving for fairness.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
