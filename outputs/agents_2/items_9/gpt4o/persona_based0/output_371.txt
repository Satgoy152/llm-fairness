Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  6  54  54  90  28  20  90  81
1  12  1  83  78  78  79  21  40  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that ensures envy-freeness, one approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent has for the items they receive while trying to balance the valuations as closely as possible. We will analyze the valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

Agent 0's valuations:
- 0: 15
- 1: 6
- 2: 54
- 3: 54
- 4: 90
- 5: 28
- 6: 20
- 7: 90
- 8: 81

Agent 1's valuations:
- 0: 12
- 1: 1
- 2: 83
- 3: 78
- 4: 78
- 5: 79
- 6: 21
- 7: 40
- 8: 47

Let's allocate the items to maximize fairness:

1. Items that both agents highly value will be key in the allocation.
2. We will try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Allocating items:
- Agent 0 highly values items 4 and 7, and they are also valued highly by Agent 1. To create a fair allocation, we can allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (90) and item 7 to Agent 1 (40).
- Agent 1 highly values item 2 and item 5. We allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (83) and item 5 to Agent 0 (28).
- Agent 0 also highly values item 8, so we allocate it to Agent 0 (81).
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly, so we allocate it to Agent 1 (78).
- The remaining items 0, 1, and 6 can be allocated to balance the total value:
  - Allocate item 0 (15) and item 6 (20) to Agent 0.
  - Allocate item 1 (1) to Agent 1.

Checking the allocations:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 15 + 90 + 28 + 20 + 81 = 234
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 3, 7
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 1 + 83 + 78 + 40 = 202

The allocations are fairly balanced given the constraints and maximize the total valuation each agent receives without causing significant envy.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7]
}
```
