Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  27   4  54   5  10  63  73  29
1  63   6  27  80  81  78  76  56  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, I will aim for an envy-free distribution. This means that each agent should feel that they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0: 60 + 27 + 4 + 54 + 5 + 10 + 63 + 73 + 29 = 367
- Agent 1: 63 + 6 + 27 + 80 + 81 + 78 + 76 + 56 + 14 = 481

The goal is to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received the best possible allocation according to their valuations.

To start, consider the highest-valued items for each agent. Allocating these should maximize the perceived value for each agent. The highest-valued items for each agent are:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the highest at 73.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 81.

Let's allocate these high-value items to the respective agents:

1. Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, let's continue to assign items to balance the allocations:

Agent 0's remaining high-value items:
- Item 6: 63
- Item 0: 60
- Item 3: 54

Agent 1's remaining high-value items:
- Item 3: 80
- Item 5: 78
- Item 6: 76

We will continue by allocating items to maintain balance:

3. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (valued at 80 by Agent 1).
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (valued at 63 by Agent 0).
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (valued at 78 by Agent 1).

Now both agents have received three items each. Let's assign the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 0, 1, 2, 8

6. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (valued at 60 by Agent 0).
7. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (valued at 27 by Agent 0).
8. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (valued at 27 by Agent 1).
9. Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (valued at 14 by Agent 1).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [7, 6, 0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 3, 5, 2, 8]

This allocation ensures both agents receive a fair distribution based on their valuations.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6, 0, 1],
    "1": [4, 3, 5, 2, 8]
}
```
