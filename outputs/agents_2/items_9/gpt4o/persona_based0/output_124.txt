Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  11  23  87  46   6  24  74  48
1  95  18  67  53  95  94   4  55  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and achieve a fair distribution. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent should be at least as happy with their allocation as they would be with the other agent's allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [13, 11, 23, 87, 46, 6, 24, 74, 48]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [95, 18, 67, 53, 95, 94, 4, 55, 76]

A fair approach involves ensuring that the total value each agent perceives from their allocation is as balanced as possible. One method to achieve this is by applying the "adjusted winner" procedure or similar strategies that attempt to equalize perceived value.

Let's consider an allocation:

1. **High Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 1 highly values items 0 and 4 (both valued at 95).
   - Agent 0 highly values item 3 (valued at 87).

2. **Balancing Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0 can be assigned item 3 (87), item 7 (74), item 8 (48).
   - Agent 1 can be assigned item 0 (95), item 4 (95), item 5 (94).

3. **Distributing Items for Balance:**
   - Agent 0 can get items 1 (11) and 2 (23) to balance the allocation.
   - Agent 1 gets items 6 (4).

Let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 2, 3, 7, 8] = [11, 23, 87, 74, 48]
- Agent 1: [0, 4, 5, 6] = [95, 95, 94, 4]

Now, present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent perceives, reducing potential envy and maintaining fairness within the constraints.
