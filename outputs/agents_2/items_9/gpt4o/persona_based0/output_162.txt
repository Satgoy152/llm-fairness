Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  89  81  13  14  28  49   0  67
1  76   8  52  12  47  71  27  17  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90 89 81 13 14 28 49  0 67]
 [76  8 52 12 47 71 27 17 40]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the 9 items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, meaning each agent should prefer or at least be indifferent to their own allocation compared to what the other agent receives. We will aim to maximize the value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.

Let's first list the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [90, 89, 81, 13, 14, 28, 49, 0, 67]
- Agent 1: [76, 8, 52, 12, 47, 71, 27, 17, 40]

A straightforward way to achieve a fair and envy-free allocation is to start by assigning the highest valued items to the agents that value them the most, while ensuring the number of items remains balanced.

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (90 > 76)
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (89 > 8)
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (81 > 52)
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (12 > 13)
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (47 > 14)
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (71 > 28)
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (49 > 27)
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (17 > 0)
9. Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (67 > 40)

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2, 6, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4, 5, 7]

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. The allocations should be free of envy as each agent is getting high-valued items according to their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
