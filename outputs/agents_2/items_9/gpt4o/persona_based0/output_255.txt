Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6   7   8
0  95  46  14  56  63  61  6  27  13
1  79  99  91  43  20  47  1  77  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation for each item. The goal is to maximize the perceived value for each agent given their preferences, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated sums precisely to 9.

Here is one approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Determine the total value each agent assigns to all items. This helps in understanding how each agent values the entire set of items.

   - Agent 0's total valuation: 95 + 46 + 14 + 56 + 63 + 61 + 6 + 27 + 13 = 381
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 79 + 99 + 91 + 43 + 20 + 47 + 1 + 77 + 70 = 527

2. **Assign Items Based on Preference**: Start by assigning items that are most valued by each agent, trying to balance the overall distribution of value.

3. **Trial and Adjustment**: Adjust assignments to ensure that both agents feel they are receiving a fair share based on their valuation.

Let's determine an allocation where each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences:

- Agent 0 prioritizes items: 0, 4, 5, 3
- Agent 1 prioritizes items: 1, 2, 8, 7

After considering various combinations, a fair distribution could be:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items valued highly by them, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]
}
```
