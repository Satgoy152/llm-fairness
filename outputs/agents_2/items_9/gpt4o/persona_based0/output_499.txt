Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  11  23   6  61  38  65  56  29
1  61  75  61  66  60  71   1  73  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**

   - **Agent 0 Total Valuation:** 58 + 11 + 23 + 6 + 61 + 38 + 65 + 56 + 29 = 347
   - **Agent 1 Total Valuation:** 61 + 75 + 61 + 66 + 60 + 71 + 1 + 73 + 57 = 525

2. **Determine Proportional Share:**

   - **Agent 0 Proportional Share:** 347 / (347 + 525) = 0.398
   - **Agent 1 Proportional Share:** 525 / (347 + 525) = 0.602

With these shares, Agent 0 should get approximately 3.58 items (round to 4), and Agent 1 should get approximately 5.42 items (round to 5).

3. **Allocate Items with Envy-Freeness in Mind:**

   - Sort items based on the difference in valuation between the two agents (Agent 1's valuation - Agent 0's valuation). This helps to identify items that are more valuable to one agent than the other.

   ```
   Difference List (Agent 1 - Agent 0):
   Item 1: 75 - 11 = 64
   Item 3: 66 - 6 = 60
   Item 5: 71 - 38 = 33
   Item 7: 73 - 56 = 17
   Item 8: 57 - 29 = 28
   Item 0: 61 - 58 = 3
   Item 4: 60 - 61 = -1
   Item 2: 61 - 23 = 38
   Item 6: 1 - 65 = -64
   ```

   - Allocate items with the highest positive differences to Agent 1 and items with the highest negative differences to Agent 0.

4. **Final Allocation:**

   - **Agent 1:** Allocate items 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8 (5 items).
   - **Agent 0:** Allocate items 0, 2, 4, and 6 (4 items).

This allocation gives both agents a set of items they value highly, and it maintains the proportional share as closely as possible while ensuring envy-freeness.

### Allocations

    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7, 8]
