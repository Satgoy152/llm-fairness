Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  46  70   6   0  48  22  96  93
1  60  77  18  16  74  88  60  87  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-freeness in allocating items to agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item and attempt to balance the total value each agent receives. We aim to distribute the items such that neither agent envies the other's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's start by calculating the total valuations for each agent if they were to receive all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation for all items: 22 + 46 + 70 + 6 + 0 + 48 + 22 + 96 + 93 = 403
- Agent 1's total valuation for all items: 60 + 77 + 18 + 16 + 74 + 88 + 60 + 87 + 93 = 573

Since there are 9 items, each agent should ideally receive items that sum to half the total valuation, but since the total number of items is odd, perfect balance might not be possible. Nonetheless, we aim to make the allocation as fair as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Sort items based on the difference in valuations between agents.
2. Prioritize giving each item to the agent who values it the most while ensuring the total number of items allocated is balanced.
3. Check for envy-freeness and adjust if necessary.

Here's one way we could allocate:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8

### Calculation of Allocated Values:
- Agent 0's allocated value: 22 (item 0) + 70 (item 2) + 48 (item 5) + 22 (item 6) = 162
- Agent 1's allocated value: 77 (item 1) + 16 (item 3) + 74 (item 4) + 87 (item 7) + 93 (item 8) = 347

This allocation gives each agent a set of items, and while Agent 1 receives more total value, the distribution is based on each agent's preferences and attempts to minimize envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
