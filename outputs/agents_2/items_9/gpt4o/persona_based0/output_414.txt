Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  65  30  15  41  58  42  36  94
1  27  64  22  37  41  85   8  49  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a simple approach to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value. The goal is to divide the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation and perceives it as fair compared to the other agent's allocation.

Here is one way to approach the problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: First, calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items. This will help us understand how much each agent values the entire set of items.

2. **Item Prioritization**: Next, create a list of items for each agent based on their individual valuations in descending order. This will help us determine which items each agent values most.

3. **Greedy Allocation**: Allocate items one by one based on the highest valuation for each agent, alternating between agents to try and balance the allocation in terms of perceived value.

4. **Balance and Adjust**: After the initial allocation, check for any imbalances and adjust as necessary to ensure the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

Let's perform these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation
- **Agent 0**: 72 + 65 + 30 + 15 + 41 + 58 + 42 + 36 + 94 = 453
- **Agent 1**: 27 + 64 + 22 + 37 + 41 + 85 + 8 + 49 + 90 = 423

### Step 2: Item Prioritization
- **Agent 0's preferences**: [8, 0, 1, 5, 6, 4, 7, 2, 3]
- **Agent 1's preferences**: [5, 8, 1, 7, 3, 4, 0, 2, 6]

### Step 3: Greedy Allocation
- **Round 1**: Allocate item 8 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- **Round 2**: Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- **Round 3**: Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Round 4**: Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Round 5**: Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- **Round 6**: Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
- **Round 7**: Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- **Round 8**: Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Round 9**: Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

### Step 4: Balance and Adjust
- Both agents have 4 items each. Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets 4 or 5 items. Let's check this allocation:

Agent 0: [8, 0, 6, 4, 2]  
Agent 1: [5, 1, 7, 3]

Agent 0 receives items with values: 94, 72, 42, 41, 30.  
Agent 1 receives items with values: 85, 64, 49, 37.

### Final Allocations
```json
{
    "0": [8, 0, 6, 4, 2],
    "1": [5, 1, 7, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a number of items based on their preferences, aiming to minimize envy.
