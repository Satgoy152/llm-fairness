Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  89  83  70  28  79  41  73  92
1  71  89  54  43  55  30  74  37  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[36 89 83 70 28 79 41 73 92]
 [71 89 54 43 55 30 74 37 24]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations for each item, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the set of items assigned to another agent over their own set.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [36, 89, 83, 70, 28, 79, 41, 73, 92]
Agent 1: [71, 89, 54, 43, 55, 30, 74, 37, 24]
```

We will attempt to split the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the total value.

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - Agent 0 values: 591 total
   - Agent 1 values: 477 total

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - We aim for each agent to receive a total value that's approximately half of their own total valuation, while prioritizing items that they value more than the other agent.

3. **Fair Allocation**:
   - Assign items 1, 2, 5, 7, 8 to Agent 0, which they value more highly than Agent 1. 
   - Assign items 0, 3, 4, 6 to Agent 1.

4. **Check**:
   - Allocated totals for Agent 0: 89 + 83 + 79 + 73 + 92 = 416
   - Allocated totals for Agent 1: 71 + 43 + 55 + 74 = 243

5. **Conclusion**:
   - This allocation minimizes envy as both agents receive a significant portion of their valued items.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
