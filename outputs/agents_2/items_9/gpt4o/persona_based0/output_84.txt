Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  28  18  22  20  33  27  54  31
1   0  13  99  14  96  94  49  28  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness is achieved when each agent values their allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent.

Let's evaluate the total valuation of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 26 + 28 + 18 + 22 + 20 + 33 + 27 + 54 + 31 = 259
- Agent 1's total valuation: 0 + 13 + 99 + 14 + 96 + 94 + 49 + 28 + 67 = 360

Now, let's aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly and attempt to balance the total value each agent perceives from their allocation.

Starting with agent 1, since they have higher valuations for certain items:
- Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value of 99)
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value of 96)
- Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value of 94)
- Assign item 8 to agent 1 (value of 67)

These items are highly valued by agent 1, making them less envious of agent 0's allocation.

Now, assign the remaining items to agent 0:
- Assign item 0 to agent 0
- Assign item 1 to agent 0
- Assign item 3 to agent 0
- Assign item 6 to agent 0
- Assign item 7 to agent 0

These items are chosen because they provide a balance of value to agent 0 given the remaining options, and they are less valuable to agent 1.

Let's list the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items, and the total number of items distributed is 9.
