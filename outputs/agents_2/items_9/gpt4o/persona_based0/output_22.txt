Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  34  13  73  95  36  23  89  54
1  18  90  40  91  25  68  69  66  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 34 13 73 95 36 23 89 54]
 [18 90 40 91 25 68 69 66 42]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent believes they have received the most valuable bundle of items according to their own valuation.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent if they were to receive all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(42 + 34 + 13 + 73 + 95 + 36 + 23 + 89 + 54 = 459\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(18 + 90 + 40 + 91 + 25 + 68 + 69 + 66 + 42 = 509\)

To achieve a fair division, we should consider allocating items such that the perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

To start, let's identify the highest valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (95), followed by item 7 (89), and item 3 (73).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (91), followed by item 1 (90), and item 6 (69).

To ensure fairness, we'll consider these preferences in allocating items:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 as they value it the highest.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 as they value it the highest.
3. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (second highest for Agent 0).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (second highest for Agent 1).
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (next high value for Agent 0).
6. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (next high value for Agent 1).
7. Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (next high value for Agent 0).
8. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (next high value for Agent 1).
9. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (remaining item, better value for Agent 1 than 0).

Let's summarize the allocation:

Agent 0 receives items: 4, 7, 0, 8  
Agent 1 receives items: 3, 1, 6, 2, 5

Now, let's verify the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuation for their items: \(95 + 89 + 42 + 54 = 280\)
- Agent 1's valuation for their items: \(91 + 90 + 69 + 40 + 68 = 358\)

These allocations ensure that each agent receives the highest possible value according to their preferences, and the allocation is fair given the valuation matrix.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
