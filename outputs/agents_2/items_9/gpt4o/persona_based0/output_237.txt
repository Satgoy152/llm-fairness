Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  79  29  47  77  65  27  58  74
1  25  13  73  95  54  57  95  24  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly between the two agents, we want to ensure that neither agent feels envious of the other. This means that each agent should value their own allocation at least as much as they value the other agent's allocation. We'll use the concept of envy-freeness to guide our allocation.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 18 + 79 + 29 + 47 + 77 + 65 + 27 + 58 + 74 = 474
- Agent 1's total value: 25 + 13 + 73 + 95 + 54 + 57 + 95 + 24 + 73 = 509

Next, we will look for an allocation that is as balanced as possible in terms of total value for each agent while ensuring envy-freeness.

One possible allocation strategy is to use a greedy algorithm, where each agent picks the item they value the most from the remaining pool of items, one at a time, until all items are allocated. Let's follow this procedure:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 95).
   - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 79).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 77).
   - Agent 1 picks item 6 (value 95).

3. **Round 3:**
   - Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 73).
   - Agent 0 picks item 8 (value 74).

4. **Round 4:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 65).
   - Agent 1 picks item 7 (value 24).

5. **Final item:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 18).

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 4, 8, 5, 0] with values [79, 77, 74, 65, 18] totaling 313.
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 6, 2, 7] with values [95, 95, 73, 24] totaling 311.

This allocation is close in value and aims to be envy-free. Agent 0 values their allocation at 313, and Agent 1 values their allocation at 311. Neither agent envies the other's allocation based on their own valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 8, 5, 0],
    "1": [3, 6, 2, 7]
}
```
