Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85   4   2  50  89  49  59  40  85
1  67  90  73  76  36  80  19  78  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring that the allocations are envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, a common approach is to try to maximize the minimum value each agent receives. This is essentially a problem of maximizing fairness given the constraints.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(85 + 4 + 2 + 50 + 89 + 49 + 59 + 40 + 85 = 463\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(67 + 90 + 73 + 76 + 36 + 80 + 19 + 78 + 76 = 595\)

Given that Agent 1 values the items more highly on average, an initial attempt might involve giving them more items. However, we need to ensure that each agent feels that they have received a fair share relative to their valuations.

Let's try an allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent and try to distribute them such that each agent gets their most valued items proportionately to their total valuation.

2. Distribute the remaining items to balance the fairness.

Below is an allocation that attempts to achieve this:

- Agent 0's highest valued items: Items 0, 4, 8 (valuations: 85, 89, 85 respectively).
- Agent 1's highest valued items: Items 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 (valuations: 90, 73, 76, 80, 78 respectively).

Now let's allocate:

- Agent 0 receives: Items 0, 4, 8 (total valuation: \(85 + 89 + 85 = 259\))
- Agent 1 receives: Items 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 (total valuation: \(90 + 73 + 76 + 80 + 78 = 397\))

We have allocated 8 items. We still need to allocate one more item:

- The remaining items are 6, with valuations 59 for Agent 0 and 19 for Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0, which maximizes their remaining value.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0 receives: Items 0, 4, 6, 8 (total valuation: \(85 + 89 + 59 + 85 = 318\))
- Agent 1 receives: Items 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 (total valuation: \(90 + 73 + 76 + 80 + 78 = 397\))

This allocation provides a balance based on the valuation preferences of both agents. Now, presenting the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
