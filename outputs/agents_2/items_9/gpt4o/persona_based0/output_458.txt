Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  52  36  19  40  26  81  44  37
1  32  91  53  37  75  79  25  55   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can apply a method that considers each agent's valuation of the items. One way to approach this is by using the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or a similar method that attempts to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's total valuation of their assigned items.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(76 + 52 + 36 + 19 + 40 + 26 + 81 + 44 + 37 = 411\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(32 + 91 + 53 + 37 + 75 + 79 + 25 + 55 + 8 = 455\)

Next, we'll aim to allocate the items such that the total valuation each agent receives is as balanced as possible, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify high-value items**: We should start by looking at the items each agent values the most and try to distribute them to maximize individual satisfaction.

2. **Allocate items**:
   - Agent 0 values items 6 (81), 0 (76), and 1 (52) highly.
   - Agent 1 values items 1 (91), 5 (79), and 4 (75) highly.

3. **Distribute based on high valuation**:
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 since it's their highest valuation.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 since it's their highest valuation.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 and item 5 to Agent 1.

4. **Balance the remaining items**:
   - Evaluate remaining items: 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 due to higher valuation.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 due to higher valuation.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 and item 7 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 0 due to higher valuation.

### Final Allocation:

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that no agent is envious of the other's allocation.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0's total valuation: \(76 + 36 + 19 + 81 + 37 = 249\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(91 + 75 + 79 + 55 = 300\)

This allocation provides each agent with a set of items that collectively have a high valuation, aiming to reduce envy and ensure a fair division based on their preferences.
