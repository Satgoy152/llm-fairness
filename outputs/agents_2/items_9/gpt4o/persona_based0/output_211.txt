Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  26  51  97  19   8  76  98  59
1  56  43  87  30  77  92  90  25  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents in a way that is envy-free, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations, minimizing envy. Given the valuations, we can employ a strategy to achieve this.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items and then attempt to split the items such that the distribution of total value approximates equality.

Agent 0's total valuation:
- 80 + 26 + 51 + 97 + 19 + 8 + 76 + 98 + 59 = 514

Agent 1's total valuation:
- 56 + 43 + 87 + 30 + 77 + 92 + 90 + 25 + 30 = 530

Now, let's allocate the items by considering the relative valuations of the agents for each item:

1. Both agents have nearly equal total valuations, so the distribution should aim to give each agent approximately half of the total valuation.

2. The strategy is to allocate items to agents based on maximizing the total value each agent receives by selecting high-value items for each agent while balancing the overall distribution.

3. We'll use a simple greedy approach where each agent takes turns choosing the item with the highest personal valuation that hasn't been allocated yet. This often leads to an allocation where each agent feels they have received valuable items.

Let's assign the items:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (97), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (92), so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 then takes item 7 (98).
- Agent 1 then takes item 2 (87).
- Agent 0 then takes item 0 (80).
- Agent 1 then takes item 6 (90).
- Agent 0 then takes item 6 (76).
- Agent 1 then takes item 4 (77).
- Agent 0 then takes the remaining item 1 (26).
- Agent 1 then takes the remaining item 8 (30).

Now let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of the total valuation based on their individual preferences.
