Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  50  63  88  60   6  40  92  61
1  75  78  64  34  83  26  15  86  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [75 78 64 34 83 26 15 86 60]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents, we aim to allocate items such that neither agent envies the other's allocation, or the envy is minimized. This often involves ensuring that the total valuation each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each item from each agent's perspective:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Items: 0 (73), 1 (50), 2 (63), 3 (88), 4 (60), 5 (6), 6 (40), 7 (92), 8 (61)
- Total valuation: 73 + 50 + 63 + 88 + 60 + 6 + 40 + 92 + 61 = 533

Agent 1's valuations:
- Items: 0 (75), 1 (78), 2 (64), 3 (34), 4 (83), 5 (26), 6 (15), 7 (86), 8 (60)
- Total valuation: 75 + 78 + 64 + 34 + 83 + 26 + 15 + 86 + 60 = 521

Next, we try to allocate the items such that each agent's total valuation of their bundle is as close as possible.

Let's start the allocation:

1. Assign items to Agent 0 based on higher relative valuations compared to Agent 1:
   - Item 3 (88 vs. 34)
   - Item 5 (6 vs. 26)
   - Item 6 (40 vs. 15)
   - Item 7 (92 vs. 86)

2. Assign items to Agent 1 based on higher relative valuations compared to Agent 0:
   - Item 1 (50 vs. 78)
   - Item 4 (60 vs. 83)
   - Item 8 (61 vs. 60)

3. Remaining items (0, 2) are allocated to balance the total valuation:

   Agent 0: Already has items 3, 5, 6, 7 with valuations 88, 6, 40, 92. Total: 226
   Agent 1: Already has items 1, 4, 8 with valuations 78, 83, 60. Total: 221

   Adding item 0 (valuations: 73 vs. 75):
   - Assign to Agent 1 (221 + 75 = 296)

   Adding item 2 (valuations: 63 vs. 64):
   - Assign to Agent 0 (226 + 63 = 289)

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 5, 6, 7, 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 8, 0

Total valuations:
- Agent 0: 289
- Agent 1: 296

This allocation is quite balanced. Both agents have received a similar total valuation.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6, 7, 2],
    "1": [1, 4, 8, 0]
}
```
