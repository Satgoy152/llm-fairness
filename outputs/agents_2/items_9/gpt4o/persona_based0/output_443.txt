Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3  4   5   6   7   8
0  85  22  31  36  7  59  54  51  75
1  41  42  33  30  0  42  32  89  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness and complete allocation, we can use a simple approach to maximize the perceived value each agent derives from their allocation. This involves assigning items to agents in a way that keeps the distribution as balanced as possible in terms of each agent's total valuation.

Let's begin by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 85 + 22 + 31 + 36 + 7 + 59 + 54 + 51 + 75 = 420
- Agent 1's total valuation: 41 + 42 + 33 + 30 + 0 + 42 + 32 + 89 + 66 = 375

Next, we'll use a greedy approach to allocate the items, aiming to keep the total value each agent receives as balanced as possible. We'll start by assigning items that maximize the difference in valuations between the two agents, which helps in reducing envy.

### Allocation Process:
1. Rank the items by the absolute difference in value between the two agents (from highest to lowest).
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more.

Let's calculate the differences and allocate:

- Item 0: 85 vs 41, difference = 44 (allocate to Agent 0)
- Item 1: 22 vs 42, difference = 20 (allocate to Agent 1)
- Item 2: 31 vs 33, difference = 2 (allocate to Agent 1)
- Item 3: 36 vs 30, difference = 6 (allocate to Agent 0)
- Item 4: 7 vs 0, difference = 7 (allocate to Agent 0)
- Item 5: 59 vs 42, difference = 17 (allocate to Agent 0)
- Item 6: 54 vs 32, difference = 22 (allocate to Agent 0)
- Item 7: 51 vs 89, difference = 38 (allocate to Agent 1)
- Item 8: 75 vs 66, difference = 9 (allocate to Agent 0)

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 (Total value = 85 + 36 + 7 + 59 + 54 + 75 = 316)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 7 (Total value = 42 + 33 + 89 = 164)

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value within this framework.
