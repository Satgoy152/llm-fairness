Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  67  65  76  30  51  59  82  35
1  47  95  76  11  84  64  74  67  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 95 76 11 84 64 74 67 36]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation where both agents feel that they are receiving their fair share based on their valuations. We will use the information provided in the table to determine an allocation that minimizes envy.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 5 + 67 + 65 + 76 + 30 + 51 + 59 + 82 + 35 = 470
- Agent 1: 47 + 95 + 76 + 11 + 84 + 64 + 74 + 67 + 36 = 554

Next, let's attempt to allocate the items in a way that makes the total value for each agent as close as possible, while ensuring that each agent prefers their own allocation to the other's.

We'll start by considering the highest valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0's highest valued items: 82 (item 7), 76 (item 3), 67 (item 1)
- Agent 1's highest valued items: 95 (item 1), 84 (item 4), 76 (item 2)

Given the overlap in item 1, we will allocate the items focusing on maximizing fairness and minimizing envy:

1. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (valued at 82).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (valued at 76).
3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (valued at 95).
4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (valued at 84).
5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (valued at 76).

Now we have:

- Agent 0: Items 7, 3 (Value: 82 + 76 = 158)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 2 (Value: 95 + 84 + 76 = 255)

Next, we continue allocating the remaining items to balance the values:

6. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 47).
7. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 51).
8. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 59).
9. Allocate item 8 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 35).

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 7, 3, 5, 6, 8 (Value: 82 + 76 + 51 + 59 + 35 = 303)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 2, 0 (Value: 95 + 84 + 76 + 47 = 302)

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives and should minimize envy between the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 2, 0]
}
```
