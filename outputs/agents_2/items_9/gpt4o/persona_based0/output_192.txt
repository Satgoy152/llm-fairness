Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  88  34   1  92  12  64  41  94
1  57  11  54  80  31  20  40  71  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we aim to allocate items such that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free Matching" method, where we attempt to maximize the minimum satisfaction across agents.

First, let's list the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 35 + 88 + 34 + 1 + 92 + 12 + 64 + 41 + 94 = 461
- Agent 1: 57 + 11 + 54 + 80 + 31 + 20 + 40 + 71 + 84 = 448

Next, we need to allocate items to balance these values as evenly as possible. We must ensure that each agent ends up with a similar total valuation of their allocated items.

To achieve this, consider the following allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Items: 0, 1, 4, 6
  - Total Valuation: 35 + 88 + 92 + 64 = 279

- Agent 1:
  - Items: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
  - Total Valuation: 54 + 80 + 20 + 71 + 84 = 277

This allocation gives both agents a total valuation that is approximately equal, which helps in maintaining fairness and minimizing envy.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
