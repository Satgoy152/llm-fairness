Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  20  90  19  95  71  15  44  20
1  77  59  79  87  78  57  42  75  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items between the two agents while minimizing envy, we can use an approach inspired by the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or similar fair division methods. The goal is to allocate items such that each agent's total perceived value is as balanced as possible, reducing potential envy.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total value = 56 + 20 + 90 + 19 + 95 + 71 + 15 + 44 + 20 = 430
- Agent 1's total value = 77 + 59 + 79 + 87 + 78 + 57 + 42 + 75 + 74 = 628

Next, we will allocate items to balance the perceived value each agent receives. We'll start by allocating items to the agent who values them more, and then adjust to balance the total values.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 1 values it more (77 vs. 56). Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Agent 1 values it more (59 vs. 20). Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 0 values it more (90 vs. 79). Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Agent 1 values it more (87 vs. 19). Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:** 
   - Agent 0 values it more (95 vs. 78). Allocate to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5:** 
   - Agent 0 values it more (71 vs. 57). Allocate to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6:** 
   - Agent 1 values it more (42 vs. 15). Allocate to Agent 1.

8. **Item 7:** 
   - Agent 1 values it more (75 vs. 44). Allocate to Agent 1.

9. **Item 8:** 
   - Agent 1 values it more (74 vs. 20). Allocate to Agent 1.

### Summary of Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation seeks to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. The distribution aims to balance the total perceived values each agent receives, which helps in reducing potential envy.
