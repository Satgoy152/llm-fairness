Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  10   7  64  30  92   0  36  92
1  49  37  57  41  61  49  55  24   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to ensure each agent feels they receive a fair share based on their own valuations.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve an envy-free allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 37 + 10 + 7 + 64 + 30 + 92 + 0 + 36 + 92 = 368
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 49 + 37 + 57 + 41 + 61 + 49 + 55 + 24 + 5 = 378

2. **Proportional Fair Share:**
   - Each agent should ideally receive at least half of their total valuation, given there are 2 agents.
   - Agent 0 should receive at least 184 (half of 368).
   - Agent 1 should receive at least 189 (half of 378).

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by allocating the most valued items to each agent until they reach their proportional fair share.
   - Avoid giving any item to both agents.

4. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign items that have high value for each agent until the proportional fair share is met or exceeded.

Let's begin the allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Assign item 5 (value 92) to Agent 0.
  - Assign item 8 (value 92) to Agent 0.
  - Assign item 3 (value 64) to Agent 0.
  - Agent 0's total valuation now is: 92 + 92 + 64 = 248 (exceeds 184).

- **Agent 1**:
  - Assign item 2 (value 57) to Agent 1.
  - Assign item 4 (value 61) to Agent 1.
  - Assign item 6 (value 55) to Agent 1.
  - Agent 1's total valuation now is: 57 + 61 + 55 = 173 (less than 189).
  - Assign item 1 (value 37) to Agent 1.
  - Agent 1's total valuation now is: 173 + 37 = 210 (exceeds 189).

- Remaining items for Agent 0 to ensure all items are allocated:
  - Assign items 0 and 7 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8, 3, 0, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures both agents receive more than their proportional fair share, meeting the criteria for envy-freeness.
