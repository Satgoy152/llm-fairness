Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  34  97  26  92  14  69  22  62
1  86  15  44  22   1  60  68  68  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1) while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on each item and distribute the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their respective valuations.

Let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 50 + 34 + 97 + 26 + 92 + 14 + 69 + 22 + 62 = 466
- Agent 1's total value: 86 + 15 + 44 + 22 + 1 + 60 + 68 + 68 + 45 = 369

To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we aim to give each agent a bundle of items such that each agent values their own bundle at least as much as the other agent values their respective bundle.

Let's allocate items using a manual inspection of the valuations to reach a fair division:

1. **Allocate high-value items first:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 highly (97) and no other item similarly valued by Agent 1. Thus, assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 highly (86) and no other item similarly valued by Agent 0. Thus, assign item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Balance the allocation based on remaining high-value items:**
   - Agent 0 also values item 4 highly (92), which is not highly valued by Agent 1 (1). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 (60) and item 6 (68) significantly, while these items are not as highly valued by Agent 0. Assign items 5 and 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 8 at 62, which is significantly higher than Agent 1's valuation (45). Assign item 8 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 at 68, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation (22). Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 34, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation (15). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Finally, item 3 is valued equally low by both agents, but Agent 0 can receive it to balance the total number of items. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

After these allocations, the distribution is:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 4, 8, 1, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 5, 6, 7

This ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. 

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 8, 1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
