Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  22  40  77  59  37  25  98  85
1  33  55  17  25  37   9  32  22   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle, according to their valuations.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 35 + 22 + 40 + 77 + 59 + 37 + 25 + 98 + 85 = 478
- Agent 1's total valuation: 33 + 55 + 17 + 25 + 37 + 9 + 32 + 22 + 0 = 230

Next, let's attempt to allocate the items such that the envy is minimized or eliminated. We will aim to divide the items such that each agent receives a similar total valuation according to their preferences.

Since agent 0 values item 7 highly (98) and agent 1 values item 1 highly (55), we can start by allocating these items to their respective agents. We will continue this process to balance the total valuations for both agents.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Allocate items 0, 2, 4, 5, 7 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0's valuation: 35 + 40 + 59 + 37 + 98 = 269
   
2. Allocate items 1, 3, 6, 8 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1's valuation: 55 + 25 + 32 + 0 = 112

Note that this allocation aims to ensure that both agents have a fair share according to their valuations. Agent 0 has a higher total valuation initially, and the allocation reflects their higher overall valuation of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a bundle that reflects their preferences as closely as possible given the constraints.
