Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  47  68  78  81  69  26  69  72
1  77  27  95  19  85  38  89  70  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while trying to avoid envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives, thereby attempting to ensure that each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as the other agent's bundle.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items fairly:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:** First, calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items combined.
   - Agent 0: 90 + 47 + 68 + 78 + 81 + 69 + 26 + 69 + 72 = 600
   - Agent 1: 77 + 27 + 95 + 19 + 85 + 38 + 89 + 70 + 60 = 560

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy:** Try to allocate items such that the value each agent receives is as close as possible to their original total valuation share. Since there are 9 items, each agent should ideally receive around 4-5 items.

3. **Greedy Allocation:** Start by allocating items greedily based on the highest individual item valuation for each agent, while checking to maintain a fair balance in total value.

   - Agent 0's top valued items: 
     - Item 0: 90
     - Item 4: 81
     - Item 3: 78
     - Item 5: 69

   - Agent 1's top valued items:
     - Item 2: 95
     - Item 6: 89
     - Item 4: 85
     - Item 7: 70

4. **Adjust for Fairness:** Ensure that neither agent envies the other by adjusting allocations slightly if one agent's total valuation is too much higher than the other's.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Allocate items to balance the total value such that neither agent believes the other's allocation is more valuable than their own, based on their personal valuation.

After following this process, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, 5, 8 with values: 90, 78, 69, 72 = 309
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 with values: 27, 95, 85, 89, 70 = 366

This allocation ensures that each agent has a bundle of items they value highly, and the total values are relatively balanced, minimizing potential envy.
