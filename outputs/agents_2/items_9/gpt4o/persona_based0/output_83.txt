Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  51  45  19  70  95  98  22  88
1  99  24  24  65  42  96   9  90  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we need to consider their valuations for each item and attempt to balance the perceived value each agent receives. A common approach is to use the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or a similar heuristic to ensure allocations are as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of one possible fair allocation method:

1. **Determine Total Valuation**: Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
   - Agent 0 total valuation: 36 + 51 + 45 + 19 + 70 + 95 + 98 + 22 + 88 = 524
   - Agent 1 total valuation: 99 + 24 + 24 + 65 + 42 + 96 + 9 + 90 + 97 = 546

2. **Initial Allocation**: Start by allocating items based on the highest valuation difference to each agent, aiming to equalize the total value received by each.

3. **Greedy Allocation**: Assign items to the agent who values them most, one by one, checking frequently to ensure the overall value distribution remains as balanced as possible.

4. **Adjustment**: If any imbalances are detected, make small adjustments by switching items between agents to improve fairness.

Following these steps, here's an allocation that attempts to be fair and envy-free:

- Assign items based on their highest value to each agent, and ensure the total value received is balanced.

Using this approach, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: [5, 6, 7, 8]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 95 + 98 + 22 + 88 = 303

- Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 99 + 24 + 24 + 65 + 42 = 254

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation received by each agent while ensuring each agent gets items they highly value.

The allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation keeps the number of items balanced and attempts to distribute the total perceived value as evenly as possible, given the constraints.
