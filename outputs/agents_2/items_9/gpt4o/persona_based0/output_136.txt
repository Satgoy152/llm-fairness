Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  99  95  55  64  35  69  37  36
1  15  56  35  74  66  65  52   8  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents with the goal of minimizing envy and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent perceives from their allocated items. This helps in achieving an envy-free allocation.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 87 + 99 + 95 + 55 + 64 + 35 + 69 + 37 + 36 = 577
- Agent 1's total value: 15 + 56 + 35 + 74 + 66 + 65 + 52 + 8 + 88 = 459

Given that Agent 0 has a higher total valuation, they should receive slightly more value in the allocation to keep the allocation fair.

Next, we can use a round-robin or a greedy approach to allocate the items based on the highest value each agent assigns to the remaining items. This approach will help in reducing the envy as much as possible under these circumstances.

1. Sort items by each agent's valuation:
   - Agent 0: [1 (99), 2 (95), 0 (87), 6 (69), 4 (64), 3 (55), 7 (37), 8 (36), 5 (35)]
   - Agent 1: [8 (88), 3 (74), 4 (66), 5 (65), 1 (56), 6 (52), 2 (35), 0 (15), 7 (8)]

2. Allocate items to maximize fairness:

   Given that Agent 0 has a higher total perceived value, they should get an extra item to balance the perceived values.

   - Agent 0 gets items [1, 2, 0, 7, 5] 
   - Agent 1 gets items [8, 3, 4, 6] 

These allocations aim to balance the total perceived value between the two agents as much as possible while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 0, 7, 5],
    "1": [8, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
