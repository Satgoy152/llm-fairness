Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  13  47  12  30  51  57  67   8
1  66  92  94  14  55  24   6  75  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we should consider the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle. While ensuring envy-freeness in every case might not be possible, we can attempt to achieve a balanced allocation based on their valuations.

Let's first sum up the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 57 + 13 + 47 + 12 + 30 + 51 + 57 + 67 + 8 = 342
- Agent 1: 66 + 92 + 94 + 14 + 55 + 24 + 6 + 75 + 91 = 517

Since Agent 1 has a higher total valuation, we should aim to allocate items in a way that balances the perceived value for both agents.

One effective strategy is to use the "adjusted winner" procedure or a similar heuristic, but due to complexity, let's proceed with a simpler approach of maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

1. Assign items to agents based on their individual preferences, ensuring both receive approximately equal total valuations.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Assign items 0, 5, 6, and 8 to Agent 0.
  - This gives Agent 0 a total valuation of: 57 + 51 + 57 + 8 = 173
- Assign items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 to Agent 1.
  - This gives Agent 1 a total valuation of: 92 + 94 + 14 + 55 + 75 = 330

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations by giving Agent 0 items that they value highly relative to Agent 1's valuations, and vice versa.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
