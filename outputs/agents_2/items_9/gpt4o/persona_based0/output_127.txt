Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6   7   8
0  85   1  54  91  46  13  5  43  20
1  85  65   7  66  21  90  0  79  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85  1 54 91 46 13  5 43 20]
 [85 65  7 66 21 90  0 79 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items between two agents, we need to take into consideration each agent's valuation of the items. One approach is to try to make the allocation envy-free, meaning that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Below is the table with the valuations of items for each agent:

```
Agent 0: [85, 1, 54, 91, 46, 13, 5, 43, 20]
Agent 1: [85, 65, 7, 66, 21, 90, 0, 79, 32]
```

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can employ the following strategy:

1. Each agent will initially bid for their most valued items.
2. We will allocate each item to the agent who values it more, where possible.
3. If both agents value an item equally, we will allocate the item to one of the agents and adjust the overall fairness by considering other items.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Both agents value it at 85. We can give this item to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it more (65 vs. 1). Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it more (54 vs. 7). Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it more (91 vs. 66). Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it more (46 vs. 21). Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it more (90 vs. 13). Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it more (5 vs. 0). Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it more (79 vs. 43). Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it more (32 vs. 20). Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocations. Agent 0 has 5 items and Agent 1 has 4 items, which ensures that all 9 items are allocated. 

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
