Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  96  37  18  99  42  40  49   4
1  24  42  13  22  76  97  52  25  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items to agents while aiming for an envy-free distribution, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize the satisfaction of each agent and ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Here are the valuations of the agents for each item:

- Agent 0: [76, 96, 37, 18, 99, 42, 40, 49, 4]
- Agent 1: [24, 42, 13, 22, 76, 97, 52, 25, 17]

A common approach is to use the "Adjusted Winner Procedure" or "Envy-Free" algorithms, but given the simplicity of having just two agents and a small number of items, we can manually optimize the allocations for fairness by maximizing each agent's total value from their allocated items.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by allocating items with the highest differential in preference where one agent values an item significantly more than the other. This helps maximize the satisfaction of both agents from the start.
   
2. Continue by alternating allocations between agents to ensure an even distribution of numbers of items.

After considering the valuations, here's a fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 5, 6

This results in the following total valuations:
- Agent 0: 76 (item 0) + 96 (item 1) + 99 (item 4) + 49 (item 7) + 4 (item 8) = 324
- Agent 1: 13 (item 2) + 22 (item 3) + 97 (item 5) + 52 (item 6) = 184

By maximizing the high-value preferences of each agent and ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item they highly value, we aim for a fair and envy-free allocation.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
