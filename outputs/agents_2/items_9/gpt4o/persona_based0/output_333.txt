Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  96  56  22   7  97  13  35  41
1  61  99  88   9  15  16  82  52  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 99 88  9 15 16 82 52 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items between the 2 agents such that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize fairness by ensuring that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the allocation of the other agent.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would assign to all items:

- Agent 0: 95 + 96 + 56 + 22 + 7 + 97 + 13 + 35 + 41 = 462
- Agent 1: 61 + 99 + 88 + 9 + 15 + 16 + 82 + 52 + 61 = 483

Next, we aim to divide the items in such a way that both agents feel they are getting a fair share according to their valuations.

One strategy is to prioritize items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents and allocate them to the agent who values them more. We will also ensure each agent receives at least 4 items, as there are 9 items in total, and ensure that the total number of items allocated is 9.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Compare the valuations for each item:

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 values it at 61. (Difference = 34)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 values it at 99. (Difference = -3)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 values it at 88. (Difference = -32)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 9. (Difference = 13)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 7, Agent 1 values it at 15. (Difference = -8)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 values it at 16. (Difference = 81)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 values it at 82. (Difference = -69)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 values it at 52. (Difference = -17)
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 values it at 61. (Difference = -20)

2. Allocate items to maximize each agent's perceived value:

   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0 (highest positive difference).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest positive difference).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (positive difference).

   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (negative difference but low absolute value).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (high negative difference, Agent 1 values it much more).
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1 (high negative difference, Agent 1 values it much more).

   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 (negative difference but low absolute value).
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 1 (negative difference but moderate absolute value).

   We have allocated 8 items so far. We will now allocate the remaining item (Item 8) to balance the count of items or ensure that the total valuation is as balanced as possible.

   - Allocate Item 8 to Agent 0 (balances total item count).

3. Check the allocations:

   - Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 5, 8]
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]

Each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
