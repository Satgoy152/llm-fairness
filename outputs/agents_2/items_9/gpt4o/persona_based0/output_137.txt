Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  74  77  90  33  30  60  97  68
1   0   8  34  81  11  97  99  36  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free between the two agents, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is maximized relative to the other agent's allocation. Envy-freeness in this context means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent based on their valuation.

Let's evaluate the total valuations of both agents for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation of all items is:  
  66 + 74 + 77 + 90 + 33 + 30 + 60 + 97 + 68 = 595

- Agent 1's total valuation of all items is:  
  0 + 8 + 34 + 81 + 11 + 97 + 99 + 36 + 58 = 424

Given these valuations, we want to make sure each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their individual satisfaction. Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Identify Items with High Disparity**: Allocate items that have a large discrepancy in valuation to the agent that values them most. This will help in reducing potential envy.

2. **Balance the Allocation**: Ensure that each agent's perceived value of their own allocation is as balanced as possible, given their total valuation.

### Item Allocation Strategy:

1. Agent 0 should receive items that they value significantly higher than Agent 1.
2. Agent 1 should receive items that they value higher than Agent 0.
3. For items valued similarly by both agents, allocate based on remaining needs to balance total perceived value.

Let's allocate:

- **Items for Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: Valued 66 by Agent 0, and 0 by Agent 1.
  - Item 1: Valued 74 by Agent 0, and 8 by Agent 1.
  - Item 3: Valued 90 by Agent 0, and 81 by Agent 1.
  - Item 4: Valued 33 by Agent 0, and 11 by Agent 1.
  - Item 7: Valued 97 by Agent 0, and 36 by Agent 1.

- **Items for Agent 1**:
  - Item 2: Valued 77 by Agent 0, and 34 by Agent 1.
  - Item 5: Valued 30 by Agent 0, and 97 by Agent 1.
  - Item 6: Valued 60 by Agent 0, and 99 by Agent 1.
  - Item 8: Valued 68 by Agent 0, and 58 by Agent 1.

### Calculated Allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1, 3, 4, 7] with a total valuation of:
  - 66 + 74 + 90 + 33 + 97 = 360

- Agent 1 receives items [2, 5, 6, 8] with a total valuation of:
  - 34 + 97 + 99 + 58 = 288

This allocation balances the perceived value for each agent as much as possible given their individual valuations, and ensures envy-freeness.

### Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
