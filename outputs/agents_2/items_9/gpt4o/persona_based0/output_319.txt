Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  46  19  49  22   1  67  98  60
1  35  83  20  47  52  95  36  44  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 83 20 47 52 95 36 44 27]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we need to ensure that both agents have no envy. This means each agent should perceive their allocation as at least as valuable as the allocation of the other agent.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items combined:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 87 + 46 + 19 + 49 + 22 + 1 + 67 + 98 + 60 = 449
- Agent 1's total valuation: 35 + 83 + 20 + 47 + 52 + 95 + 36 + 44 + 27 = 439

Next, let's attempt to allocate the items such that the perceived values are as equal as possible. 

### Allocation Strategy:
1. We will use a greedy algorithm approach, where we iteratively assign the item that maximizes the difference in value between the two agents to the agent who values it more.
2. We will continue this process until all items are allocated.

### Begin Allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 values it at 35. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 46, Agent 1 values it at 83. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 values it at 20. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 values it at 47. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 52. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 1, Agent 1 values it at 95. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 67, Agent 1 values it at 36. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 values it at 44. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 values it at 27. Assign to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 4, 5

### Valuation Check:

- Agent 0's total value from allocated items: 87 + 49 + 67 + 98 + 60 = 361
- Agent 1's total value from allocated items: 83 + 20 + 52 + 95 = 250

Although not perfectly envy-free, the allocation ensures that both agents get a set of items they highly value, and the allocation respects the integer constraint for item distribution.

### Final JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
