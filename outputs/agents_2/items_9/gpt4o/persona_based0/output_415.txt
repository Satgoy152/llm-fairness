Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  62  40   3  88  63  77   4  11
1  51  46   0  79  97   4  65  72  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness or as close to it as possible. We want each agent to feel that they received at least as much value as the other agent, based on their individual valuations of the items.

Let's look at the total valuation each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 33 + 62 + 40 + 3 + 88 + 63 + 77 + 4 + 11 = 381
- Agent 1's total valuation: 51 + 46 + 0 + 79 + 97 + 4 + 65 + 72 + 84 = 498

The total valuation for all items combined is 381 + 498 = 879.

Next, we will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations. A simple method to achieve this is by iteratively assigning items to the agent who values them most until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the item-by-item allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (51 vs. 33), so allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (62 vs. 46), so allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (40 vs. 0), so allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (79 vs. 3), so allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (97 vs. 88), so allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (63 vs. 4), so allocate to Agent 0.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (77 vs. 65), so allocate to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it more (72 vs. 4), so allocate to Agent 1.
9. Item 8: Agent 1 values it more (84 vs. 11), so allocate to Agent 1.

After this allocation, let's verify each agent's total allocated valuation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 5, 6] with total valuation = 62 + 40 + 63 + 77 = 242
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3, 4, 7, 8] with total valuation = 51 + 79 + 97 + 72 + 84 = 288

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent has a substantial share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
