Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  52  99  82  14  90  49  36  36
1  56  73  40  83  42  26  48  84  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90 52 99 82 14 90 49 36 36]
 [56 73 40 83 42 26 48 84 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer to have the allocation of the other agent, given their own valuation of the items.

Given the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Items: [90, 52, 99, 82, 14, 90, 49, 36, 36]

Agent 1:
- Items: [56, 73, 40, 83, 42, 26, 48, 84, 28]

Let's proceed to allocate the items:

1. High-value items for each agent:
   - Agent 0 highly values items 2 (99), 0 (90), and 5 (90).
   - Agent 1 highly values items 7 (84), 3 (83), and 1 (73).

2. Initial allocation based on highest individual valuations:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 99).
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 84).

3. Next highest valuation:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 90).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 83).

4. Continue with the next highest values:
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 90).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 73).

5. Allocating remaining items:
   - Remaining items: 4, 6, 8
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 14, item 6 at 49, item 8 at 36.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 42, item 6 at 48, item 8 at 28.

   Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 48), as it provides a higher total value for Agent 1.

   Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 14).

   Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (value 36).

This allocation should provide a balance that respects each agent's preferences as much as possible, given the constraint of integer allocations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to minimize envy between the agents by prioritizing their highest valuations.
