Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  90  17  33  37  94  15  66  91
1  62  66  80  58   3  13  81  21  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent places on the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received their fair share according to their own valuations.

Here is a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
   - Agent 0's total value = 44 + 90 + 17 + 33 + 37 + 94 + 15 + 66 + 91 = 487
   - Agent 1's total value = 62 + 66 + 80 + 58 + 3 + 13 + 81 + 21 + 11 = 395

2. **Proportional Fair Share**: Ideally, each agent should receive items worth (in their own valuation) at least half of the total value they assign to all items since there are 2 agents.
   - Agent 0's fair share = 487 / 2 = 243.5
   - Agent 1's fair share = 395 / 2 = 197.5

3. **Item Allocation**: Start allocating items to agents based on their individual highest valuations while keeping track of their total received value and aiming for each to reach or exceed their fair share.

4. **Allocation Strategy**: Prioritize items based on the difference in valuations between agents. Assign items to the agent who values them significantly more or who needs them to reach their fair share.

Using this strategy, here is a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 5, 8, 0]
  - Value to agent 0 = 90 + 94 + 91 + 44 = 319

- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 3, 6, 7, 4]
  - Value to agent 1 = 80 + 58 + 81 + 21 + 3 = 243

With these allocations, both agents surpass their proportional fair share values:

- Agent 0: 319 (more than 243.5)
- Agent 1: 243 (more than 197.5)

This allocation should ensure that both agents are reasonably satisfied with their allocations, as each receives at least their fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 8, 0],
    "1": [2, 3, 6, 7, 4]
}
```
