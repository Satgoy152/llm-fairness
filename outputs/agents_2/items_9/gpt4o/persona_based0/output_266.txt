Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  10  32  38  10  53  49   7  87
1  22  85  61  81  33  42   2  56  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, which means that each agent should not prefer the allocation of items of the other agent over their own. However, with only two agents, we can also consider maximizing the total value each agent perceives from their allocated items.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 93 + 10 + 32 + 38 + 10 + 53 + 49 + 7 + 87 = 379
- Agent 1's total valuation: 22 + 85 + 61 + 81 + 33 + 42 + 2 + 56 + 15 = 397

Next, we will try to allocate the items in a way that each agent's total perceived value is as close to half of their total valuation as possible:

1. Sort the items by the difference in valuations between the two agents:

| Item | Agent 0's Valuation | Agent 1's Valuation | Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| 0    | 93                  | 22                  | 71                             |
| 3    | 38                  | 81                  | -43                            |
| 8    | 87                  | 15                  | 72                             |
| 1    | 10                  | 85                  | -75                            |
| 5    | 53                  | 42                  | 11                             |
| 2    | 32                  | 61                  | -29                            |
| 7    | 7                   | 56                  | -49                            |
| 4    | 10                  | 33                  | -23                            |
| 6    | 49                  | 2                   | 47                             |

2. Allocate items to balance perceived values:

- Allocate items 0, 5, 6, and 8 to Agent 0.
- Allocate items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 to Agent 1.

The allocations maximize the perceived value for each agent while maintaining fairness:

- Agent 0's total valuation of allocated items: 93 + 53 + 49 + 87 = 282
- Agent 1's total valuation of allocated items: 85 + 61 + 81 + 33 + 56 = 316

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation is fair in terms of envy-freeness and attempts to balance the perceived values from each agent's perspective.
