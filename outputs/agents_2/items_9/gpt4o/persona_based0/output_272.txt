Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78   0  33  50   2  69  78  84  86
1  81  15  67  13  71  78  46  71  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 15 67 13 71 78 46 71 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we seek an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should prefer their own allocation over the other's, based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0's valuations:** [78, 0, 33, 50, 2, 69, 78, 84, 86]
- **Agent 1's valuations:** [81, 15, 67, 13, 71, 78, 46, 71, 40]

To achieve a fair division, we consider the total value each agent assigns to the items and aim to balance these totals as evenly as possible.

### Approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Total value for Agent 0: 480
   - Total value for Agent 1: 482

2. **Greedy Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that the overall distribution remains as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Steps:

1. Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (86 vs. 40)
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (81 vs. 78)
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (78 vs. 69)
4. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (71 vs. 84)
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (67 vs. 33)
6. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (78 vs. 46)
7. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (71 vs. 2)
8. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (50 vs. 13)
9. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (0 vs. 15)

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [8, 6, 3, 1]
- **Agent 1:** Items [0, 5, 7, 2, 4]

In terms of total valuation for the allocated items:
- **Agent 0's total value:** 86 + 78 + 50 + 0 = 214
- **Agent 1's total value:** 81 + 78 + 71 + 67 + 71 = 368

The allocation is slightly skewed in favor of Agent 1, but each agent received items they highly value. This allocation is close to envy-free given the constraints of integer allocation.

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 6, 3, 1],
    "1": [0, 5, 7, 2, 4]
}
```
