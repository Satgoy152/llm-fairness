Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  82  23  77  36  73  29   7  95
1  88   7  70  76  38  86  21  36   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's preferences and try to ensure that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation according to their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [76, 82, 23, 77, 36, 73, 29, 7, 95]
Agent 1: [88, 7, 70, 76, 38, 86, 21, 36, 1]
```

Let's use a strategy to allocate the items such that the sum of values for each agent is balanced and, if possible, each agent prefers their own allocation over the other's. Here is one allocation strategy:

1. Assign the most valuable item (according to each agent's valuation) to each agent first to ensure they each receive items they highly value.
2. Balance the remaining items to minimize envy and maximize the perceived value for each agent.

Based on this approach:

- Agent 0 highly values item 8 (value 95).
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (value 88).

Now, distribute the other items to keep the allocations fair:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 82) and item 2 to Agent 1 (value 70).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 86) and item 3 to Agent 0 (value 77).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value 29) and item 4 to Agent 1 (value 38).
- Finally, allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (value 7).

This distribution attempts to balance the total value each agent receives according to their valuations.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives both agents a distribution of items that reflects their preferences and attempts to maintain fairness and minimize envy.
