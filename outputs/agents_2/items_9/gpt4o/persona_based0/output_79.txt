Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  34  36  67  93  77  72  30   5
1  66  60  33   6  29  16  48  44  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value from their allocated items. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total value for each agent if they receive each item individually:

- Agent 0's valuations: [49, 34, 36, 67, 93, 77, 72, 30, 5]
- Agent 1's valuations: [66, 60, 33, 6, 29, 16, 48, 44, 98]

Next, we'll try to allocate items such that the total value of items for each agent is as balanced as possible while ensuring all 9 items are allocated.

We'll start by considering the highest-valued items for each agent:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (93), followed by item 3 (67), item 5 (77), and so on.
2. Agent 1 values item 8 the highest (98), followed by item 0 (66), item 1 (60), and so on.

By alternating the assignment based on each agent's highest remaining value item, we can attempt to balance the distribution:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 and item 8 to Agent 1.
2. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 and item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 and item 1 to Agent 1.
4. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 and item 7 to Agent 1.
5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (last remaining item).

Now, let's check the total values:

- Agent 0 receives items: [4, 5, 3, 6, 2]
  - Total value for Agent 0 = 93 + 77 + 67 + 72 + 36 = 345

- Agent 1 receives items: [8, 0, 1, 7]
  - Total value for Agent 1 = 98 + 66 + 60 + 44 = 268

These allocations ensure that each agent receives a fair share of their valued items, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 3, 6, 2],
    "1": [8, 0, 1, 7]
}
```
