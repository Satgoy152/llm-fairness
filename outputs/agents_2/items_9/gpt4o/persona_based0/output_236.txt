Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  75  25  51  12   4  33  60  69
1  64  83  62  30  34  46  65  37  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we want to consider each agent's valuations and try to make sure each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuation.

We have the following valuations:

Agent 0:  
- Item 0: 58
- Item 1: 75
- Item 2: 25
- Item 3: 51
- Item 4: 12
- Item 5: 4
- Item 6: 33
- Item 7: 60
- Item 8: 69

Agent 1:  
- Item 0: 64
- Item 1: 83
- Item 2: 62
- Item 3: 30
- Item 4: 34
- Item 5: 46
- Item 6: 65
- Item 7: 37
- Item 8: 11

We will attempt to distribute the items such that both agents have an approximately equal total valuation of their allocated items, minimizing envy.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **High Valuation Items:** Start by identifying items highly valued by each agent and try to allocate those to the respective agents.
2. **Balancing Total Valuation:** Adjust the allocation so that the total valuation each agent receives is as equal as possible.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0:**  
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 2: 25
  - Item 3: 51
  - Item 8: 69

- **Agent 1:**  
  - Item 1: 83
  - Item 4: 34
  - Item 5: 46
  - Item 6: 65
  - Item 7: 37

### Valuation Totals:
- **Agent 0 Total Valuation:** 58 + 25 + 51 + 69 = 203
- **Agent 1 Total Valuation:** 83 + 34 + 46 + 65 + 37 = 265

This allocation balances the number of items (4 for Agent 0 and 5 for Agent 1) while trying to account for agent preferences and achieving a fair distribution of total valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
