Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  80  91   1  19  79  77  61  57
1  36  12  42  18  60   6  48  30  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [36 12 42 18 60  6 48 30 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents, we aim to achieve a division that ensures envy-freeness or at least minimizes envy. One approach is to use the method of maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive under these constraints.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 68 + 80 + 91 + 1 + 19 + 79 + 77 + 61 + 57 = 533
- Agent 1's total valuation: 36 + 12 + 42 + 18 + 60 + 6 + 48 + 30 + 90 = 342

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 has a higher total valuation, we initially allocate items that contribute the most to their valuation.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items that maximize their valuation without causing significant envy.

### Allocation Process
After examining the valuations, we can allocate as follows to balance the valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items with relatively higher values according to their valuation.
  - Items: 0 (68), 1 (80), 2 (91), 5 (79), 6 (77)
  - Total Valuation: 68 + 80 + 91 + 79 + 77 = 395

- **Agent 1**: Allocate remaining items to maximize their satisfaction.
  - Items: 3 (18), 4 (60), 7 (30), 8 (90)
  - Total Valuation: 18 + 60 + 30 + 90 = 198

### Final Allocations
Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that both agents receive the maximum possible value according to their preferences, while distributing all 9 items.
