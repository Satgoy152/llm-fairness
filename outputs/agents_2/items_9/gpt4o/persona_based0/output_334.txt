Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  40  39  34  26  61  22  74  42
1  18  57  34   8   7   8   4  96  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the “Adjusted Winner” procedure or other fair division algorithms. However, given the simplicity of this problem with only two agents, a straightforward approach can satisfy fairness criteria. Here, we'll aim to make each agent as happy as possible with their share, given their valuations.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 7 + 40 + 39 + 34 + 26 + 61 + 22 + 74 + 42 = 345
   - Agent 1: 18 + 57 + 34 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 4 + 96 + 60 = 292

2. **Allocate Items One by One Based on Highest Marginal Valuation:**
   - We go through each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it more (18 vs 7), so Agent 1 gets Item 0.
   - **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it more (57 vs 40), so Agent 1 gets Item 1.
   - **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it more (39 vs 34), so Agent 0 gets Item 2.
   - **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it more (34 vs 8), so Agent 0 gets Item 3.
   - **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it more (26 vs 7), so Agent 0 gets Item 4.
   - **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it more (61 vs 8), so Agent 0 gets Item 5.
   - **Item 6:** Agent 0 values it more (22 vs 4), so Agent 0 gets Item 6.
   - **Item 7:** Agent 1 values it more (96 vs 74), so Agent 1 gets Item 7.
   - **Item 8:** Agent 1 values it more (60 vs 42), so Agent 1 gets Item 8.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
   - Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 7, 8

### Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 7, 8]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives the items they value highly, and the total number of items is evenly distributed between the two agents, ensuring fairness.
