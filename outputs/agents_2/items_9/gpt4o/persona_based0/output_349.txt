Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  97  94  28  37  32  11  91  86
1  10  56  22  87  64  91  67  24  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to consider both their valuations and ensure that each agent feels that they have received a fair share of the total value of items. We will use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

First, let's look at the total valuation of items for each agent:

- Agent 0: \(47 + 97 + 94 + 28 + 37 + 32 + 11 + 91 + 86 = 523\)
- Agent 1: \(10 + 56 + 22 + 87 + 64 + 91 + 67 + 24 + 28 = 449\)

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels that they have received at least half of the total value based on their own valuations.

We can start by identifying items that are highly valued by each agent and try to balance the allocations according to their preferences. Since agent 0 has a higher total valuation, we will allocate slightly more items to agent 1 to balance the perceived values.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Assign items with the highest individual valuations to each agent.
2. Balance the remaining items to ensure each agent feels they have a fair share.

After analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 highly values items: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Agent 1 highly values items: 3, 5

Let's allocate the items:

- Assign items 1, 2, 7, 8 to Agent 0, as they have high valuations for these items.
- Assign items 3, 5 to Agent 1, as they highly value these items.

Now, distribute the remaining items to balance the perceived value:

- Agent 0: Already has items 1, 2, 7, 8, total valuation = 97 + 94 + 91 + 86 = 368
- Agent 1: Already has items 3, 5, total valuation = 87 + 91 = 178

Remaining items: 0, 4, 6

Allocate:

- Item 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 10, whereas Agent 0 values it at 47)
- Item 4 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 64, whereas Agent 0 values it at 37)
- Item 6 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 67, whereas Agent 0 values it at 11)

This results in:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 7, 8
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 4, 5, 6

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
