Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95   2  66  38  30  82  48  57  70
1  23  17  49   0  81  22  42  71  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their bundle as at least as valuable as the other agent's bundle according to their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 95 + 2 + 66 + 38 + 30 + 82 + 48 + 57 + 70 = 488
- Agent 1's total valuation: 23 + 17 + 49 + 0 + 81 + 22 + 42 + 71 + 28 = 333

To achieve a fair division, we should try to allocate items such that the total perceived value for each agent is roughly equal. However, given the constraints, we may not achieve perfect equality, but we will seek to minimize envy.

Considering the valuations, let's attempt the following allocation:

1. Allocate high-value items to each agent such that they are satisfied with their bundle.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items with high value for Agent 0 and lower value for Agent 1: [0, 2, 5, 8]
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 95 (item 0) + 66 (item 2) + 82 (item 5) + 70 (item 8) = 313

- **Agent 1**: Remaining items that provide reasonable value: [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 17 (item 1) + 0 (item 3) + 81 (item 4) + 42 (item 6) + 71 (item 7) = 211

The allocation is not perfectly envy-free, but it provides each agent with a substantial portion of their most valued items while ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]
}
``` 

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives a significant portion of their high-value items.
