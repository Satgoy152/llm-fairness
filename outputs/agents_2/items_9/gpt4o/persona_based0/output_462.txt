Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  68  26  47  91  16  59  42  93
1  43  98  87  56  19  29  24   3  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents with the goal of minimizing envy, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value from the items they receive while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Sum the valuations for each agent.
   - Agent 0: 35 + 68 + 26 + 47 + 91 + 16 + 59 + 42 + 93 = 477
   - Agent 1: 43 + 98 + 87 + 56 + 19 + 29 + 24 + 3 + 73 = 432

2. **Initial Allocation by Maximizing Individual Item Values:**
   - We want to allocate items so that each agent has a similar total value.

3. **Allocate Items Greedily to Maximize Fairness:**
   - Assign items to agents by comparing the value each agent places on an item and attempting to equalize total values.

Following this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items that maximize their total value without significantly disadvantaging the other agent.
- Agent 1 receives items that maximize their total value while maintaining overall balance.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Allocate items [1, 4, 5, 7, 8] to Agent 0
   - Allocate items [0, 2, 3, 6] to Agent 1

This results in fairly balanced total values for both agents:

- Agent 0: 68 + 91 + 16 + 42 + 93 = 310
- Agent 1: 35 + 26 + 47 + 59 = 167

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
