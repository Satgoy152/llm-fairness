Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  94  99  79  66  11  83  33  11
1  53  69  88  15  97  22   4  43  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation where neither agent envies the other, based on their valuations. The concept of envy-freeness implies that each agent should value their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent.

To achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Attempt to partition the items such that each agent's allocated bundle has a total valuation close to half of their total valuation of all items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 4 + 94 + 99 + 79 + 66 + 11 + 83 + 33 + 11 = 480
- Agent 1: 53 + 69 + 88 + 15 + 97 + 22 + 4 + 43 + 78 = 469

Next, let's try to allocate items so that each agent gets a total value close to half of their total valuation:

1. Agent 0's half value: 480 / 2 = 240
2. Agent 1's half value: 469 / 2 = 234.5

Let's allocate items:

- Allocate to Agent 0:
  - Item 2 (99)
  - Item 1 (94)
  - Item 6 (83)
  - Total for Agent 0: 99 + 94 + 83 = 276

- Allocate to Agent 1:
  - Item 4 (97)
  - Item 8 (78)
  - Item 0 (53)
  - Item 3 (15)
  - Item 5 (22)
  - Total for Agent 1: 97 + 78 + 53 + 15 + 22 = 265

Now, let's ensure that all items are allocated:

Agent 0 gets items [2, 1, 6]
Agent 1 gets items [4, 8, 0, 3, 5]

This allocation gives each agent a set of items that together maximize their valuations while maintaining a balance between the total values each agent receives.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 6],
    "1": [4, 8, 0, 3, 5]
}
```
