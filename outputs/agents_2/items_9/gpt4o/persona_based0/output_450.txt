Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6  7   8
0  55   2  76  24  87  91  47  8  75
1  32  87  29  22  76   6  45  1  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as the other agent's allocation.

Let's begin by calculating the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 55 + 2 + 76 + 24 + 87 + 91 + 47 + 8 + 75 = 465
- Agent 1's total valuation: 32 + 87 + 29 + 22 + 76 + 6 + 45 + 1 + 90 = 388

Now, we aim to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair portion of the total value.

One method to achieve this is by applying the "divide and choose" strategy, where one agent divides the items into what they perceive as fair bundles, and the other agent chooses the bundle they prefer. However, given the computational nature of this problem, we will use a heuristic approach to ensure both agents receive a fair share of their perceived total value.

### Initial Allocation Strategy:

1. **High-Value Items**: Each agent has items they value significantly. We should try to allocate these high-value items to the respective agents.
2. **Balance the Total Value**: Ensure the total value of items for each agent is as close as possible to their total valuation.

Let's allocate items:

1. **Agent 0** prefers items with valuations: 91 (item 5), 87 (item 4), 76 (item 2), 75 (item 8).
2. **Agent 1** prefers items with valuations: 90 (item 8), 87 (item 1), 76 (item 4).

### Allocation:

Allocate based on high valuations and ensuring fairness:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 5 (value 91)
  - Item 4 (value 87)
  - Item 0 (value 55)
  - Item 2 (value 76)
  - Item 7 (value 8)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 1 (value 87)
  - Item 8 (value 90)
  - Item 3 (value 22)
  - Item 6 (value 45)

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair portion of their perceived value, thereby aiming for envy-freeness.
