Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  71  76   2  13  46   9  22  87
1  21  93  95  16   8  31  76  50   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that each agent should prefer their own allocation of items over the allocation of the other agent.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and the average value per item for each agent:

Agent 0's total valuation: \(77 + 71 + 76 + 2 + 13 + 46 + 9 + 22 + 87 = 403\)
Agent 1's total valuation: \(21 + 93 + 95 + 16 + 8 + 31 + 76 + 50 + 9 = 399\)

Next, we will attempt to allocate the items to minimize envy by considering the preferences of both agents. Our goal is to make each agent's allocation preferable to what they would receive if they swapped allocations with the other agent.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Prefers items with higher personal valuations.
   - Prioritizing: 0 (77), 1 (71), 2 (76), 8 (87).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Also prefers items with higher personal valuations.
   - Prioritizing: 2 (95), 1 (93), 7 (50), 6 (76).

Given this, let's proceed with an allocation:

- Agent 0 will receive: Items 0 (77), 1 (71), 8 (87), 3 (2), 4 (13).
- Agent 1 will receive: Items 2 (95), 5 (31), 6 (76), 7 (50).

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of \(77 + 71 + 87 + 2 + 13 = 250\).
Agent 1 receives a total value of \(95 + 31 + 76 + 50 = 252\).

This is a reasonably fair distribution based on their valuations. Now let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 8],
    "1": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and both agents receive a comparable total value based on their personal valuations.
