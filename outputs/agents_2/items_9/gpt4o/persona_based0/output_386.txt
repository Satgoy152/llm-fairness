Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  73  93   0  57  77  10  81  19
1  50  39  19  74  94   6  69  73  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90 73 93  0 57 77 10 81 19]
 [50 39 19 74 94  6 69 73 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items between the two agents (0 and 1), we'll aim to consider both the total value each agent places on the items they receive and the number of items each agent receives. Here, we aim to achieve an allocation that prevents envy, meaning neither agent should wish to trade their allocation with the other based on their valuations.

### Valuations:

- **Agent 0:** Values for items: [90, 73, 93, 0, 57, 77, 10, 81, 19]
- **Agent 1:** Values for items: [50, 39, 19, 74, 94, 6, 69, 73, 54]

### Total Valuations:

- **Agent 0 Total Value for All Items:** 500
- **Agent 1 Total Value for All Items:** 478

We will look for an allocation that maximizes each agent's perceived fairness based on their valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:

To achieve a fair allocation, we prioritize giving items with higher valuations to each agent while ensuring that the sum of values for each agent is as balanced as possible. This involves:

1. Analyzing the highest values for each agent and allocating those items accordingly.
2. Ensuring each agent receives approximately equal total value.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (93), Item 0 (90), Item 7 (81)
   - Additional items to balance: Item 1 (73), Item 5 (77)
   - Total items: 5 (0, 1, 2, 5, 7)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (94), Item 3 (74)
   - Additional items to balance: Item 6 (69), Item 8 (54)
   - Total items: 4 (3, 4, 6, 8)

### Total Value After Allocation:

- **Agent 0 Total Value:** 414 (90 + 73 + 93 + 77 + 81)
- **Agent 1 Total Value:** 384 (74 + 94 + 69 + 54)

The allocation provides both agents with a relatively balanced total value based on their preferences, reducing the likelihood of envy.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 8]
}
```
