Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39   8  55  44  48  11  55   6  15
1   8  87  86  43   0  47  62  71  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item. A common approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels that they have received at least as much value as the other agent according to their own valuations. We can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while attempting to balance the distribution of items.

Let's start by examining the total valuation of each agent:

- Agent 0 values: [39, 8, 55, 44, 48, 11, 55, 6, 15]
- Agent 1 values: [8, 87, 86, 43, 0, 47, 62, 71, 65]

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 39 + 8 + 55 + 44 + 48 + 11 + 55 + 6 + 15 = 281
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 8 + 87 + 86 + 43 + 0 + 47 + 62 + 71 + 65 = 469

To achieve a fair division, we will try to allocate items such that each agent's valuation of their allocated items is as close as possible to half of their total valuation or at least feel balanced.

We can use a simple algorithm to achieve this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it more, unless it causes a significant imbalance in the total value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 39 and Agent 1 at 8. Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 8 and Agent 1 at 87. Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 55 and Agent 1 at 86. Assign to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 44 and Agent 1 at 43. Assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 48 and Agent 1 at 0. Assign to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 11 and Agent 1 at 47. Assign to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 55 and Agent 1 at 62. Assign to Agent 1.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 6 and Agent 1 at 71. Assign to Agent 1.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 15 and Agent 1 at 65. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the total allocation values:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 3, 4], total value: 39 + 44 + 48 = 131
- Agent 1 receives items: [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8], total value: 87 + 86 + 47 + 62 + 71 + 65 = 418

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, with Agent 1 receiving more due to their overall higher valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
