Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  99  84  76  59  97  33  63   8
1  64  28   1  69  81  79  94  60  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to each item and try to distribute the items so that no agent envies another agent's allocation. The goal is to make sure each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

The given valuations are:

Agent 0: [52, 99, 84, 76, 59, 97, 33, 63, 8]  
Agent 1: [64, 28, 1, 69, 81, 79, 94, 60, 85]  

Let's start by examining the valuations for each item and determine which agent values each item highest. We can consider giving each item to the agent who values it more, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (64 vs. 52).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (99 vs. 28).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (84 vs. 1).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (69 vs. 76).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (81 vs. 59).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (97 vs. 79).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (94 vs. 33).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it more (63 vs. 60).
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it more (85 vs. 8).

Based on the above analysis, a possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 5, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 4, 6, 8

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items (4 items for Agent 0 and 5 items for Agent 1), and it ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it more, reducing potential envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 6, 8]
}
```
