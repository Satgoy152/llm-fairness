Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52   5  54  50  11  20  38  25  85
1  13  83   2  53  73  31  51  29  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 83  2 53 73 31 51 29 87]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where each agent feels that they have received a bundle of items that is at least as valuable as the bundle received by the other agent, according to their own valuations.

Let's use the following valuations to guide our decision:

| Agent | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0     | 52 | 5  | 54 | 50 | 11 | 20 | 38 | 25 | 85 |
| 1     | 13 | 83 | 2  | 53 | 73 | 31 | 51 | 29 | 87 |

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Maximize each agent's total valuation**: Assign items to maximize the total subjective valuation for each agent.
2. **Ensure envy-freeness**: Ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation by checking if the allocation is Pareto optimal.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

- **Agent 0**: Start by allocating items that Agent 0 values highly compared to Agent 1. These items are 0, 2, 3, 6, and 8.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly compared to Agent 0. These items are 1, 4, 5, and 7.

**Valuation Check:**

- **Agent 0's Total Valuation**: 52 (item 0) + 54 (item 2) + 50 (item 3) + 38 (item 6) + 85 (item 8) = 279
- **Agent 1's Total Valuation**: 83 (item 1) + 73 (item 4) + 31 (item 5) + 29 (item 7) = 216

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their personal valuation and attempts to minimize envy.

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, both agents receive an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. This distribution maximizes the satisfaction of both agents while maintaining fairness based on the given valuations.
