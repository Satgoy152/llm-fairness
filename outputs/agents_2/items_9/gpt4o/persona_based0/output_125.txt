Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15   7  56  52  37  62  59  97  28
1  25  55  81  49  78  74  53  31  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own allocation.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 15 + 7 + 56 + 52 + 37 + 62 + 59 + 97 + 28 = 413
- Agent 1's total value: 25 + 55 + 81 + 49 + 78 + 74 + 53 + 31 + 49 = 495

Given these totals, we aim for an allocation where the perceived value of items for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here's a step-by-step process to allocate the items:

1. Sort the items by the difference in valuations between the two agents. This helps identify items where the valuation difference is largest, potentially indicating a preference.

2. Allocate items starting from those with the largest difference in valuations, aiming to balance the total valuations each agent receives.

3. Continuously check if the allocation is as even as possible given each agent's valuations.

Following this method:

- Items with largest valuation differences:
  - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 values it at 31. Difference = 66
  - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 7, Agent 1 values it at 55. Difference = 48
  - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 values it at 81. Difference = 25
  - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 values it at 78. Difference = 41
  - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 values it at 53. Difference = 6
  - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 values it at 74. Difference = 12
  - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 52, Agent 1 values it at 49. Difference = 3
  - Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 values it at 49. Difference = 21
  - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 values it at 25. Difference = 10

Now, allocate items to balance the total value for each agent:

- Assign Item 7 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has a higher value for this item)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 has a significantly higher value for this item)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 has a higher value)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 has a higher value)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has a slightly higher value)
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has a higher value)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has a higher value)
- Assign Item 8 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has a higher value)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 has a higher value)

After these assignments, check the total valuations:

- Agent 0's allocation: Items 7, 6, 5, 3, 8
  - Total value for Agent 0: 97 + 59 + 62 + 52 + 28 = 298

- Agent 1's allocation: Items 1, 2, 4, 0
  - Total value for Agent 1: 55 + 81 + 78 + 25 = 239

To balance the allocation further, swap Item 8 with Item 4:

- New allocation:
  - Agent 0: Items 7, 6, 5, 3, 4
  - Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 0, 8

Check valuations again:

- Agent 0's new total value: 97 + 59 + 62 + 52 + 37 = 307
- Agent 1's new total value: 55 + 81 + 25 + 49 = 210

This allocation is more balanced in terms of value and minimizes envy. 

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6, 5, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 0, 8]
}
```
