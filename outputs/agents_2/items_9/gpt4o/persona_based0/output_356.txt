Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  25  83  86  35  95  45  85  52
1  48   3  37  72  99  39  39   0  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent values their own bundle at least as much as they value the other agent's bundle.

We have the following valuation matrix:

| Agent | Items 0 | Items 1 | Items 2 | Items 3 | Items 4 | Items 5 | Items 6 | Items 7 | Items 8 |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 0     | 99      | 25      | 83      | 86      | 35      | 95      | 45      | 85      | 52      |
| 1     | 48      | 3       | 37      | 72      | 99      | 39      | 39      | 0       | 85      |

To achieve a fair allocation, we should consider both the sum of values each agent receives and the possibility of envy-free allocation. Let's assess possible allocations:

1. **Initial Approach**: 
   - Consider assigning high-value items to each agent based on their preferences.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign items to agents to balance their total valuations, aiming to make each agent prefer their own bundle over the other's.

### Allocation Steps:

**Agent 0**:
- Assign high-value items: 0 (99), 2 (83), 5 (95).

**Agent 1**:
- Assign high-value items: 4 (99), 3 (72).

Now we need to distribute the remaining items: 1, 6, 7, and 8.

**Balancing Remaining Items**:
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (39).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (85).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (25).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (85).

### Calculated Allocations:

- **Agent 0** gets items [0, 1, 2, 5, 7].
- **Agent 1** gets items [3, 4, 6, 8].

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations each agent receives while considering their preferences, thus approaching an envy-free distribution.
