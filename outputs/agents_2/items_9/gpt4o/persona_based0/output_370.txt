Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3  4   5   6   7   8
0  55  16  69   1  2  27  12  54  25
1  83  56  46  71  8  60  13  66  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between two agents while considering envy-freeness, we usually aim to ensure that each agent believes they have received a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0's total valuation**: 55 + 16 + 69 + 1 + 2 + 27 + 12 + 54 + 25 = 261
- **Agent 1's total valuation**: 83 + 56 + 46 + 71 + 8 + 60 + 13 + 66 + 59 = 462

Next, we calculate what would be an equitable share based on these valuations:

1. **Agent 0's equitable share**: \( \frac{261}{261 + 462} \times 100\% \approx 36.1\% \) of the total value.
2. **Agent 1's equitable share**: \( \frac{462}{261 + 462} \times 100\% \approx 63.9\% \) of the total value.

We can now proceed to allocate the items in such a way that each agent's allocated value adheres to these proportions as closely as possible:

### Allocation Strategy

- **Agent 0**: We try to allocate items to Agent 0 such that the total valuation of these items is close to 36.1% of the combined total valuation.
- **Agent 1**: Similarly, we allocate items to Agent 1 such that the total valuation of these items is close to 63.9% of the combined total valuation.

#### Step-by-Step Allocation

1. **Assign the highest value items to each agent based on their individual valuations:**

   - **Agent 0** values item 2 the highest (69). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest (83). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Continue assigning remaining items trying to balance according to the proportional share:**

   - Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 66 for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 71 for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 60 for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 16 for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 13 for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 2 for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (value 25 for Agent 0).

#### Calculating Final Allocations

- **Agent 0's allocation**: Items [2, 1, 4, 8] with total value = 69 + 16 + 2 + 25 = 112
- **Agent 1's allocation**: Items [0, 7, 3, 5, 6] with total value = 83 + 66 + 71 + 60 + 13 = 293

The allocations approximate the proportional valuations specified by the equitable shares calculated initially.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

{
    "0": [2, 1, 4, 8],
    "1": [0, 7, 3, 5, 6]
}
