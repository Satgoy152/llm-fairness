Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  73  22   6   6  84  83  10  55
1  64  37   8  44  47  45  67  47  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy by considering the valuations of each agent for the items. The goal is to make each agent as satisfied as possible with their allocation based on their perceived value of the items they receive.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 50 + 73 + 22 + 6 + 6 + 84 + 83 + 10 + 55 = 389
- Agent 1 total valuation: 64 + 37 + 8 + 44 + 47 + 45 + 67 + 47 + 62 = 421

Next, we proceed with an allocation strategy that aims to ensure each agent gets items they value highly, while keeping the total valuation between them as balanced as possible.

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest with a valuation of 84.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest with a valuation of 64.

Let's start the allocation by giving each agent the item they value the most:

- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

Now, let's continue allocating based on the next highest valuations that each agent has for the remaining items:

- Agent 0's next highest valuation is item 6 with a value of 83, then item 1 with a value of 73.
- Agent 1's next highest valuation is item 8 with a value of 62, then item 6 with a value of 67.

Allocate:

- Item 6 to Agent 0 (83).
- Item 8 to Agent 1 (62).

Continuing:

- Agent 0's next highest is item 1 (73).
- Agent 1's next highest is item 6, but it's already allocated, so the next is item 7 (47).

Allocate:

- Item 1 to Agent 0 (73).
- Item 7 to Agent 1 (47).

Now we have:

Agent 0: [5, 6, 1]
Agent 1: [0, 8, 7]

Remaining items: 2, 3, 4

Agent 0 values item 2 the highest among the remaining at 22, and Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 47. Let's allocate:

- Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Item 4 to Agent 1.

Remaining items: 3

Let's allocate the remaining item 3 to the agent who would benefit more from it in terms of reducing envy. Agent 1 has a slightly higher overall valuation, so we give item 3 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

Agent 0: [5, 6, 1, 2]
Agent 1: [0, 8, 7, 4, 3]

This ensures a balanced distribution based on their valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 1, 2],
    "1": [0, 8, 7, 4, 3]
}
```
