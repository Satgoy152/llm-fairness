Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  81  65  19  95  49  20  46  55
1  71  51  28  56  52  83  38  43  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we must consider each agent's valuation of the items. One approach to achieve this is to use the method of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This approach helps to distribute the items such that neither agent envies the other, given their individual valuations.

Let's first calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 14 + 81 + 65 + 19 + 95 + 49 + 20 + 46 + 55 = 444
- Agent 1's total valuation: 71 + 51 + 28 + 56 + 52 + 83 + 38 + 43 + 78 = 500

Now, let's proceed with an allocation that tries to balance these valuations:

1. Sort items by value difference between agents to identify which items are most contested.

2. We can then allocate items to maximize each agent's share of their perceived total value while attempting to maintain a roughly equal number of items per agent.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

- Agent 0 highly values item 4 (95) and item 1 (81), so they should receive these items.
- Agent 1 highly values item 5 (83) and item 8 (78), so they should receive these items.

The remaining items can be allocated by checking the next highest values for each agent and alternating allocation to ensure fairness:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (71 for Agent 1 vs. 14 for Agent 0).
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (65 for Agent 0 vs. 28 for Agent 1).
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (56 for Agent 1 vs. 19 for Agent 0).
4. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (38 for Agent 1 vs. 20 for Agent 0).
5. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (46 for Agent 0 vs. 43 for Agent 1).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 4, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 5, 6, 8

This ensures both agents get a fair share based on their valuations and the total number of items is equally distributed.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
