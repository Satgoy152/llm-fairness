Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  57  82  96  96  65  56  71  66
1  36  48  49  21  60  88  36  25  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the other agent values the same allocation, minimizing envy.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 total value: 67 + 57 + 82 + 96 + 96 + 65 + 56 + 71 + 66 = 656
- Agent 1 total value: 36 + 48 + 49 + 21 + 60 + 88 + 36 + 25 + 78 = 441

Next, we need to allocate the items such that the total value each agent gets is approximately equal, considering their respective valuations.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign items to Agent 0 by prioritizing their higher-valued items.
2. Assign the remaining items to Agent 1.

Let's implement this step-by-step:

- Agent 0 highly values items 3, 4, and 2.
- Agent 1 highly values items 5 and 8.

Allocate the items based on these valuations:

1. Give items [3, 4, 2] to Agent 0.
2. Give items [5, 8] to Agent 1.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Items left: 0, 1, 6, 7

- Agent 0's values for these items are: [67, 57, 56, 71]
- Agent 1's values for these items are: [36, 48, 36, 25]

Continue allocating based on maximizing total values:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (48 value for Agent 1 is higher than 57 for Agent 0)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (67 value for Agent 0 is higher than 36 for Agent 1)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (56 value for Agent 0 is higher than 36 for Agent 1)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (71 value for Agent 0 is higher than 25 for Agent 1)

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 5, 8]
}
```
