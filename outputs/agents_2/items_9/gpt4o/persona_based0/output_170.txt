Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61   8  71  58  81  68  60  23  50
1  84  64  13  79   2  68  51  28   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the two agents, we aim to minimize envy, which means each agent should feel that they received a fair share according to their own valuation. We will use the "Envy-Free" criterion as a guide for this allocation, ensuring that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they would value the allocation of the other agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations on items 4, 2, and 5.
   - Agent 1 has high valuations on items 0, 3, and 1.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Allocate items primarily based on the highest individual valuations to reduce potential for envy.

**Step-by-step Allocation**:

- **Step 1**: Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0: 81).
- **Step 2**: Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1: 84).
- **Step 3**: Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0: 71).
- **Step 4**: Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1: 79).
- **Step 5**: Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (third highest value for Agent 1: 64).
- **Step 6**: Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (third highest value for Agent 0: 68).
- **Step 7**: Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0: 60).
- **Step 8**: Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1: 28).
- **Step 9**: Allocate item 8 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0: 50).

**Final Allocation**:
- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 3, 7

This allocation minimizes envy since each agent receives items they highly value.

**JSON Format Allocation**:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and attempts to balance the perceived value for each agent, reducing potential envy.
