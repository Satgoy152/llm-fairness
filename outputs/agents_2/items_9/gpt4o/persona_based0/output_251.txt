Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  26  30  45   7  71  89   1  28
1  76  96  53  52  38  86  73  38  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve a division such that no agent envies the other's allocation. Envy-freeness means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(14 + 26 + 30 + 45 + 7 + 71 + 89 + 1 + 28 = 311\)
- Agent 1: \(76 + 96 + 53 + 52 + 38 + 86 + 73 + 38 + 82 = 594\)

Since Agent 1 values the items more overall, we should aim for Agent 0 to receive items that they value highly relative to Agent 1, and vice versa.

One common method is to use the "divide and choose" principle, but for simplicity and given the constraints, we'll attempt a direct allocation:

**Step 1:** Sort items by the difference in valuation (Agent 0's value - Agent 1's value):

1. Item 7: 1 (Agent 0) - 38 (Agent 1) = -37
2. Item 0: 14 (Agent 0) - 76 (Agent 1) = -62
3. Item 8: 28 (Agent 0) - 82 (Agent 1) = -54
4. Item 4: 7 (Agent 0) - 38 (Agent 1) = -31
5. Item 2: 30 (Agent 0) - 53 (Agent 1) = -23
6. Item 3: 45 (Agent 0) - 52 (Agent 1) = -7
7. Item 5: 71 (Agent 0) - 86 (Agent 1) = -15
8. Item 6: 89 (Agent 0) - 73 (Agent 1) = 16
9. Item 1: 26 (Agent 0) - 96 (Agent 1) = -70

**Step 2:** Allocate items, ensuring each agent's total valuation remains as balanced as possible:

- **Agent 0:** Should get items they relatively value more than Agent 1.
- **Agent 1:** Should get items they relatively value more than Agent 0.

**Allocations:**

- Agent 0 receives items: 6, 3, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8

**Verification:**

- Agent 0's total value: \(89 + 45 + 71 = 205\)
- Agent 1's total value: \(76 + 96 + 53 + 38 + 38 + 82 = 383\)

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives items they highly value, and Agent 1 receives more items but with higher individual valuations, attempting to balance perceived fairness.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
