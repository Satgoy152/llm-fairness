Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  49  48  10  13  99  36  18   4
1  11   8  93  73  95  29  13  36  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, if possible, or at least a fair division based on each agent's preferences. 

We will use the following steps to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 39 + 49 + 48 + 10 + 13 + 99 + 36 + 18 + 4 = 316
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 11 + 8 + 93 + 73 + 95 + 29 + 13 + 36 + 56 = 414

2. **Determine Fair Share**: 
   - Fair share for Agent 0: 316 / 2 = 158
   - Fair share for Agent 1: 414 / 2 = 207

3. **Allocate Items to Approach Fair Share**:
   - We need to allocate items such that each agent gets as close as possible to their fair share, while ensuring envy-freeness. Let's start by allocating the higher valued items according to each agent's preference.

4. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Allocate items based on descending order of value for each agent until we approximate their fair share.

5. **Allocation Process**:
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest, followed by item 2, item 3, etc.
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest, followed by item 1, item 2, etc.

   Let's allocate items based on their values to each agent:
   - Agent 1 gets item 4 (95), item 2 (93), item 3 (73). Total value for Agent 1: 261.
   - Agent 0 gets item 5 (99), item 1 (49), item 0 (39). Total value for Agent 0: 187.

6. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - Remaining items: 6, 7, 8.
   - Based on remaining preferences, allocate item 6 (36) to Agent 0, and items 7 (18) and 8 (56) to Agent 1.

7. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [0, 1, 5, 6]
   - Agent 1: [2, 3, 4, 7, 8]

This allocation ensures both agents receive items that maximize their respective values and approach their fair share, while maintaining a fair distribution.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
