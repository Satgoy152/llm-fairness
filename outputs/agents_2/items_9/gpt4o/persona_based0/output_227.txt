Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  21  12  47  81  21  68  86  68
1  89  87  81  61  37  62  98  69  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[62 21 12 47 81 21 68 86 68]
 [89 87 81 61 37 62 98 69 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent assigns to each item. A potential approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent without causing envy. One common method is to use the Envy-Free Matching approach, aiming to allocate items so that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as the other's.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [62, 21, 12, 47, 81, 21, 68, 86, 68]
Agent 1: [89, 87, 81, 61, 37, 62, 98, 69, 74]
```

We aim to allocate the items such that:

1. Each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their perceived value.
2. The allocation is envy-free, meaning no agent prefers the other's allocation over their own.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0** has a higher valuation for items 4, 7, and 8.
- **Agent 1** has a higher valuation for items 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.

To ensure an envy-free allocation, we can allocate as follows:

- Assign items with the highest valuation differences to the agent who values them more.
  
  Thus, the allocation could be:
  
  - **Agent 0**: Items 4, 7, and 8
  - **Agent 1**: Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6

This allocation gives each agent a bundle they perceive as valuable without causing envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
