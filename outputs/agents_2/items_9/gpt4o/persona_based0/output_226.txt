Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  94  96  97  58  37  95  86  29
1  63  48  91  36  29  97  44  33   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-freeness in allocating the items between the two agents, let's first evaluate the total value each agent places on the items. This approach will help ensure that both agents feel they have received a fair share of the total value.

Agent 0's valuations:
- Total value: 61 + 94 + 96 + 97 + 58 + 37 + 95 + 86 + 29 = 653

Agent 1's valuations:
- Total value: 63 + 48 + 91 + 36 + 29 + 97 + 44 + 33 + 9 = 450

Now, let's allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share of the total value according to their preferences. We aim to keep the allocations envy-free by ensuring each agent receives items they value highly.

1. Allocate to Agent 0:
   - Items 3, 2, 1, 6: These have the highest valuations for Agent 0 (97, 96, 94, and 95 respectively).

2. Allocate to Agent 1:
   - Items 5, 0, 4, 7, 8: These items have relatively high valuations for Agent 1, and the remaining items from Agent 0's allocation complete the item distribution.

Let's verify the allocations:

Agent 0:
- Allocated items: [3, 2, 1, 6]
- Total value: 97 + 96 + 94 + 95 = 382

Agent 1:
- Allocated items: [5, 0, 4, 7, 8]
- Total value: 97 + 63 + 29 + 33 + 9 = 231

Total items allocated: 9, which satisfies the condition of allocating all items.

Finally, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 1, 6],
    "1": [5, 0, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
