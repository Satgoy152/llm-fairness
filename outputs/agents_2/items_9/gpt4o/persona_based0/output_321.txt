Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  59  66  86   7  96   2  14  39
1  91  63   9  96  44  19  31  59  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation between the two agents, we will employ the concept of envy-freeness, aiming to minimize the potential for envy between the two agents. This means each agent should not prefer the allocation of the other over their own.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 56 + 59 + 66 + 86 + 7 + 96 + 2 + 14 + 39 = 425
- Agent 1: 91 + 63 + 9 + 96 + 44 + 19 + 31 + 59 + 98 = 510

Each agent should get approximately half of the total value of all items. However, since the total sum of values is different for each agent, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that feels fair based on their respective valuations.

One possible way to allocate the items is as follows:

1. Assign items with high value to each agent based on their preferences.
2. Ensure that the sum of values for each agent does not deviate significantly from the fair share.

Let's find a feasible allocation:

### Proposed Allocation:
- Assign items primarily valued by Agent 0: Items 5, 3, 2, 0
- Assign items primarily valued by Agent 1: Items 8, 1, 4, 7, 6

Now, let's verify if this allocation is fair based on valuations:

- **Agent 0's allocation:** Items 5, 3, 2, 0
  - Total value: 96 (Item 5) + 86 (Item 3) + 66 (Item 2) + 56 (Item 0) = 304

- **Agent 1's allocation:** Items 8, 1, 4, 7, 6
  - Total value: 98 (Item 8) + 63 (Item 1) + 44 (Item 4) + 59 (Item 7) + 31 (Item 6) = 295

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value for each agent, keeping their preferences in mind.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3, 2, 0],
    "1": [8, 1, 4, 7, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that reflects their valuations, aiming for envy-freeness, and all 9 items are distributed.
