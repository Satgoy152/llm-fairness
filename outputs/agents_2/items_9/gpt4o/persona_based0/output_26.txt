Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  31  86  97  73  15  21  77  49
1  59  66  69   7  52  10  82  78  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy, we'll use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. We'll aim for an allocation that balances the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

**Agent 0's valuations:**  
- Item 0: 94  
- Item 1: 31  
- Item 2: 86  
- Item 3: 97  
- Item 4: 73  
- Item 5: 15  
- Item 6: 21  
- Item 7: 77  
- Item 8: 49  

**Agent 1's valuations:**  
- Item 0: 59  
- Item 1: 66  
- Item 2: 69  
- Item 3: 7  
- Item 4: 52  
- Item 5: 10  
- Item 6: 82  
- Item 7: 78  
- Item 8: 63  

To find a fair allocation, we can consider a strategy that allocates high-value items to each agent based on their preferences, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** values items 3, 0, and 2 highly.
2. **Agent 1** values items 7, 6, and 1 highly.

### Steps:
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value (97) for them.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value (78) for them.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (second-highest, 94).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (second-highest, 82).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (third-highest, 86).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (third-highest, 66).

Now we have 3 items left: 4, 5, and 8. We need to divide these remaining items, considering the balance of value.

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value: 73), as it helps balance the total value between the agents.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (value: 63), which complements their total value.
- Finally, assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value: 15), as it has a lower impact on the overall envy.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** [3, 0, 2, 4, 5]
- **Agent 1:** [7, 6, 1, 8]

This allocation considers both agents' preferences and attempts to balance the total value each receives, reducing potential envy.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [7, 6, 1, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations, with each agent receiving 4 and 5 items respectively, totaling 9 items in all.
