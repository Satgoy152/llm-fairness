Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  71  78  67  87   4  33  22  55
1  68  11  42  85  99  27  77  12  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we aim to allocate items in such a way that each agent values their set of items at least as much as the other agent's set. One approach to this problem is the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or other fair division algorithms, but given the simplicity of this scenario, a manual inspection can also work well.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items combined:

- **Agent 0's total value**: 59 + 71 + 78 + 67 + 87 + 4 + 33 + 22 + 55 = 476
- **Agent 1's total value**: 68 + 11 + 42 + 85 + 99 + 27 + 77 + 12 + 26 = 447

Since Agent 0 values the items slightly more in total, we should try to allocate items such that both agents have similar total valuations for their assigned items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Highest value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (value 87), Item 2 (value 78), Item 1 (value 71)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (value 99), Item 3 (value 85), Item 6 (value 77)

2. **Allocate items based on high preference while balancing total valuation:**

   - **Agent 0:**
     - Items 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 (Values: 59, 71, 78, 87, 22)
     - Total value: 317

   - **Agent 1:**
     - Items 3, 5, 6, 8 (Values: 85, 27, 77, 26)
     - Total value: 320

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations each agent receives while considering their preferences for specific items. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 7],
    "1": [3, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a nearly equal share of the total value they assign to the items, hence maintaining fairness and minimizing envy.
