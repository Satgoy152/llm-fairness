Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  51   1  26  61  92  88  44  29
1  86  64  86   8  57   1  76  77  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to maximize fairness, where each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as the other agent's allocation according to their own valuations.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 1: 51
  - Item 2: 1
  - Item 3: 26
  - Item 4: 61
  - Item 5: 92
  - Item 6: 88
  - Item 7: 44
  - Item 8: 29

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 86
  - Item 1: 64
  - Item 2: 86
  - Item 3: 8
  - Item 4: 57
  - Item 5: 1
  - Item 6: 76
  - Item 7: 77
  - Item 8: 96

To achieve a fair division, we will try to allocate items such that the total value perceived by each agent is as balanced as possible, while ensuring that every item is allocated to one of the agents.

After evaluating the possible allocations, the following allocation provides a fair division:

- Agent 0 receives items: 5, 6, 0, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8

Let's verify:

- Total value for Agent 0: 92 (Item 5) + 88 (Item 6) + 18 (Item 0) + 26 (Item 3) = 224
- Total value for Agent 1: 64 (Item 1) + 86 (Item 2) + 57 (Item 4) + 77 (Item 7) + 96 (Item 8) = 380

This allocation distributes items in a way that attempts to balance the perceived total value for each agent, leaning towards maximizing the total utility.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
