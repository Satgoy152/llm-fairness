Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  44  57  84   4  95  97  40  52
1  16   3  22  24  27  18   2  40  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 44 57 84  4 95 97 40 52]
 [16  3 22 24 27 18  2 40 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to find an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent would prefer the allocation of items given to another agent over their own. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [92, 44, 57, 84, 4, 95, 97, 40, 52]
Agent 1: [16, 3, 22, 24, 27, 18, 2, 40, 14]
```

We'll employ the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or a similar heuristic to achieve a fair division. Let's start by assigning items based on the highest valuation difference between the two agents:

1. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 97, while Agent 1 values it at 2. The difference is 95. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 95, while Agent 1 values it at 18. The difference is 77. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 92, while Agent 1 values it at 16. The difference is 76. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 84, while Agent 1 values it at 24. The difference is 60. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 57, while Agent 1 values it at 22. The difference is 35. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
6. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 52, while Agent 1 values it at 14. The difference is 38. Assign item 8 to Agent 0.
7. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 44, while Agent 1 values it at 3. The difference is 41. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

At this point, Agent 0 has been allocated 7 items. To ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated, we assign the remaining items to Agent 1:

8. **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 1.
9. **Item 7**: Assign to Agent 1.

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total of 7 items and Agent 1 a total of 2 items. Although this allocation is not perfectly envy-free, it respects the integer allocation requirement while considering the valuation differences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [4, 7]
}
```
