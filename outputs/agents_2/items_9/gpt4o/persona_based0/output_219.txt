Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3  4   5   6   7   8
0  87   2  91  27  1  38  25  11  56
1  98  30  37  98  3  52  73  74  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents in a way that is fair and seeks to minimize envy, we should consider each agent's valuation for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations. 

Let's examine the valuations provided and apply a fair division strategy, such as the adjusted winner procedure or a similar heuristic, to allocate items.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**  
   - Agent 0 values items 2 (91), 0 (87), and 5 (38) the most.
   - Agent 1 values items 0 (98), 3 (98), and 6 (73) the most.

2. **Allocate items with clear high preference:**  
   - Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 0 and not highly valued by Agent 1, so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Item 3 is highly valued by Agent 1 and not by Agent 0, so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining high-value items to balance total value:**  
   - Item 0: Both agents value item 0 highly (87 for Agent 0 and 98 for Agent 1). To avoid envy and balance total value, let's give item 0 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it slightly more.
   - Item 6 is highly valued by Agent 1 (73), so allocate it to Agent 1.
   - Item 5 is the next highest for Agent 0, so allocate it to Agent 0.

4. **Allocate remaining items by balancing the total value:**
   - Item 7: Allocate to Agent 1 as it adds value without tipping balance too much.
   - Item 8: Allocate to Agent 0 for similar reasons.
   - Item 1: Allocate to Agent 0, it has a low value for both.
   - Item 4: Allocate to Agent 1, as it has very low value for both but fits the balance.

### Final Allocation:
We aim to balance the total perceived value for each agent while ensuring each item is assigned.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 8, 1],
    "1": [0, 3, 6, 7, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.
