Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  91  48  69  55  83  70  29   0
1  31  45  38  66  64  62  77  47  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve a distribution such that neither agent envies the other's allocation based on their respective valuations. This implies that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as the allocation of the other agent.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 87 + 91 + 48 + 69 + 55 + 83 + 70 + 29 + 0 = 532
- Agent 1: 31 + 45 + 38 + 66 + 64 + 62 + 77 + 47 + 31 = 461

Next, we need to allocate the items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible, while also considering that each agent should prefer their own allocation.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning the most valued items to each agent to ensure they have a strong preference for their allocation.

Agent 0's top valued items:
- Item 1 (91)
- Item 0 (87)
- Item 5 (83)

Agent 1's top valued items:
- Item 6 (77)
- Item 4 (64)
- Item 3 (66)

2. Distribute remaining items to balance the overall value:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 48 for Agent 0, 38 for Agent 1)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 47 for Agent 1, 29 for Agent 0)
- Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (value 31 for Agent 1, 0 for Agent 0)

Now let's check the total valuations after this allocation:

- Agent 0: 91 (Item 1) + 87 (Item 0) + 83 (Item 5) + 48 (Item 2) = 309
- Agent 1: 77 (Item 6) + 66 (Item 3) + 64 (Item 4) + 47 (Item 7) + 31 (Item 8) = 285

This allocation is close to balanced and ensures that each agent has some of their most valued items, reducing potential envy.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 5, 2],
    "1": [6, 3, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
