Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  13  53   8  22  97  89  25  57
1  77  35  53  70  48  87  29  14  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agentâ€™s value from their allocated items. We aim to balance the perceived value each agent receives, making the allocation as fair and envy-free as possible.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **List the Items and Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's valuations: [77, 13, 53, 8, 22, 97, 89, 25, 57]
   - Agent 1's valuations: [77, 35, 53, 70, 48, 87, 29, 14, 42]

2. **Calculate the Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 441
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 455

3. **Rank the Items by Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's ranked items by value: [5, 6, 0, 8, 2, 4, 7, 1, 3]
   - Agent 1's ranked items by value: [0, 5, 3, 4, 2, 1, 8, 6, 7]

4. **Attempt to Assign Items to Maximize Each Agent's Valuation:**
   - We aim to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their valuation.

5. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items to each agent to maximize their satisfaction, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of their high-value items.

Here is the allocation that attempts to balance the values fairly:

- Assign items [5, 7, 8, 3] to Agent 0.
- Assign items [0, 1, 2, 4, 6] to Agent 1.

This allocation considers each agent's valuation preferences and attempts to distribute the items such that each agent receives a total perceived value close to each other.

Finally, here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7, 8, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
