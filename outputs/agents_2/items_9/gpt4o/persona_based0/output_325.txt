Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  90  37  50  61  45  13  95  83
1  32  24  30  52  86  66  32  92  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while considering their valuations, let us use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. The goal is to ensure that the distribution is as envy-free as possible, meaning that each agent should feel they received an equitable share based on their preferences.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 32 + 90 + 37 + 50 + 61 + 45 + 13 + 95 + 83 = 506
- Agent 1's total valuation: 32 + 24 + 30 + 52 + 86 + 66 + 32 + 92 + 52 = 466

Now, let's allocate items in a way that attempts to balance the values they receive:

1. Both agents value item 1 highly; however, agent 0 values it the most, so we will assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 0 values item 7 the highest, so we assign item 7 to agent 0.
3. Agent 1 values item 4 highly, so we assign item 4 to agent 1.
4. Agent 0 values item 8 highly, so we assign item 8 to agent 0.
5. Agent 1 values item 5 highly, so we assign item 5 to agent 1.
6. Agent 1 values item 3 highly, so we assign item 3 to agent 1.
7. Agent 0 values item 0 highly, so we assign item 0 to agent 0.
8. Agent 1 values item 2 more than agent 0, so we assign item 2 to agent 1.
9. Finally, agent 0 values item 6 more than agent 1, so we assign item 6 to agent 0.

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 4, 5

Now, we'll format this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
