Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  64   4  40  84  22  62  51  50
1  36  81  22  63  52  16  79  24  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while striving for envy-freeness, we start by assessing the valuations. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives a set of items that they value highly, attempting to balance the total value each agent perceives in their allocation.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 79 + 64 + 4 + 40 + 84 + 22 + 62 + 51 + 50 = 456
- Agent 1's total value: 36 + 81 + 22 + 63 + 52 + 16 + 79 + 24 + 87 = 460

To achieve a fair allocation, we attempt to ensure that the total value of the items allocated to each agent is roughly equal according to their individual valuations.

Let's proceed with a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: 79 (high value for Agent 0)
   - Item 4: 84 (high value for Agent 0)
   - Item 5: 22 (low value for Agent 1)
   - Item 7: 51 (moderate value for both)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 1: 81 (high value for Agent 1)
   - Item 2: 22 (relatively low value for Agent 0)
   - Item 3: 63 (higher value for Agent 1)
   - Item 6: 79 (high value for Agent 1)
   - Item 8: 87 (high value for Agent 1)

Now, let's check the total perceived value each agent gains from the allocation:

- Agent 0's total value: 79 (Item 0) + 84 (Item 4) + 22 (Item 5) + 51 (Item 7) = 236
- Agent 1's total value: 81 (Item 1) + 22 (Item 2) + 63 (Item 3) + 79 (Item 6) + 87 (Item 8) = 332

The allocations are balanced in terms of the number of items, and while Agent 1's total perceived value is higher, the allocation adheres to giving each agent items they value significantly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6, 8]
}
```
