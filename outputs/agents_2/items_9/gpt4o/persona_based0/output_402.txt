Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  32  32  81  57  68  36  38  93
1  15  41  76  91  16  78  77  77  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an envy-free division. This means that each agent should feel that their allocated set of items is at least as valuable as the set given to the other agent, according to their own valuations.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 58 + 32 + 32 + 81 + 57 + 68 + 36 + 38 + 93 = 495
- Agent 1's total valuation: 15 + 41 + 76 + 91 + 16 + 78 + 77 + 77 + 45 = 516

Next, we'll attempt to allocate items such that each agent gets roughly half of their total value based on their own valuations. Given that there are 9 items, each agent should receive approximately 4 to 5 items.

After examining the valuations, let's proceed with an allocation that tries to balance the perceived value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0's Allocations:**
   - Items: 0, 3, 4, 8
   - Total Value: 58 + 81 + 57 + 93 = 289

2. **Agent 1's Allocations:**
   - Items: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
   - Total Value: 41 + 76 + 78 + 77 + 77 = 349

This allocation gives each agent a set of items that they value highly, minimizing potential envy. The allocation is not strictly envy-free, but it aims to balance the values each agent perceives from their allocation.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
