Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  31  90  71  92  35  58  57  88
1  47  74  62  20  24  65  91  84  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method like the adjusted winner procedure or similar fair division methods. However, in this case, since there are only two agents and a small number of items, a manual allocation approach can be applied to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly while maintaining a balance in the total value received by each agent.

First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 86 + 31 + 90 + 71 + 92 + 35 + 58 + 57 + 88 = 608
- Agent 1's total value: 47 + 74 + 62 + 20 + 24 + 65 + 91 + 84 + 72 = 539

Next, we'll aim to distribute the items so that both agents receive a fair share of the total value according to their own valuations.

Let's start by assigning items based on the highest valuation for each agent while keeping track of the total value for each:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Assign item 4 (value 92), item 2 (value 90), item 8 (value 88), item 0 (value 86)
   - Total value for Agent 0: 92 + 90 + 88 + 86 = 356

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign item 6 (value 91), item 7 (value 84), item 1 (value 74), item 5 (value 65)
   - Total value for Agent 1: 91 + 84 + 74 + 65 = 314

Now, we have assigned 8 items. We need to assign the remaining item while keeping the allocation fair:

3. The remaining item is item 3:
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 to balance the total values as much as possible.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 4, 2, 8, 0
- Agent 1 receives items: 6, 7, 1, 5, 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 8, 0],
    "1": [6, 7, 1, 5, 3]
}
```
