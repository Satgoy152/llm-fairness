Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  66   6   2  72  26  62  85  99
1   0  91  97  60  97  19  44  46  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[10 66  6  2 72 26 62 85 99]
 [ 0 91 97 60 97 19 44 46 70]]
Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. Given that the sum of the valuations across all items for each agent is different, we may not achieve perfect envy-freeness but can aim to make the allocation as fair as possible.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 10 + 66 + 6 + 2 + 72 + 26 + 62 + 85 + 99 = 428
- Agent 1's total valuation: 0 + 91 + 97 + 60 + 97 + 19 + 44 + 46 + 70 = 524

Now, let's aim for an allocation such that each agent has a fair share of their total valuation.

One approach is to use a "greedy" method that attempts to allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most, while balancing the overall value received by each agent.

Let's see an allocation:

1. Item 8: Valued highest by Agent 0 (99 vs. 70).
2. Item 2: Valued highest by Agent 1 (97 vs. 6).
3. Item 4: Valued highest by Agent 1 (97 vs. 72).
4. Item 1: Valued highest by Agent 1 (91 vs. 66).
5. Item 7: Valued highest by Agent 0 (85 vs. 46).
6. Item 6: Valued highest by Agent 0 (62 vs. 44).
7. Item 5: Valued highest by Agent 0 (26 vs. 19).
8. Item 3: Valued highest by Agent 1 (60 vs. 2).
9. Item 0: Valued highest by Agent 0 (10 vs. 0).

Let's summarize the allocation:

Agent 0: [0, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 4]

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0 a total valuation of: 10 + 26 + 62 + 85 + 99 = 282
- Agent 1 a total valuation of: 91 + 97 + 60 + 97 = 345

While not perfectly envy-free, this allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
