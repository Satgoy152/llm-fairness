Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  1  65  56  38  28  51  75  50
1   0  0  49  76  66  94  83  91  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or minimizing envy. In this problem, we aim to allocate each item to one of two agents such that each agent has an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

One approach is to use the method of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. While perfect envy-freeness might not be fully achievable with integer allocations, we can strive for the best possible allocation to minimize envy.

Let's evaluate the valuations and make allocations accordingly:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 52 + 1 + 65 + 56 + 38 + 28 + 51 + 75 + 50 = 416
   - Agent 1: 0 + 0 + 49 + 76 + 66 + 94 + 83 + 91 + 63 = 522

2. Use these valuations to guide the allocation, trying to balance the perceived fairness. We will start by assigning items that are most valued by each agent.

3. Allocate items based on highest individual valuations and try to ensure each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible.

Hereâ€™s a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 4, 7
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 52 + 65 + 38 + 75 = 230

- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 0 + 76 + 94 + 83 + 63 = 316

This allocation tries to minimize envy by allocating items based on relative valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
