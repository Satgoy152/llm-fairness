Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  66  63  50  99  26  50  77  85
1  65  69  39  68  62  86  43   6  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[87 66 63 50 99 26 50 77 85]
 [65 69 39 68 62 86 43  6 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free division. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as the allocation of the other agent according to their own valuations.

First, let's calculate the total valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0's Valuations**: 
  - Total = 87 + 66 + 63 + 50 + 99 + 26 + 50 + 77 + 85 = 603

- **Agent 1's Valuations**: 
  - Total = 65 + 69 + 39 + 68 + 62 + 86 + 43 + 6 + 79 = 517

Now, let's proceed with the allocation. We will attempt to allocate the items so that each agent receives a bundle they value highly.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**:
   - Prefers items with higher values according to their preferences.
   - High-value items for Agent 0: 4 (99), 0 (87), 8 (85), 7 (77).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Prefers items with higher values according to their preferences.
   - High-value items for Agent 1: 5 (86), 1 (69), 3 (68), 8 (79).

### Possible Allocation:
After considering both valuations and preferences, we align items to ensure each agent feels their allocation is favorable.

- **Agent 0**: [0, 4, 7]
- **Agent 1**: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8]

### Verification:
- **Agent 0's Allocation Valuation**: 87 (0) + 99 (4) + 77 (7) = 263
- **Agent 1's Allocation Valuation**: 69 (1) + 39 (2) + 68 (3) + 86 (5) + 43 (6) + 79 (8) = 384

This allocation satisfies the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. Each agent should feel they received a fair share relative to their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
