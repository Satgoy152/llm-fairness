Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2
0  79  55  31
1  91  48  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as that of any other agent, given their own valuations.

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 79 (item 0) + 55 (item 1) + 31 (item 2) = 165
- Agent 1's total valuation: 91 (item 0) + 48 (item 1) + 91 (item 2) = 230

Now, let's consider the valuations for each item in isolation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 values it at 91.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 values it at 48.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 31, Agent 1 values it at 91.

To minimize envy, we should try to allocate items such that each agent receives a total valuation that is as equal as possible.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Item 0**: Give to Agent 1 (since their valuation is higher at 91).
2. **Item 1**: Give to Agent 0 (since their valuation is higher at 55).
3. **Item 2**: Give to Agent 1 (since their valuation is higher at 91).

### Resulting Allocations

- Agent 0 receives item 1, with a total valuation of 55.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of 182 (91 + 91).

This allocation is not envy-free because Agent 0 might feel that the allocation of Agent 1 is better. However, considering the agent preferences, this allocation minimizes envy more than other possible allocations.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
