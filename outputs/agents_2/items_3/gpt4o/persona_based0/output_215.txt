Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2
0  37  65  11
1  76  31  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items and aim for an allocation that achieves an envy-free distribution as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Let's review the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 37
  - Item 1 at 65
  - Item 2 at 11

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 76
  - Item 1 at 31
  - Item 2 at 25

To aim for an envy-free allocation, let's consider the allocation based on each agent's highest-valued items first.

1. Agent 1 values Item 0 the highest at 76, so we will allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest at 65, so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. Now, Item 2 is left, and we need to decide based on remaining preferences.

- Agent 0 values Item 2 at 11.
- Agent 1 values Item 2 at 25.

Agent 1 values Item 2 higher than Agent 0 does, and since this allocation will not create envy (as each agent is receiving their most valued item left after initial allocation), we allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2.

This distribution maximizes the happiness of each agent based on their own valuations and minimizes potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
