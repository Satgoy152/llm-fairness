Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2
0  51  27  26
1  80  11  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items between the two agents (0 and 1), we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to find an allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is as fair as possible in terms of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 1: 27
  - Item 2: 26

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 80
  - Item 1: 11
  - Item 2: 79

We can observe that:

- Agent 1 highly values Item 0 (80) and Item 2 (79) compared to Agent 0's valuations.
- Agent 0 values Item 1 (27) more than Agent 1 does.

Given these observations, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign Item 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1, as they value these items significantly more than Agent 0 does.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values this item more than Agent 1.

This allocation ensures:

- Agent 0 receives the item they value more than Agent 1.
- Agent 1 receives the items they value significantly more than Agent 0.
- Both agents receive at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
