Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2
0  84  36  70
1  74  25  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents ensuring envy-freeness, we will allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly and that minimize potential envy between agents. Given the valuations:

|       | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| Agent 0 | 84     | 36     | 70     |
| Agent 1 | 74     | 25     | 46     |

One possible approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from the allocation. We will consider each agent's preference and ensure each agent receives at least one item to optimize for fairness.

**Steps to Allocate:**

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values Item 0 the most (84), followed by Item 2 (70), and then Item 1 (36).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values Item 0 the most (74), followed by Item 2 (46), and then Item 1 (25).

By observing the highest valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Item 0** is highly valued by both agents, but Agent 0 values it the most, so allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Item 2** is the second most valued item for both agents. However, since Agent 0 receives Item 0, allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 to balance the allocation.
- **Item 1** is least preferred by both agents, but it should go to Agent 0 as Agent 1 has already received Item 2.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and balances envy while ensuring each agent receives items they value relatively highly.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
