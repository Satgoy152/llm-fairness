Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2
0  24  36  63
1  53  58  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

To achieve a fair allocation that ensures envy-freeness, it's important to consider the valuation each agent has for the items. An envy-free allocation is one in which no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 24
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 63

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 53
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 54

To find an envy-free allocation, we need to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's consider the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 24 + 36 + 63 = 123
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 53 + 58 + 54 = 165

We can allocate the items as follows:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as it is the highest-valued item for Agent 0.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as it is the highest-valued item for Agent 1 after Agent 0 takes Item 2.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as this will maximize Agent 1's remaining value.

Now let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation is envy-free because:

- Agent 0 receives Item 2, which is their highest-valued item and makes them satisfied with their allocation.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1, which together give them a higher value than any single item Agent 0 could receive, ensuring they do not envy Agent 0.
