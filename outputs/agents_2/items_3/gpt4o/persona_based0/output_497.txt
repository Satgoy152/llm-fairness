Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2
0  63   5  35
1   4  54  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as fair as possible, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to ensure that each agent feels that they are getting an equitable share based on their valuations.

The valuations are given as follows:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 63
  - Item 1: 5
  - Item 2: 35

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 4
  - Item 1: 54
  - Item 2: 97

A straightforward allocation approach could be to assign each agent the item they value most, while ensuring all items are distributed. Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0 receives Item 0:**
   - Value for Agent 0: 63
   - Remaining items: Item 1, Item 2

2. **Agent 1 receives Item 2:**
   - Value for Agent 1: 97
   - Remaining item: Item 1

3. **Assign the remaining item (Item 1) to Agent 0:**
   - Value for Agent 0: 5

Total allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1 (Total Value: 63 + 5 = 68)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (Total Value: 97)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and their highest or second-highest valued item, making it reasonably fair given their respective valuations. Agent 1 receives their highest valued item, and Agent 0 receives two items to balance the total value received.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
