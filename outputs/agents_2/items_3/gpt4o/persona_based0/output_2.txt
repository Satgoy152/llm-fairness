Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2
0  78   1  69
1  66  85  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and distributes the items as evenly as possible, considering the agents' valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 1
  - Item 2: 69

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 22

One approach to achieving a fair allocation is to use the "maximum sum of valuations" method, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 78, while Agent 1 values it at 66. So, allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 1, while Agent 1 values it at 85. So, allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 69, while Agent 1 values it at 22. So, allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives the items they value the most (Items 0 and 2), and Agent 1 receives the item they value highly (Item 1). This allocation minimizes potential envy and is efficient given the valuations.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
