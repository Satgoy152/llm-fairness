Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2
0  29   2  63
1  33  94  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering the valuations provided, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or at least minimizes envy. Here's the valuation matrix for clarification:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 29
  - Item 1: 2
  - Item 2: 63

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 94
  - Item 2: 56

To approach this, we can assume each agent should get the item they value the most, while ensuring the total allocation equals the number of available items (3 in this case).

1. **Agent 0's preferences (sorted by value):**  
   - Item 2 (63)
   - Item 0 (29)
   - Item 1 (2)

2. **Agent 1's preferences (sorted by value):**  
   - Item 1 (94)
   - Item 2 (56)
   - Item 0 (33)

Based on these preferences:

- Agent 1 values Item 1 the most. We assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values Item 2 the most. We assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
- The remaining item is Item 0. Agent 0 has a higher valuation for Item 0 than Agent 1, so we assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and it attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent the item they value the most or next in line.

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
