Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2
0  42  13  61
1  30  57  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 57 98]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their own valuations. This task involves finding an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints.

The valuation table is as follows:

```
Agent 0: Item 0 = 42, Item 1 = 13, Item 2 = 61
Agent 1: Item 0 = 30, Item 1 = 57, Item 2 = 98
```

One possible approach to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize each agent's perceived value of the items they receive while minimizing envy.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest (value = 61).
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest (value = 98).

2. **Allocate the highest valued items:**
   - Since both agents value Item 2 the highest, we must decide based on remaining values for other items:
     - If Agent 0 gets Item 2, Agent 1 can get Items 0 and 1, which they value significantly (30 + 57 = 87).
     - If Agent 1 gets Item 2, Agent 0 can get Items 0 and 1, which they value less (42 + 13 = 55).

3. **Optimal Allocation:**
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1, as this maximizes their total value.
   - Allocate Items 0 and 1 to Agent 0, which although not as high as Agent 1's total, provides a larger sum than if Agent 0 received Item 2.

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 receiving Items 0 and 1 (total value = 42 + 13 = 55).
- Agent 1 receiving Item 2 (total value = 98).

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's perceived value and providing Agent 1 their most valued item.

### Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
