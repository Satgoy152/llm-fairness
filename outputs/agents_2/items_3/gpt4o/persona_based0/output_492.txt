Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2
0  28  64  93
1  85   7  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [85  7 81]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that is envy-free or as close to it as possible, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 28
  - Item 1: 64
  - Item 2: 93

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 85
  - Item 1: 7
  - Item 2: 81

To find an allocation, we can use the following approach:

1. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 93, which is the highest value among all items for Agent 0. 
   - Agent 1 values it at 81, which is less than what Agent 0 values it at.

2. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 85, which is the highest value among all items for Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values it at 28, which is significantly less than what Agent 1 values it at.

3. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0**:
   - Item 1 has a higher value for Agent 0 (64) than for Agent 1 (7).

Now, each agent has received items such that the distribution aims to minimize envy and maximize fairness based on their valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
