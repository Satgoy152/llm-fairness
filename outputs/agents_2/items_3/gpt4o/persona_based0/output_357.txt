Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2
0  30  77  51
1  39  30  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents such that the allocation is envy-free, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent feels that they would be better off with another agent's allocation based on their own valuation. 

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 30
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 51

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 39
  - Item 1: 30
  - Item 2: 36

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we need to consider the preferences of each agent and try to balance the total value of the items allocated to each agent according to their own valuation.

One possible allocation strategy is to initially assign each agent the item they value the most, if possible, and then adjust to ensure that each agent gets an equal or nearly equal share of value according to their own valuations.

Step-by-step allocation:
1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 since it is the highest-valued item for them (77).
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 since it is the highest-valued item for them (39).
3. Allocate the remaining item 2. We need to check which allocation would minimize envy:
   - Agent 0 would value item 2 as 51, giving them a total value of 77 + 51 = 128.
   - Agent 1 would value item 2 as 36, giving them a total value of 39 + 36 = 75.

Given the current allocations, Agent 0 has a higher total valuation compared to Agent 1. To balance this, we can assign item 2 to Agent 1 to reduce envy, as this gives a fairer distribution:

- Agent 0 gets item 1, valued at 77.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2, valued at 39 + 36 = 75.

This allocation is fairly balanced and reduces the possible envy between the agents.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
