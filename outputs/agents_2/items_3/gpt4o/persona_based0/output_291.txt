Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

   0   1   2
0  5  88  47
1  1  60  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 1 60 51]]
Output:
To determine a fair allocation of these items between the two agents, we want to aim for an envy-free allocation, which means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over the other agent's allocation based on their valuations.

Here is the valuation table for clarity:
- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 5
  - Item 1: 88
  - Item 2: 47

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 1
  - Item 1: 60
  - Item 2: 51

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0 gets Item 1, Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 88
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 1 + 51 = 52
   - Agent 0 prefers their allocation since 88 > 52.

2. **Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 2, Agent 1 gets Item 1:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 5 + 47 = 52
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 60
   - Agent 1 prefers their allocation since 60 > 52.

3. **Agent 0 gets Item 2, Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 1:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 47
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 1 + 60 = 61
   - Agent 1 prefers their allocation since 61 > 47.

Among these allocations, the first allocation seems to be fair since each agent prefers their allocation over the other. Thus, the fair allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
