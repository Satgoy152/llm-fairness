Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2
0  11  55  63
1  55  94  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should try to allocate the items in a way that each agent feels they have received an equitable share based on their valuations.

The valuations given are:

- Agent 0: Item 0 = 11, Item 1 = 55, Item 2 = 63
- Agent 1: Item 0 = 55, Item 1 = 94, Item 2 = 43

To achieve envy-freeness, we want to ensure that no agent prefers the allocation of the other agent over their own allocation. One approach is to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, considering their valuations.

Let's consider the potential allocations:

1. **Allocation 1:**
   - Agent 0 gets Item 2
   - Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 1

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 63
   - Agent 1: 55 + 94 = 149

   In this allocation, Agent 0 receives their highest-valued item, and Agent 1 receives their two highest-valued items.

2. **Allocation 2:**
   - Agent 0 gets Item 1
   - Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 55
   - Agent 1: 55 + 43 = 98

   In this allocation, Agent 0 receives their second highest-valued item, and Agent 1 receives a combination of their highest and lowest-valued items.

3. **Allocation 3:**
   - Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 1
   - Agent 1 gets Item 2

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 11 + 55 = 66
   - Agent 1: 43

   In this allocation, Agent 0 receives their two lowest-valued items, and Agent 1 receives their lowest-valued item.

Among these, Allocation 1 seems to be the most balanced in terms of maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring envy-freeness.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
