Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2
0   1  45  95
1  20  94  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between two agents (0 and 1) based on their valuations, we should consider a method that tries to minimize envy. One common approach to achieve fairness is the concept of an "envy-free" allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent given their valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [1, 45, 95]
- Agent 1's valuations: [20, 94, 26]

We need to allocate all three items (0, 1, and 2) such that the allocation is as fair as possible. 

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. If Agent 0 receives item 2 (valued highest by Agent 0), and Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1:
   - Agent 0's total value: 95
   - Agent 1's total value: 20 (item 0) + 94 (item 1) = 114

2. If Agent 1 receives item 1 (valued highest by Agent 1), and Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2:
   - Agent 0's total value: 1 (item 0) + 95 (item 2) = 96
   - Agent 1's total value: 94

Given these allocations, let's choose the one that minimizes envy. Option 1 seems more balanced because the total values are closer (95 vs. 114) compared to option 2 (96 vs. 94). Although neither allocation is perfectly envy-free, option 1 appears to be the fairer choice given the constraints.

Thus, the allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
