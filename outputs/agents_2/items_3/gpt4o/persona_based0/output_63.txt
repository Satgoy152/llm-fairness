Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2
0  59  11  93
1  26  70  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 70 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. In this case, since there are only two agents and three items, perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable due to the indivisibility of items. However, we can attempt to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent's allocation is as valuable as possible based on their individual valuations.

Here is the valuation matrix for clarity:

```
        Items
        0   1   2
     ------------
Agent 0 | 59  11  93
Agent 1 | 26  70  49
```

To determine the best allocation:

1. **Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 59 + 11 + 93 = 163
   - Agent 1: 26 + 70 + 49 = 145

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items to maximize each agent's valuation while minimizing potential envy.

3. **Possible Allocation:**
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0: 93).
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1: 70).
   - For Item 0, Agent 0 values it at 59 and Agent 1 at 26. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as it has a significantly higher value for them.

Thus, the allocation that minimizes envy and maximizes the agents' satisfaction is:

- Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets Item 1.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
