Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2
0  91  63  22
1  54  86  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their allocation to be at least as valuable as the allocation of any other agent.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 0 = 91, Item 1 = 63, Item 2 = 22
- Agent 1: Item 0 = 54, Item 1 = 86, Item 2 = 32

One approach to achieve envy-freeness is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's perceived value while ensuring each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to others.

Let's try an allocation:

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0. This gives Agent 0 a value of 91.
2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1. This gives Agent 1 a value of 86.
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1. This gives Agent 1 an additional value of 32.

Now let's evaluate:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0 with a total value of 91.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2 with a total value of 118 (86 + 32).

In this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives a high-valued item, which should satisfy them given the constraints.
- Agent 1 receives two items with a combined higher value, which reflects their preferences and should satisfy them as well.

This allocation is envy-free under the assumption that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the other, given the distribution of values.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
