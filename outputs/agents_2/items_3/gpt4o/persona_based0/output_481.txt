Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2
0  59  84  16
1  52   4  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to look at the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their valuations. Here's the valuation table for reference:

```
    Items
    0   1   2
0  59  84  16
1  52   4  94
```

Let's analyze the situation:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 59, Item 1 = 84, Item 2 = 16
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 52, Item 1 = 4, Item 2 = 94

We can attempt to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation from their allocated items. Here's a simple allocation strategy:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this item significantly higher than Agent 1 (84 vs. 4). Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values this item significantly higher than Agent 0 (94 vs. 16). Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 0**: Both agents value this item somewhat similarly, but to balance the allocations and maximize total value for each, we can allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, as they get a higher combined value from Items 0 and 1 compared to having only Item 1.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Item 2

This allocation maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations and ensures no agent envies the other's allocation based on their perceived value.

Here is the json representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
