Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2
0  94   3  92
1  88  43  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible, given the valuations provided. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: Item 0 = 94, Item 1 = 3, Item 2 = 92
Agent 1: Item 0 = 88, Item 1 = 43, Item 2 = 64
```

One way to approach this problem is to look at the valuations and try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while minimizing envy. Here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** highly values Item 0 and Item 2. 
- **Agent 1** could get Item 1, which is more valuable to Agent 1 than to Agent 0.

We can allocate the items as follows:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (valued at 94) because it's the most valuable item for Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (valued at 92), which is also valuable to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (valued at 43), which is more valuable to Agent 1 than Agent 0.

This allocation satisfies the condition of giving each agent an integer number of items and ensures that all items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 gets items they highly value, and Agent 1 gets the item they value more than Agent 0 does, thus minimizing envy under the given constraints.
