Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2
0  82  27  63
1  76   4  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with respect to their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agentâ€™s allocation, according to their own valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 82
  - Item 1: 27
  - Item 2: 63
  
- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 76
  - Item 1: 4
  - Item 2: 37

Next, we'll evaluate how to allocate the three items between the two agents to minimize envy:

1. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values this item at 82, while Agent 1 values it at 76. It's beneficial to allocate this item to Agent 0 since they value it more.

2. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values this item at 63, while Agent 1 values it at 37. Again, Agent 0 has a higher valuation for this item.

3. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 0 values this item at 27, while Agent 1 values it at 4. Item 1 is better allocated to Agent 1 since Agent 0 already has two items and adding this item would increase the imbalance in perceived value between the agents.

This allocation respects the total count constraint (3 items in total) and strives to minimize envy, as Agent 0 receives the items they value most, and Agent 1 receives the remaining item.

The allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
