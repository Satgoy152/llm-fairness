Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2
0  44  59  30
1  89  51  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall satisfaction of the agents. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that minimizes envy and maximizes their individual valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has valuations: [44, 59, 30]
- Agent 1 has valuations: [89, 51, 54]

To achieve a fair division, we will aim to maximize the total value received by each agent based on their preferences, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, as there are only two agents and three items.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 44.
   - Agent 1 values it at 89.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 for higher total value.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 59.
   - Agent 1 values it at 51.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 for higher total value.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 30.
   - Agent 1 values it at 54.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 for higher total value.

### Resulting Allocation

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that reflects their preferences as much as possible, given the constraints of integer allocations.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
