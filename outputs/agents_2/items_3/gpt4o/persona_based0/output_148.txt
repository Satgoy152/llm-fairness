Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2
0  26  93  67
1   6  49  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to take into account each agent's valuation of the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that no agent envies the other, meaning each agent should receive a bundle of items they value as much or more than the other agent's bundle.

Given the valuation table:

```
Agent \ Item |  0   |  1   |  2
-----------------------------
    0        |  26  |  93  |  67
    1        |  6   |  49  |  17
```

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0: Values items as 26, 93, and 67. Total value = 26 + 93 + 67 = 186
- Agent 1: Values items as 6, 49, and 17. Total value = 6 + 49 + 17 = 72

A possible envy-free allocation strategy is to focus on maximizing each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations. Given the large disparity in valuations, one potential allocation is:

1. Assign item 1, which has the highest value for agent 0, to agent 0.
2. Assign items 0 and 2 to agent 1, as these items are less valuable to agent 0 compared to item 1, while still providing some value to agent 1.

Let's check the valuations under this allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 1: Value = 93
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2: Value = 6 + 17 = 23

This allocation ensures that agent 0 receives the most valued single item, and agent 1 receives both remaining items to maximize their total value from the available options.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
