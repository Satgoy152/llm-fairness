Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2
0  63   9  24
1  84  44  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation and attempt envy-freeness between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and assign the items to maximize each agent's total valuation, while ensuring that both agents feel they are receiving a fair share.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 63
  - Item 1 at 9
  - Item 2 at 24

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 84
  - Item 1 at 44
  - Item 2 at 64

One potential way to achieve a fair allocation is by using a max-min approach to ensure both agents end up with relatively high valuations from their perspective.

Let's analyze the scenario:

1. **Item 0**: Highly valued by both agents, but Agent 1 values it more. Assigning this item to Agent 1 might minimize envy.
2. **Item 1**: Less valued by both, but more by Agent 1 than by Agent 0. Assigning it to Agent 0 helps balance the allocation.
3. **Item 2**: Highly valued by Agent 1 but reasonably by Agent 0 as well. To balance the distribution, assigning it to Agent 0 seems plausible.

Thus, a fair allocation could be:
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 and Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: 9 (Item 1) + 24 (Item 2) = 33
- Agent 1: 84 (Item 0)

Though Agent 1 receives a higher value total, the distribution attempts to minimize envy since Agent 0 still receives two items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
