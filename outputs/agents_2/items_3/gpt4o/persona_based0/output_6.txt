Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2
0   5  37  42
1  42  61  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In the context of fair division and envy-freeness, the goal is to allocate items in such a way that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2
0   5  37  42
1  42  61  56
```

Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
- Item 0: 5
- Item 1: 37
- Item 2: 42

Agent 1 values the items as follows:
- Item 0: 42
- Item 1: 61
- Item 2: 56

A simple method to achieve an envy-free allocation is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's examine each item:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 42, while Agent 0 values it at 5. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 61, while Agent 0 values it at 37. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 42, while Agent 1 values it at 56. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

However, this allocation gives all items to Agent 1, leaving Agent 0 with nothing. Instead, we should aim for a distribution where each agent receives at least one item, ensuring an integer allocation of items.

To balance the allocation:
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it highest.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as it's their highest valued item among those left.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, since Agent 0's valuation of 37 is significant and Agent 1 already has Item 0.

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
