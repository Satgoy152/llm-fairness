Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2
0  11  70  70
1  51   4  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent to their own. Here's the valuation table for clarity:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   11   |   70   |   70   |
|   1   |   51   |   4    |   64   |

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values Item 1 and Item 2 equally at 70, which are the highest values for them.
- Agent 1 values Item 0 the highest at 51, followed by Item 2 at 64.

A possible fair allocation that minimizes envy could be:

- Give Agent 0 the item they value the most, Item 1.
- Give Agent 1 the item they value the most, Item 0.
- Give Agent 0 Item 2, as they also value it highly, and Agent 1 will not envy because their highest value is Item 0, which they have already received.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 2, with a total valuation of 140.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0, with a valuation of 51.

In JSON format, this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint that all items must be allocated and attempts to distribute them in a way that reduces potential envy based on their valuations.
