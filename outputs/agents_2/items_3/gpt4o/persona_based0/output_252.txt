Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2
0  66  20  24
1  55  99   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring an envy-free division, we should consider the valuations of each agent for each item. Our goal is to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Here is the valuation matrix for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 66     | 20     | 24     |
| 1     | 55     | 99     | 9      |

To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we should focus on the highest values each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute them in a manner that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**:
   - Item 0: 66
   - Item 1: 20
   - Item 2: 24

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:
   - Item 0: 55
   - Item 1: 99
   - Item 2: 9

**Allocation Strategy**:
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 1 (99 compared to Agent 0's 20), so it is reasonable to allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 0 (66 compared to Agent 1's 55), so it makes sense to allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
- The remaining Item 2 has a higher valuation for Agent 0 (24 compared to Agent 1's 9), so Item 2 should also be allocated to Agent 0.

By following this strategy, each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their own valuations, and neither agent envies the other's allocation.

**Final Allocation**:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, the total number of items allocated is exactly three, and the allocation is envy-free based on the given valuations.
