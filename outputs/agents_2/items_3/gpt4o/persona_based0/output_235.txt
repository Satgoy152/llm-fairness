Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2
0  12  78  84
1  24  79  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly, we need to consider the valuations provided. The goal here is to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all items are distributed.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items:
  - 0 at 12
  - 1 at 78
  - 2 at 84

- Agent 1 values items:
  - 0 at 24
  - 1 at 79
  - 2 at 57

A possible approach to achieve an envy-free or near envy-free allocation is to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's preference for the items they receive, while ensuring that no agent envies the allocation of another.

Let's analyze the scenario:

1. **Item 2**: This is the most valued item for Agent 0 (84) and highly valued by Agent 1 (57). 
2. **Item 1**: Highly valued by both agents, with Agent 1 valuing it slightly higher (79 vs. 78).
3. **Item 0**: Valued lower by both, but Agent 1 values it higher than Agent 0 (24 vs. 12).

A reasonable allocation to minimize envy could be:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (as it's their highest valued item).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (as they value it slightly more than Agent 0).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (as they value it more than Agent 0).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value most, while minimizing potential envy. 

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
