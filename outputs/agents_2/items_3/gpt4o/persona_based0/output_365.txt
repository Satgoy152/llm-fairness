Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2
0  85  22  14
1  70  99  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close as possible to it, given the discrete nature of the items. An envy-free allocation means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation given to any other agent.

Agent 0 valuations:
- Item 0: 85
- Item 1: 22
- Item 2: 14

Agent 1 valuations:
- Item 0: 70
- Item 1: 99
- Item 2: 76

We can approach this by looking at which items the agents value the most and try to allocate them in a way that maximizes each agent's valuation of their own bundle.

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (99) and item 2 (76), more than Agent 0 does. 
2. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (85), more than Agent 1 does.

Based on these valuations, an intuitive and fair allocation could be:
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0
- Assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 1

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value the most, minimizing potential envy.

Hereâ€™s the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
