Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2
0  94  78  95
1  35  50  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that is envy-free, we need to consider the preferences or valuations each agent has for the items and aim to allocate items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the other agent's allocation.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 94
  - Item 1: 78
  - Item 2: 95

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 50
  - Item 2: 81

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items and ensure that each agent prefers their allocation over the other's allocation.

Let's analyze possible allocations:

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 and Items 0 and 1 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0 would receive Item 2, valued at 95.
   - Agent 1 would receive Items 0 and 1, valued at 35 + 50 = 85.
   - In this allocation, Agent 0 values their allocation more than Agent 1, and Agent 1 receives two items, which might be perceived as fair given the total value.

2. **Allocate Items 0 and 1 to Agent 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0 would receive Items 0 and 1, valued at 94 + 78 = 172.
   - Agent 1 would receive Item 2, valued at 81.
   - This allocation favors Agent 0 significantly in terms of value, making it less fair.

3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 and Items 1 and 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0 would receive Item 0, valued at 94.
   - Agent 1 would receive Items 1 and 2, valued at 50 + 81 = 131.
   - This allocation gives Agent 1 a higher total valuation than Agent 0.

Given these options, option 1 (Allocating Item 2 to Agent 0 and Items 0 and 1 to Agent 1) appears to be the most balanced in terms of perceived fairness, as it maintains a closer balance in total valuations and gives each agent an incentive to prefer their own allocation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
