Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2
0  35  40  63
1  44  58  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent feels they are receiving a fair share according to their own valuation.

The given valuations are:

- Agent 0: Item 0 = 35, Item 1 = 40, Item 2 = 63
- Agent 1: Item 0 = 44, Item 1 = 58, Item 2 = 97

To achieve a fair allocation, we can consider a strategy that minimizes envy. One approach is to allocate items in such a way that each agent receives the items that maximize their perceived value.

Let's evaluate the total valuations for each item from both agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 values it at 44. Total = 79
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 values it at 58. Total = 98
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 63, Agent 1 values it at 97. Total = 160

The highest valued item (Item 2) should ideally go to the agent who values it the most, which is Agent 1.

Remaining items (Item 0 and Item 1) are then considered for allocation to balance the total value perceived by each agent.

Let's allocate:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 has higher value for it than Agent 0).
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (since Agent 1 already has more value from Items 1 and 2).

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2

Now, present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
