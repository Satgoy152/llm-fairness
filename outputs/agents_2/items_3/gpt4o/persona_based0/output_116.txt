Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2
0  46  25  97
1  42  86  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible or at least ensures each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [46, 25, 97]
- Agent 1's valuations: [42, 86, 28]

One approach is to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences. We can attempt to allocate items to minimize envy and maximize fairness. Let's consider the following possible allocations:

1. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 2 the most (97), while Agent 1 values it at 28. Thus, giving item 2 to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.
2. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 1 the most (86), while Agent 0 values it at 25. Assigning item 1 to Agent 1 ensures they receive the item they value most.
3. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 0 at 46, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 42. Giving item 0 to Agent 0 optimizes their allocation further.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items such that their satisfaction is maximized based on their own valuations. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences while making sure all items are allocated.
