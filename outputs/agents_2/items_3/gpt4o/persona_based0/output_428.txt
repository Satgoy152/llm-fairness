Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2
0  23  20  27
1  64  77   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is exactly three, we can aim for envy-freeness or ensure that each agent is satisfied as much as possible with their allocation relative to the given valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 23
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 27

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 9

To achieve a fair allocation, we need to consider the preferences of both agents. One approach is to allocate items in a way that minimizes any potential envy between agents. We will try to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Allocation 1:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
   - Agent 1: Item [1]

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 23 (Item 0) + 27 (Item 2) = 50
   - Agent 1: 77 (Item 1)

2. **Allocation 2:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
   - Agent 1: Item [0]

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 20 (Item 1) + 27 (Item 2) = 47
   - Agent 1: 64 (Item 0)

3. **Allocation 3:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
   - Agent 1: Item [2]

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 23 (Item 0) + 20 (Item 1) = 43
   - Agent 1: 9 (Item 2)

From the above allocations, Allocation 1 maximizes the satisfaction for both agents based on their respective valuations. Agent 0 receives items they value at a total of 50, while Agent 1 receives an item they value at 77. This allocation attempts to balance the overall satisfaction and minimize envy.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
