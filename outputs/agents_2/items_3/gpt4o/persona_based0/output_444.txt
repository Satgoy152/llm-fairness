Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2
0   8  21  58
1  52  46  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while minimizing envy and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can consider the agents' valuations and try to achieve an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation means each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as they value any other agent's bundle.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: Item 0 = 8, Item 1 = 21, Item 2 = 58
- Agent 1's valuations: Item 0 = 52, Item 1 = 46, Item 2 = 81

Let's consider possible allocations:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, and Items 1 and 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 receives Items [1, 2], with a total valuation of 21 + 58 = 79.
- Agent 1 receives Item [0], with a total valuation of 52.

In this scenario, neither agent envies the other because:
- Agent 0 values their items at 79, which is more than the 8+21 = 29 they would get from Items [0, 1] or 8+58 = 66 from Items [0, 2].
- Agent 1 values their items at 52, which is more than the 46+81 = 127 they would get from Items [1, 2] if they had both.

Therefore, the allocation minimizes envy and is fair based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
