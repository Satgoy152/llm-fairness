Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2
0  12  71  44
1  88  42  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method like maximizing the total valuation each agent receives or trying to minimize any envy between the agents.

Let's start by considering the total value each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 12
  - Item 1: 71
  - Item 2: 44

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 88
  - Item 1: 42
  - Item 2: 81

A straightforward way to approach this is to allocate each item to the agent who values it most. However, we should ensure that the allocation is generally fair and minimizes envy.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 12.
   - Agent 1 values it at 88.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**. (Agent 1 values it significantly more)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 71.
   - Agent 1 values it at 42.
   - **Allocate to Agent 0**. (Agent 0 values it more)

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 44.
   - Agent 1 values it at 81.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**. (Agent 1 values it more)

### Resulting Allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 2

This allocation aims to give each agent items they value highly, which should lead to a fair division. Agent 1 receives more items but less overall value, balancing the allocation.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
