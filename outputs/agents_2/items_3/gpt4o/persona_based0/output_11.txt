Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2
0  55  11  92
1  26  23  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items based on the given valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free, meaning no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own, given their valuations.

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 11
  - Item 2: 92

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 23
  - Item 2: 43

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can consider the sum of valuations for each agent and allocate items in a manner that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation of each agent for all items:
   - Agent 0: 55 + 11 + 92 = 158
   - Agent 1: 26 + 23 + 43 = 92

2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 values it at 26. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 11, Agent 1 values it at 23. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 43. Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation is envy-free because:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2, with a total value of 147, which is more than how they value any other bundle they could receive.
- Agent 1 receives Item 1, with a value of 23, which is the highest value they can get given the constraints.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
