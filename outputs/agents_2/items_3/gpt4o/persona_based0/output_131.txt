Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2
0  82  65  17
1   2  91  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation and attempt to achieve envy-freeness, we will try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent would prefer the bundle of items another agent received over their own, given their valuations.

Let's look at the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: item 0 = 82, item 1 = 65, item 2 = 17.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: item 0 = 2, item 1 = 91, item 2 = 97.

To determine the allocation, we can aim to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 82.
   - Agent 1 values it at 2.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 because they value it much higher.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 65.
   - Agent 1 values it at 91.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 because they value it higher.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 17.
   - Agent 1 values it at 97.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because they value it higher.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]

This allocation is envy-free because neither agent would prefer the other's allocation over their own, given their respective valuations.

The final allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
