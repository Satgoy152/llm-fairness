Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2
0  61  92  61
1  50  94   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents so that the allocation is envy-free, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item and aim to minimize envy between the agents. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's examine the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 61, Item 1 at 92, Item 2 at 61.
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 50, Item 1 at 94, Item 2 at 7.

To achieve a fair division, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify the highest-valued items for each agent**:  
   - For Agent 0, the highest value is for Item 1 (92).
   - For Agent 1, the highest value is also for Item 1 (94).

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**:  
   Since Agent 1 values Item 1 the most, we can assign it to them. This also reduces the potential for envy from Agent 1.

3. **Consider the remaining items (0 and 2)**:
   - Agent 0 values both Item 0 and Item 2 equally (61 each).
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 50 and Item 2 at 7.

4. **Allocate remaining items to Agent 0**:  
   Since Agent 0 values Items 0 and 2 equally and both are higher than Agent 1â€™s valuation of Item 2, we can assign Items 0 and 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value significantly and minimizes envy because neither agent feels they have received less value than the other.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
