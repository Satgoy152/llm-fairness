Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2
0  51  43  16
1  71  76  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while attempting to maintain envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0 at 51
  - Item 1 at 43
  - Item 2 at 16

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 71
  - Item 1 at 76
  - Item 2 at 22

Our goal is to allocate each item to one of the agents such that the total valuation for each agent is maximized, and no agent envies the other for their allocation.

1. Start by assigning items based on the highest valuation from each agent's perspective. 
2. For Agent 1, item 1 has the highest valuation (76), so assign item 1 to Agent 1. 
3. For Agent 0, item 0 has the highest valuation (51), so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
4. Finally, assign the remaining item 2. Agent 1 has a higher valuation for item 2 (22 vs. 16), so it makes sense to assign item 2 also to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their individual valuation as much as possible given the constraints.
