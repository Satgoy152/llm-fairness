Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2
0  16  83  53
1  11  49  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where neither agent envies the other, while each agent receives an integer number of items. First, we'll examine the valuations to determine an envy-free allocation, if possible.

### Valuations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 16
  - Item 1: 83
  - Item 2: 53

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 11
  - Item 1: 49
  - Item 2: 31

### Analysis:

The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent values their bundle at least as much as the bundle of the other agent. We will look for a combination where the total value of the items assigned to each agent is as balanced as possible, considering the given valuations.

Let's try the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.

### Valuation Summary for Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Value of item 1 + Value of item 2 = 83 + 53 = 136

- **Agent 1:**
  - Value of item 0 = 11

Agent 0 values their bundle at 136, and Agent 1 values their bundle at 11. Here, Agent 1 might envy Agent 0 because their valuation is significantly lower. Therefore, we need to explore another potential allocation.

Let's try:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

### Valuation Summary for Revised Allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Value of item 1 = 83

- **Agent 1:**
  - Value of item 0 + Value of item 2 = 11 + 31 = 42

In this allocation:

- Agent 0 values their bundle at 83.
- Agent 1 values their bundle at 42.

Agent 0 might still be happier with their allocation, but given the constraints, this allocation ensures both agents have received items and attempts to balance the high value item distribution.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
