Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2
0  98  61   0
1  84  52  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to allocate all items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible, given integer allocations.

Here's a breakdown of the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 0

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 84
  - Item 1: 52
  - Item 2: 97

To achieve envy-freeness, we can look for allocations where each agent gets items they value highly, ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Allocation Option:**
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (98)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (52) and Item 2 (97)

   In this allocation:
   - Agent 0 receives item 0, which they value the highest.
   - Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2, which they value at 52 and 97, respectively.

This allocation is envy-free because:
- Agent 0 receives their highest-valued item.
- Agent 1 receives two items, which together are highly valued for them.

Thus, the fair allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
