Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2
0  82  71  12
1  12  68  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we can consider each agent's valuation for each item. Our goal is to allocate all items such that each agent's bundle maximizes their satisfaction based on their reported valuations, and if possible, ensure that no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 82
  - Item 1: 71
  - Item 2: 12

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 12
  - Item 1: 68
  - Item 2: 91

To start, we can allocate the items by examining which agent values each item the most:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item at 82, while Agent 1 values it at 12. Therefore, Item 0 should be allocated to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this item at 71, and Agent 1 values it at 68. Agent 0 has a slightly higher valuation for Item 1, so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item at 12, and Agent 1 values it at 91. Clearly, Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest, so it should be allocated to Agent 1.

With this allocation, Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1, while Agent 1 receives Item 2. This allocation maximizes each agent's total value from the items they receive:

- Agent 0 receives a total value of 82 + 71 = 153.
- Agent 1 receives a total value of 91.

This allocation provides the highest possible value to each agent based on their valuations, and each agent receives an integer number of items. It may not be envy-free due to the nature of the valuations, but it does strive for fairness by maximizing individual satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
