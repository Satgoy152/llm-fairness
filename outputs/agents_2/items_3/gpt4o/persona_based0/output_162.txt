Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2
0  18  82  20
1  53  85  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation is envy-free to the extent possible. An envy-free allocation is one in which no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 1: 82
  - Item 2: 20

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 53
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 27

A simple approach is to allocate items to agents such that each agent's total value is maximized for their allocation, while ensuring that the allocation is approximately envy-free.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1:**  
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 at 85, which is the highest valuation between both agents for any item.
   - This allocation maximizes Agent 1's valuation for at least one item.

2. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1:**  
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 53, which is higher than Agent 0â€™s valuation of 18.
   - This ensures that Agent 1 is satisfied with their allocation so far.

3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0:**  
   - Only one item is left and must be allocated to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 20, while Agent 1 values it at 27.
   - Allocating Item 2 to Agent 0 helps balance the allocation, as Agent 0 gets at least one item.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 gets Item 2, valued at 20.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 1, valued at 53 and 85, respectively.

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the valuations, with Agent 1 receiving more items but maximizing the value they receive based on their preferences.

**Output in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
