Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2
0  95  89   8
1  54  67  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Here's the table of valuations for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 95     | 89     | 8      |
| 1     | 54     | 67     | 73     |

To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation, we can go through the following steps:

1. **Agent 0** values Item 0 the highest (95), so it should be allocated to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** values Item 2 the highest (73), so it should be allocated to Agent 1.

3. The remaining item, Item 1, is valued at 89 by Agent 0 and 67 by Agent 1. To maintain fairness and maximize overall satisfaction, we can allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 1.

This allocation maximizes the satisfaction based on each agent's valuations and minimizes potential envy.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
