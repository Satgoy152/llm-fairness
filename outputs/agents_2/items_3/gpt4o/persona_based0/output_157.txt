Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2
0  55  99   9
1  81  28  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [81 28 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy. 

Here's the valuation table again for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   55   |   99   |    9   |
|   1   |   81   |   28   |   78   |

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can follow these steps:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 99, and agent 1 values it at 28. Giving item 1 to agent 0 will minimize envy as agent 0 values it much more than agent 1.

2. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 at 81, which is higher than agent 0's valuation of 55. Assigning item 0 to agent 1 minimizes agent 1's envy of agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values item 2 at 78, and agent 0 values it at 9. Giving item 2 to agent 1 will keep agent 1 satisfied since they have a higher valuation for it.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, minimizing potential envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
