Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2
0  26  27  20
1  33  75  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share of what is available based on their own valuations.

Here's a breakdown of the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 27
  - Item 2: 20

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 12

To achieve a fair division:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** 
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 the most (27).
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the most (75).

2. **Allocate the Most Valued Item First:**
   - Since both agents value Item 1 highly, it would be strategically fair to give Item 1 to Agent 1, as their valuation of it is significantly higher (75 vs. 27).

3. **Allocate the Remaining Items:**
   - After allocating Item 1 to Agent 1, we need to allocate Items 0 and 2.
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 33 and Item 2 at 12.
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 26 and Item 2 at 20.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (since 33 > 26) and Item 2 to Agent 0 (since 20 > 12).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives Item 2.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1.

This distribution ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation considers their preferences to minimize envy.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
