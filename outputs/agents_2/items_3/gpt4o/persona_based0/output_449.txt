Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2
0  54  91   5
1  49  50  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy between the agents, we can consider each agent's valuation of the items and allocate the items accordingly. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that both agents feel they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations from the table:

- Agent 0's valuations:
  - Item 0: 54
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 5

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 49
  - Item 1: 50
  - Item 2: 62

To find a fair allocation, we aim to maximize the total value perceived by each agent for the items they receive while ensuring the allocation is envy-free.

1. **Item 1** is highly valued by both agents, but it is the most valued for Agent 0 (91 vs. 50). Hence, we can allocate **Item 1 to Agent 0**.
2. **Item 2** is more highly valued by Agent 1 (62 vs. 5). Thus, we can allocate **Item 2 to Agent 1**.
3. **Item 0** is the next most valued item for Agent 0 (54 vs. 49). Since Agent 0 already received Item 1, we can allocate **Item 0 to Agent 1** to balance the total perceived value by each agent.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they perceive to be of high value based on their preferences. Let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation should satisfy the requirement of assigning all items and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Agent 0 receives Item 1, and Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2.
