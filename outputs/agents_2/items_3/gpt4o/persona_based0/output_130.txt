Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2
0  26   3  84
1  55  73  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuation.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0's valuations: [26, 3, 84]
- Agent 1's valuations: [55, 73, 71]

We need to allocate 3 items in total. A possible envy-free allocation is to prioritize giving each agent the item they value most, if possible. 

Agent 0 values item 2 the most (84), and Agent 1 values item 1 the most (73). If we allocate item 2 to Agent 0 and item 1 to Agent 1, we need to decide who gets item 0.

Agent 0 values item 0 at 26, while Agent 1 values it at 55. Since Agent 1 values item 0 more than Agent 0, we can allocate item 0 to Agent 1. This gives us:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items such that no agent would prefer the other agent's allocation over their own.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
