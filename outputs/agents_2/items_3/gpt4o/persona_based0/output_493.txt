Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2
0  35  71  20
1  72  78  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to examine the valuations provided. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their share as fair according to their valuations. Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 71
  - Item 2: 20

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 72
  - Item 1: 78
  - Item 2: 95

We aim to achieve an allocation where neither agent envies the other. Let's analyze the items:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (95), and it is agent 0's least valued item (20). It's reasonable to allocate item 2 to agent 1 to minimize potential envy.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 at 71, whereas agent 1 values it at 78. Agent 0 values this item the highest among the three, so allocating item 1 to agent 0 prevents envy from agent 0.

3. **Item 0**: This item is valued higher by agent 1 (72) than agent 0 (35). Since agent 1 already gets item 2, which they value the most, we can allocate item 0 to agent 0 to ensure that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation.

By following this allocation, we aim for a division where each agent perceives their allocation as fair without any envy. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
