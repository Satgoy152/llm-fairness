Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

   0   1   2
0  7  42  48
1  8  58  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Here's a breakdown of the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 42
  - Item 2: 48

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 8
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 48

We have 3 items and need to allocate them to 2 agents.

A potentially fair allocation can be determined by ensuring each agent receives the items they value most highly, while ensuring that the overall distribution is as balanced as possible in terms of their perceived value.

One potential allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0 and Item 2.

Let's check the valuations with this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1, valued at 42.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0 and Item 2, valued at 8 + 48 = 56.

In this allocation, both agents receive items, and the overall allocation reflects their valuations fairly well. No agent can receive a higher total value by taking the other agent's items without decreasing the other agent's total value significantly.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
