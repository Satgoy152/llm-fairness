Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2
0  98  37  87
1  24  39  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 98, Item 1 at 37, Item 2 at 87
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 24, Item 1 at 39, Item 2 at 39

We can observe the following:

1. Agent 0 highly values Item 0 and Item 2, significantly more than Agent 1. Therefore, giving Agent 0 these two items would likely maximize their satisfaction.

2. Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest among the three items, and giving Agent 1 this item would likely satisfy them more.

Based on these observations, an allocation that tries to minimize envy is:

- Assign Items 0 and 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that both agents have at least one item and aims to respect their preferences as much as possible given the integer allocation constraint.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation assigns two items to Agent 0 and one item to Agent 1, ensuring that all items are allocated, and attempts to minimize any potential envy between the agents.
