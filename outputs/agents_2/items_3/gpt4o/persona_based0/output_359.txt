Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2
0  71  77  42
1  82  84   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we must first analyze the valuation matrix given:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 71 
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 42

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 82
  - Item 1: 84
  - Item 2: 0

We aim to allocate the 3 items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the distribution is as fair as possible based on their valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for this item (84). Allocating this to Agent 1 maximizes their satisfaction.

2. **Item 0**: Agent 1 also has the highest valuation for this item (82). Allocating this to Agent 1 further increases their satisfaction, but at the same time, Agent 0 also values this item highly (71), and since Agent 1 already received Item 1, it would be reasonable to allocate this to Agent 0 to balance the distribution of total value.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 has a positive valuation (42), whereas Agent 1 values it at 0. Thus, allocating Item 2 to Agent 0 is optimal, as it contributes to Agent 0's satisfaction without causing envy from Agent 1.

With this allocation method, we ensure each agent receives at least one item, and their allocations are as fair and envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
