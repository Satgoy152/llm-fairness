Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2
0  19  46  97
1   2  54  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [19, 46, 97]
Agent 1: [2, 54, 53]
```

We need to allocate the three items (0, 1, 2) between the two agents (0 and 1) such that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 significantly higher (97) than agent 1 (53). To minimize envy, it makes sense to allocate item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 1 higher (54) than agent 0 (46). Thus, item 1 should be allocated to agent 1 to keep the allocation envy-free.

3. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 higher (19) than agent 1 (2). Allocating item 0 to agent 0 maintains envy-freeness.

With this allocation, neither agent envies the other's allocation, as each agent has received the items they value the most.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
