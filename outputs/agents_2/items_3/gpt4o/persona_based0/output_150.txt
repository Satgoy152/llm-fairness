Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2
0  76  76   2
1  94  18  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations, and no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as [76, 76, 2].
- Agent 1 values items as [94, 18, 77].

We need to make sure the allocation is envy-free and each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 1. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 94, while agent 0 values it at 76.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0. Both agents value item 1 at 76 and 18, respectively. This allocation ensures agent 0 gets a high-valued item.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1. Agent 1 values item 2 at 77, which is significant for them, while agent 0 only values it at 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and aims to minimize envy. Agent 0 gets item 1, which they value at 76, and agent 1 gets items 0 and 2, which they value highly.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
