Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2
0  21  62  21
1  61  14  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and attempt to achieve envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer someone else's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   21   |   62   |   21   |
|   1   |   61   |   14   |   44   |

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 21 + 62 + 21 = 104
- Agent 1: 61 + 14 + 44 = 119

Now, let's determine a fair allocation, aiming to balance these valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 62, which is their highest valuation among the items.
   - New valuation for Agent 0: 62 (Item 1)

2. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1:**  
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 61, which is their highest valuation among the items.
   - New valuation for Agent 1: 61 (Item 0)

3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 at 44, and this item is remaining after the first two allocations.
   - New valuation for Agent 1: 61 (Item 0) + 44 (Item 2) = 105

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1 with a valuation of 62.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2 with a combined valuation of 105.

Both agents have received allocations that are consistent with their highest preferences, and each agent has an integer number of items. This allocation should minimize envy since each agent gets their most valued item(s) available.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
