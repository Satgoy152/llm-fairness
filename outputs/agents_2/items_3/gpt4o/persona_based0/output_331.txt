Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2
0  12  90  17
1  39  32   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item and distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: Item 0 = 12, Item 1 = 90, Item 2 = 17
- Agent 1's valuations: Item 0 = 39, Item 1 = 32, Item 2 = 4

Based on these valuations, we can determine an allocation strategy:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this item the highest (90), whereas Agent 1 values it at only 32. Therefore, assigning Item 1 to Agent 0 seems optimal since it maximizes Agent 0's satisfaction while minimizing envy from Agent 1.

2. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this item more (39) compared to Agent 0 (12). Assigning Item 0 to Agent 1 ensures that Agent 1 receives a high-valued item that they prefer.

3. **Item 2**: This item has lower valuations from both agents. However, Agent 0 values it at 17 compared to Agent 1's valuation of 4. Assigning Item 2 to Agent 0 would maximize Agent 0's total valuation while keeping Agent 1's envy in check, as Agent 1 has already received an item they value highly.

With these considerations, the fair and envy-free allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
