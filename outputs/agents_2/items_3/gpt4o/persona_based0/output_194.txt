Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

   0   1   2
0  7  18  51
1  2  17   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that considers envy-freeness, we attempt to allocate items in a way that minimizes the envy between agents. Here, we have two agents (0 and 1) and three items (0, 1, and 2). The goal is to allocate each item to an agent such that each agent gets at least one item, and we distribute all items.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 51

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 2
  - Item 1: 17
  - Item 2: 9

To ensure a fair and envy-free allocation, we can follow these steps to allocate items:

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item the highest (51), and Agent 1 has a lower valuation for it (9).

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 has a high valuation for this item (17), while Agent 0 values it at 18. This allocation minimizes potential envy, considering the previous allocation.

3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item higher (7) than Agent 1 (2).

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they highly value, minimizing envy:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
