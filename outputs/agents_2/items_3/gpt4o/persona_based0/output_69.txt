Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2
0  68  27  82
1  67  60  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we should consider the concept of envy-freeness. This means that each agent should be as satisfied as possible with their own allocation relative to the allocations of the other agents. 

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 68 (item 0) + 27 (item 1) + 82 (item 2) = 177
- Agent 1: 67 (item 0) + 60 (item 1) + 81 (item 2) = 208

Given these valuations, we want to allocate the items such that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they would value the other's allocation.

One possible allocation is:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it the highest at 82.
2. Assign items 0 and 1 to agent 1 because the combined value (67 + 60 = 127) is still higher than agent 0's value for item 2 and it maximizes agent 1's valuation.

This allocation is envy-free because:

- Agent 0 receives item 2 valued at 82, while agent 1's total value for their items is 127. Agent 0 values item 2 higher than any single item agent 1 has.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1, valued at 127. If agent 1 had agent 0's allocation, they would have valued it at 81, which is less than 127.

This allocation is fair because it maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their respective valuations.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
