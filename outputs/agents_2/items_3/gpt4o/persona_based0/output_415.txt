Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2
0  22  79  76
1  89  19  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [89 19 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0:  
  - Item 0: 22  
  - Item 1: 79  
  - Item 2: 76  

- Agent 1:  
  - Item 0: 89  
  - Item 1: 19  
  - Item 2: 16  

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Allocation 1**:  
   - Agent 0 receives items [1, 2], and Agent 1 receives item [0].  
     - Agent 0's value: 79 + 76 = 155  
     - Agent 1's value: 89  
     - Agent 0 prefers their own allocation over Agent 1's allocation, as they receive higher total value.
     - Agent 1 also receives their highest valued item (89).

2. **Allocation 2**:  
   - Agent 0 receives items [0, 1], and Agent 1 receives item [2].  
     - Agent 0's value: 22 + 79 = 101  
     - Agent 1's value: 16  
     - This allocation is less desirable because Agent 1 receives significantly less value, which could lead to envy.

3. **Allocation 3**:  
   - Agent 0 receives items [0, 2], and Agent 1 receives item [1].  
     - Agent 0's value: 22 + 76 = 98  
     - Agent 1's value: 19  
     - Similarly, this allocation does not maximize Agent 1's value.

Among these allocations, Allocation 1 seems to be the fairest. Agent 0 receives two high-valued items, and Agent 1 receives their most valued item, which aligns with their preferences and maximizes their value.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
