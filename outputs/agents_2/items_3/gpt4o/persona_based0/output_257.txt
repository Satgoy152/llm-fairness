Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2
0  30  36  69
1  76  58  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free distribution if possible. Envy-freeness implies that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 30
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 69

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 76
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 84

We need to allocate each item to one agent such that the total number of items allocated is 3. Let's analyze the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0's preferences**: 
   - Highest value for item 2.
   - Second highest for item 1.
   - Least value for item 0.

2. **Agent 1's preferences**:
   - Highest value for item 2.
   - Second highest for item 0.
   - Least value for item 1.

To achieve an allocation that is as fair as possible, we should consider the following allocation strategy:

- **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (69), and Agent 1 also values it highly (84), but if Agent 0 gets item 2, they will not envy Agent 1 if Agent 1 gets their next highest value item.

- **Allocate item 0 to Agent 1**:
  - Agent 1 values item 0 as 76, which is their second highest value. This helps balance the allocation since Agent 0 values item 0 at 30, which is relatively low compared to what Agent 1 values it.

- **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1**:
  - Agent 1 values item 1 at 58, and Agent 0 values it at 36. This way, Agent 1 receives two items they value more than Agent 0 does.

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives their most valued item, and Agent 1 receives two items that, combined, they value highly. This should minimize envy, as Agent 0 gets an item they value significantly, and Agent 1 receives items they value more than Agent 0 does.

The allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
