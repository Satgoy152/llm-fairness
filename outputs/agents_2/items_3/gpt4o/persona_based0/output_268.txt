Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2
0  32  24  33
1  55  14  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that the allocation is envy-free, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their respective valuations while maintaining fairness.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 24
  - Item 2: 33

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 14
  - Item 2: 51

First, we will compute the total valuation each agent would have if they received all items:

- Agent 0 total valuation for all items: 32 + 24 + 33 = 89
- Agent 1 total valuation for all items: 55 + 14 + 51 = 120

Now, let's try to allocate the items to achieve envy-free distribution by maximizing each agent's share according to their preferences:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (55) and item 2 (51), so let's allocate these items to agent 1.
2. Agent 0 will receive item 1, which is the only remaining item.

This allocation ensures:

- Agent 0 gets item 1, which has a value of 24 to them.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2, which have a combined value of 106 to them.

Such allocation minimizes the potential for envy, as each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible given the constraint of having only integer items per agent.

Now, let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
