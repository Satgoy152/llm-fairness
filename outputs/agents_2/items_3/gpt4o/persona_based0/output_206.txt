Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2
0  71  64  80
1  95  46   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method that considers the valuations provided by each agent for each item.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 71 (item 0) + 64 (item 1) + 80 (item 2) = 215
- Agent 1's total valuation: 95 (item 0) + 46 (item 1) + 3 (item 2) = 144

We should aim to divide the items such that both agents feel they are getting a fair share according to their valuations.

One reasonable allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1, because Agent 1 values it the highest.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, because Agent 0 values it the highest.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as this gives Agent 0 a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's the breakdown:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2:
  - Valuation = 64 (item 1) + 80 (item 2) = 144

- Agent 1 receives item 0:
  - Valuation = 95 (item 0)

This allocation ensures each agent is satisfied with their respective shares based on their valuations, as Agent 0 values their items at 144, and Agent 1 values their single item at 95.

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
