Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2
0  87  68  31
1  94  28  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to satisfy the condition of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 87, Item 1 at 68, Item 2 at 31
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 94, Item 1 at 28, Item 2 at 88

We'll consider all possible allocations and select one that is envy-free, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and no agent envies the other's allocation.

### Possible Allocations and Evaluations:

1. **Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [0, 2], Agent 1: [1]
   - Agent 0's total value: 87 (Item 0) + 31 (Item 2) = 118
   - Agent 1's total value: 28 (Item 1) = 28
   - Agent 1 would envy Agent 0 because Agent 1 values Item 0 at 94 and Item 2 at 88, totaling 182.

2. **Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [1, 2], Agent 1: [0]
   - Agent 0's total value: 68 (Item 1) + 31 (Item 2) = 99
   - Agent 1's total value: 94 (Item 0) = 94
   - No envy: Agent 1 does not envy Agent 0 because 94 > 68 (Item 1) + 88 (Item 2).

3. **Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [0], Agent 1: [1, 2]
   - Agent 0's total value: 87 (Item 0) = 87
   - Agent 1's total value: 28 (Item 1) + 88 (Item 2) = 116
   - No envy: Agent 0 prefers Item 0 over Items 1 and 2 combined, and Agent 1 is satisfied with Items 1 and 2.
  
Allocation 3 is a feasible envy-free allocation. Each agent receives at least one item, and neither agent envies the other's allocation based on their valuations.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
