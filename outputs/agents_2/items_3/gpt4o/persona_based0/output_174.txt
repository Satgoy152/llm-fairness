Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2
0   2  22  47
1  92  96  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of the other agent based on their own valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 2  
  - Item 1: 22  
  - Item 2: 47  

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 92  
  - Item 1: 96  
  - Item 2: 45  

We will try to allocate the items so that each agent gets an allocation they find at least as good as the other agent's allocation.

### Potential Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1:**
   - Total value for Agent 1: \(92 + 96 = 188\)
   - Total value for Agent 0: \(2 + 22 = 24\)

2. **Agent 0 receives item 2:**
   - Value for Agent 0: 47
   - Value for Agent 1: 45

This allocation is based on maximizing the total satisfaction or value each agent receives based on their own valuation.

### Verification
- **Agent 0** receives item 2, which they value the highest (47). They don't have any other item to compare, but based on their valuation, it's their preferred item.
- **Agent 1** receives items 0 and 1, valued at 188 in total, which are much higher in their valuation than item 2.

Each agent receives a set of items that they value highly relative to the other agent's potential allocation, which can help in achieving an envy-free or near envy-free allocation, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
