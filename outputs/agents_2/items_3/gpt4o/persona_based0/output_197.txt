Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2
0  67  66  82
1  42  49  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations given by the agents for each of the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels that they received a fair share, given their valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent and item:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 67 
  - Item 1: 66 
  - Item 2: 82

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 42
  - Item 1: 49
  - Item 2: 17

To allocate the items fairly, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent’s total valuation from the items they receive, while ensuring that no agent envies the allocation of the other, given the constraints.

Let’s examine potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0 receives items: [0, 1]**, and **Agent 1 receives item: [2]**.
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 67 (item 0) + 66 (item 1) = 133
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 17 (item 2)

2. **Agent 0 receives items: [2]**, and **Agent 1 receives items: [0, 1]**.
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 82 (item 2)
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 42 (item 0) + 49 (item 1) = 91

For a more balanced allocation, we can consider the scenario where Agent 0 receives the item they value the most, and Agent 1 receives the remaining items that maximize their valuation:

- **Agent 0 receives item: [2]** (valued highest by Agent 0).
- **Agent 1 receives items: [0, 1]** (highest combined valuation for Agent 1).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0: 82 (from item 2)
- Agent 1: 42 (from item 0) + 49 (from item 1) = 91

This allocation is envy-free because neither agent would prefer to switch allocations with the other based on their own valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
