Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2
0  72  98  22
1   7  42  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which means no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Let's analyze the valuations and make an allocation:

**Valuations:**

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 72
  - Item 1: 98
  - Item 2: 22

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 42
  - Item 2: 44

**Total Value for Each Item:**
- Item 0: 72 (Agent 0) + 7 (Agent 1) = 79
- Item 1: 98 (Agent 0) + 42 (Agent 1) = 140
- Item 2: 22 (Agent 0) + 44 (Agent 1) = 66

To achieve an envy-free and fair allocation, we will aim to distribute the items based on the highest individual valuations first.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the most (98).
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 (44 vs. 22).
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it significantly more than Agent 1 (72 vs. 7).

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 and Agent 1 receive items they value highly, reducing potential envy. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
