Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2
0  81  16  94
1  89  70   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In this scenario, we have two agents and three items. The goal is to allocate the items in a way that is fair and minimizes envy. To do this, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 81
  - Item 1: 16
  - Item 2: 94

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 2: 3

We will allocate the items to maximize the sum of values for each agent while trying to minimize envy.

1. For Agent 0, the highest valuation is for Item 2 (94).
2. For Agent 1, the highest valuation is for Item 0 (89).

To complete the allocation, we need to assign the remaining item, which is Item 1. Agent 1 values this item more highly (70) than Agent 0 (16). Thus, we assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 0 and Item 1

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and it attempts to maximize their individual valuations given the constraint of integer allocations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
