Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2
0  73  87  58
1  80  96   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In the context of fair division and envy-freeness, we aim to allocate items to agents in a way that minimizes envy and maximizes fairness. Here, we have two agents and three items, and each agent has a different valuation for each item. Our goal is to allocate the three items to the two agents ensuring that each agent's allocation is as fair as possible.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 73
- Item 1: 87
- Item 2: 58

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 80
- Item 1: 96
- Item 2: 4

One approach to allocate these items is to ensure that each agent gets some items that they value more relatively. We aim to find an allocation that is envy-free, if possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 1**: This is the item with the highest combined valuation by both agents (87 for Agent 0 and 96 for Agent 1). Agent 1 values it more (96 vs. 87), so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 0**: This item has a high valuation by both agents, but Agent 1 values it slightly higher (80 vs. 73). Since Agent 1 already received Item 1, to balance the allocation and reduce envy, we allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: The remaining item has a higher valuation by Agent 0 (58 vs. 4 for Agent 1). We allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 receiving Items 0 and 2
- Agent 1 receiving Item 1

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, aiming for a fair division.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 two items and Agent 1 one item while respecting each agent's valuations and aiming for fairness.
