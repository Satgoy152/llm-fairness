Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2
0  11  78  29
1   8  43   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as any other agent's allocation in terms of their own valuation.

Let's look at the agents' valuations:

- **Agent 0** has valuations:  
  - Item 0: 11  
  - Item 1: 78  
  - Item 2: 29  

- **Agent 1** has valuations:  
  - Item 0: 8  
  - Item 1: 43  
  - Item 2: 1  

A potential approach is to try to maximize each agent's total valuation from their allocated items and check for envy-freeness.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (78).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest as well (43), but significantly less than agent 0.

2. **Allocate Item 1:**
   - Since agent 0 values item 1 much higher than agent 1, it is reasonable to allocate item 1 to agent 0.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - For items 0 and 2, we need to consider remaining valuations.
   - Agent 0 values item 0 next highest (11), whereas agent 1 values item 0 at 8.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 29, whereas agent 1 values it at 1.

4. **Fair Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 1 and item 0 to agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

With this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 0, with a total valuation of 78 + 11 = 89.
- Agent 1 receives item 2, with a valuation of 1.

Agent 0 does not envy agent 1 since 89 > 1, and agent 1 cannot envy agent 0 since agent 0's allocation is clearly better.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2]
}
```
