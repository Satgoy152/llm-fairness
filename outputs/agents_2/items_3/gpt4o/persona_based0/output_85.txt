Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2
0   6  98  97
1  32  59  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [32 59 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents with the goal of minimizing envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives from the items assigned to them.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 6 
  - Item 1: 98 
  - Item 2: 97

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 59
  - Item 2: 53

Based on the valuations, our goal is to maximize the satisfaction for both agents by considering their preferences.

One possible allocation:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 as it gives them the highest value among the items, valued at 98.
- Assign Item 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1. Item 0 is valued at 32 and Item 2 is valued at 53, providing a total value of 85 for Agent 1.

This allocation gives Agent 0 a value of 98 and Agent 1 a total value of 85. Although Agent 0 receives a slightly higher total value, this allocation minimizes envy because each agent receives their most valued item (or close to it, in terms of total value).

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
