Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2
0  65  60   5
1  73  65  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [73 65 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation, while ensuring that the distribution is envy-free, meaning each agent should be at least as satisfied with their allocation as they would be with the other's allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [65, 60, 5]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [73, 65, 36]

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most (73).
2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as both agents value it highly, but distributing it this way balances the valuations.
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0.

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1, valuing it at 60.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2, valuing them at 73 and 36 respectively, for a total value of 109.

This allocation ensures that the items are fairly distributed based on their valuations, and both agents receive at least one item. Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
