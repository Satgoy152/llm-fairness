Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2
0  59  64  83
1  98  15  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as that of any other agent, according to their own valuations.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 64
  - Item 2: 83

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 1: 15
  - Item 2: 94

Let's consider potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0 receives Item 1, Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 64
   - Agent 1's total value: 98 + 94 = 192

2. **Agent 0 receives Item 2, Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 83
   - Agent 1's total value: 98 + 15 = 113

3. **Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1, Agent 1 receives Item 2:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 59 + 64 = 123
   - Agent 1's total value: 94

4. **Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2, Agent 1 receives Item 1:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 59 + 83 = 142
   - Agent 1's total value: 15

5. **Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 2, Agent 1 receives Item 0:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 64 + 83 = 147
   - Agent 1's total value: 98

From these allocations, we aim to achieve a relatively fair distribution. Option 1 balances the allocations by giving the highest possible value to Agent 1, who has a higher valuation for the items, while still giving a reasonable allocation to Agent 0.

Thus, the fair allocation of items to agents is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
