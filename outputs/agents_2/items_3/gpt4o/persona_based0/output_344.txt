Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2
0   1  98   4
1  92  36  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [92 36 32]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents (0 and 1) while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items they value at least as much as they would if they received any other agent's bundle. Given the valuations provided, let's examine the situation:

Agent valuations:
- Agent 0 values: Item 0 = 1, Item 1 = 98, Item 2 = 4
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 = 92, Item 1 = 36, Item 2 = 32

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we will consider the highest value each agent assigns to the items:

1. **Agent 0** highly values Item 1 (98) and has very low valuations for Item 0 (1) and Item 2 (4).
2. **Agent 1** highly values Item 0 (92) but has moderate valuations for Item 1 (36) and Item 2 (32).

Given these valuations, a fair division could be:
- Assign **Item 1** to **Agent 0** because they value it the most.
- Assign **Items 0 and 2** to **Agent 1** because they value Item 0 highly and Item 2 moderately.

This allocation should satisfy envy-freeness:
- Agent 0 receives Item 1, which they value the most.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2, which combined provide them significant value.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
