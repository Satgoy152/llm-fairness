Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2
0  28  80   8
1  26  87  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as any other allocation given the agents' valuations. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **List the valuations:**

   - Agent 0 values: Item 0 (28), Item 1 (80), Item 2 (8)
   - Agent 1 values: Item 0 (26), Item 1 (87), Item 2 (66)

2. **Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:**

   - Agent 0 total valuation: 28 + 80 + 8 = 116
   - Agent 1 total valuation: 26 + 87 + 66 = 179

3. **Determine the allocation:**

   We want to allocate items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. One common approach is to allocate items to ensure envy-freeness by matching the highest-valued items to the respective agents when possible.

   - Agent 0 highly values Item 1 (80).
   - Agent 1 highly values Item 1 (87) but values Item 2 significantly as well (66).

   A possible allocation to minimize envy while giving each agent a fair share could be:
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (since it's their highest valued item).
   - Assign Items 0 and 2 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values Item 2 highly and has a higher overall valuation).

   This gives Agent 0 their highest valued item and Agent 1 their second-highest and a less desired item, balancing the allocations based on perceived value.

4. **Check allocations:**

   - Agent 0 has Item 1, valued at 80 for them.
   - Agent 1 has Items 0 and 2, valued at 26 + 66 = 92 for them.

   Both agents have a total perceived value of at least 80, which is close given the disparity in total valuations.

5. **JSON allocation output:**

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation is designed to achieve a sense of fairness and envy-freeness given the constraints and the valuations provided.
