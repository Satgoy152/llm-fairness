Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2
0  79  85  92
1  74  76  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or minimizing envy. One common approach is to assign items in a way that aims to equalize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocation, given their individual valuations of the items.

Let's first look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 92

- Agent 1 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 74
  - Item 1: 76
  - Item 2: 73

One possible fair allocation is to assign items such that both agents have as close as possible total value from their allocated items. Let's consider the following allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

This provides the following valuations:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1 and Item 2:
  - Total valuation = 85 (Item 1) + 92 (Item 2) = 177

- Agent 1 receives Item 0:
  - Total valuation = 74 (Item 0)

While Agent 0 receives a higher total valuation, this allocation cannot be further improved to minimize envy without exceeding the available items, given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
