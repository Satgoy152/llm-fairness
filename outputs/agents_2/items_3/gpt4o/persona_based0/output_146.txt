Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2
0  26  21  37
1  82   3   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the items to the agents in a way that is fair and envy-free, if possible, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Valuation Matrix:**
   - Agent 0 values: Item 0 = 26, Item 1 = 21, Item 2 = 37
   - Agent 1 values: Item 0 = 82, Item 1 = 3, Item 2 = 0

2. **Total Valuation per Agent:**
   - Total valuation for Agent 0 = 26 + 21 + 37 = 84
   - Total valuation for Agent 1 = 82 + 3 + 0 = 85

3. **Preference Analysis:**
   - Agent 0 prefers Item 2 the most, followed by Item 0 and then Item 1.
   - Agent 1 prefers Item 0 the most, followed by Item 1 and then Item 2.

4. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Allocate items starting from the most valued item by each agent, ensuring no envy and efficient allocation.

5. **Allocation:**
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 because it's their highest valued item.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 because it's their highest valued item.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 1 has very low value for Item 1.

The allocation results in:
- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures both agents receive at least one item, and it is based on their preferences, making it a fair distribution given the constraints.
