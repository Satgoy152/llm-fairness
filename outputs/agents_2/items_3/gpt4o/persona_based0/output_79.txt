Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2
0  42  71  91
1  19  93  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that each agent should not prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 42, Item 1 at 71, Item 2 at 91
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 19, Item 1 at 93, Item 2 at 63

We can calculate the total value each agent assigns to each possible allocation of items:

1. Allocation (Agent 0: [0, 1], Agent 1: [2])
   - Agent 0's value: 42 + 71 = 113
   - Agent 1's value: 63

2. Allocation (Agent 0: [0, 2], Agent 1: [1])
   - Agent 0's value: 42 + 91 = 133
   - Agent 1's value: 93

3. Allocation (Agent 0: [1, 2], Agent 1: [0])
   - Agent 0's value: 71 + 91 = 162
   - Agent 1's value: 19

4. Allocation (Agent 0: [0], Agent 1: [1, 2])
   - Agent 0's value: 42
   - Agent 1's value: 93 + 63 = 156

5. Allocation (Agent 0: [1], Agent 1: [0, 2])
   - Agent 0's value: 71
   - Agent 1's value: 19 + 63 = 82

6. Allocation (Agent 0: [2], Agent 1: [0, 1])
   - Agent 0's value: 91
   - Agent 1's value: 19 + 93 = 112

By examining these allocations, we look for one that minimizes envy. Allocation 4 (Agent 0: [0], Agent 1: [1, 2]) seems to be a reasonable choice because:

- Agent 0 receives item 0 with a value of 42.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2 with a total value of 156.

In this allocation:

- Agent 0 values their allocation at 42 and might compare it with Agent 1's allocation. However, Agent 0 values items 1 and 2 together at 162, which is a higher value than 156. Thus, there is some envy, but it's minimized compared to other allocations.

- Agent 1 values their allocation at 156 and would value item 0 alone at 19, which is less than 42. Therefore, Agent 1 has no envy for Agent 0's allocation.

Given these considerations, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
