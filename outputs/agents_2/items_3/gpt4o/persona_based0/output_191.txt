Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0  1   2
0  91  3  17
1  76  4  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is as fair as possible. A common fairness measure is envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [91, 3, 17]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [76, 4, 13]

We want to allocate the items {0, 1, 2} to agents {0, 1}.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Start with the highest value items**: Allocate each item to the agent that values it the most.
2. **Evaluate envy**: Check if this allocation results in envy for any agent.
3. **Adjust if necessary**: Reallocate to minimize envy.

**Step 1: Initial Allocation Based on Maximum Valuation**

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 91, and Agent 1 values it at 76. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 3, and Agent 1 values it at 4. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 17, and Agent 1 values it at 13. Allocate to Agent 0.

**Initial Allocation:**
- Agent 0: Items {0, 2}
- Agent 1: Item {1}

**Step 2: Evaluate Envy**

- Agent 0's total valuation: 91 (Item 0) + 17 (Item 2) = 108
- Agent 1's total valuation: 4 (Item 1)

Agent 1 may feel envious because Agent 0's total valuation is significantly higher due to having items 0 and 2, which are valued highly by Agent 0.

**Step 3: Adjust Allocation to Minimize Envy**

To minimize envy, we can consider swapping or reallocating items:

- Swap Item 2 from Agent 0 to Agent 1:
  - Agent 0: Item {0}
  - Agent 1: Items {1, 2}

**Evaluate New Allocation:**
- Agent 0's total valuation: 91 (Item 0)
- Agent 1's total valuation: 4 (Item 1) + 13 (Item 2) = 17

This allocation reduces envy since now Agent 1 has a higher total valuation for their items. However, Agent 0 may still feel envious, but the allocation is more balanced in terms of maximizing each agent's highest valuations.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
