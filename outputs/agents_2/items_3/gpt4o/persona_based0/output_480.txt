Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2
0  35  19  36
1  83  20   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation and ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2
0  35  19  36
1  83  20   1
```

An approach to achieve a fair allocation is to try to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent from the items they receive, ensuring that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 35.
   - Agent 1 values it at 83.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 for maximum valuation.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 19.
   - Agent 1 values it at 20.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 for maximum valuation.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 36.
   - Agent 1 values it at 1.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 for maximum valuation.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their respective valuations while ensuring that both agents receive at least one item, and all items are allocated.

### Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the item they value most highly (out of the remaining unallocated items), and Agent 1 receives the items which they value more than Agent 0 does. This ensures that both agents receive a fair share according to their valuations.
