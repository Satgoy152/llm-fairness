Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2
0   7  92  54
1  94  43  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 43 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, which aims to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is challenging given the small number of items and the varying valuations.

Hereâ€™s the valuation table for reference:

```
Agent\Item |  0  |  1  |  2
-----------|-----|-----|----
    0      |  7  | 92  | 54
    1      | 94  | 43  | 85
```

### Steps to Allocate Fairly:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value for item 1 (92).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value for item 0 (94).

3. **Remaining Item:**
   - Item 2 is left, valued at 54 by Agent 0 and 85 by Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 has a higher valuation for item 2 than Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent is getting the item they value the most that is available to them, considering their highest preferences.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
