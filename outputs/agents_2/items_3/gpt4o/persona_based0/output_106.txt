Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2
0  78  89  75
1  73  44  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 75

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 73
  - Item 1: 44
  - Item 2: 99

Let's evaluate different item combinations and their valuations for both agents to ensure a fair distribution.

Agent 0's total valuation:
- Item 0 + Item 1 = 78 + 89 = 167
- Item 0 + Item 2 = 78 + 75 = 153
- Item 1 + Item 2 = 89 + 75 = 164

Agent 1's total valuation:
- Item 0 + Item 1 = 73 + 44 = 117
- Item 0 + Item 2 = 73 + 99 = 172
- Item 1 + Item 2 = 44 + 99 = 143

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent's combined valuation for their assigned items is reasonably balanced.

One possible allocation is:
- Assign Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

Valuations under this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, with a total valuation of 167.
- Agent 1 receives item 2, with a total valuation of 99.

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 gets the higher combined valuation, while Agent 1 gets their most valued item, ensuring a sense of fairness.

JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
