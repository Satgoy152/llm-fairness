Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2
0  14  40  53
1  93  91  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as the bundle received by any other agent.

### Agents' Valuations:
- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: 14
  - Item 1: 40
  - Item 2: 53

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 93
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 12

### Approach:
1. **Agent 1** has very high valuations for items 0 and 1 compared to Agent 0, while Agent 0 values item 2 more than Agent 1.
2. To minimize envy, we should consider allocating items such that each agent receives their most valued items first.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 1** should get items 0 and 1 because they have significantly higher valuations for these items compared to Agent 0.
- **Agent 0** should get item 2 since it is their most valued item, and Agent 1 values it the least.

This allocation minimizes envy because:
- Agent 0 receives their most valued item (item 2), which they value at 53.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1, which are their top two valued items.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
