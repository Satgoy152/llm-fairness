Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2
0  53  26  66
1  50  91  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to find a distribution where neither agent envies the other. This typically involves ensuring that each agent receives the bundle of items that they value the most.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 0: 53, Item 1: 26, Item 2: 66
- Agent 1: Item 0: 50, Item 1: 91, Item 2: 61

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 53 + 26 + 66 = 145
- Agent 1's total valuation: 50 + 91 + 61 = 202

Now, let's consider different allocations to minimize envy:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, Item 1 to Agent 1, and Item 2 to Agent 0:**

   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of 53 + 66 = 119.
   - Agent 1 receives item 1, with a valuation of 91.

   In this allocation, neither agent envies the other, as each receives a bundle they perceive as most valuable given the constraints of the problem.

2. **Verify if there are other potential allocations:**

   - Allocating Item 1 to Agent 1 is optimal because they value it highly (91).
   - Allocating items 0 and 2 to Agent 0 maximizes their valuation without exceeding the total allocation of items.

Hence, the allocation where Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, and Agent 1 receives item 1, is a fair division based on the valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
