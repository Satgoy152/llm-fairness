Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2
0   2  71  81
1  11  22  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we need to allocate all items such that each agent values their own bundle at least as much as any other bundle, considering that we have integer allocations and each agent receives at least one item.

Let's first list the items and agents:

- Items: 0, 1, 2
- Agents: 0, 1

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as [2, 71, 81]
- Agent 1 values items as [11, 22, 42]

Envy-freeness with integer allocations is challenging, but we can aim for a fair allocation based on maximizing the total valuation while giving each agent at least one item.

### Possible Allocation Strategy:

- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item more than Agent 0 (11 vs. 2).
  
- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item much more than Agent 1 (71 vs. 22).

- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item more than Agent 1 (81 vs. 42).

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 gets two high-value items according to their own valuations, which should help minimize envy. Agent 1 receives the item they value more than Agent 0 does.

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their own valuations.
