Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2
0  58   9   4
1  61  25  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between agents 0 and 1, we should aim to follow the principles of fair division, specifically targeting envy-freeness if possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their own valuation of the items.

Let's evaluate the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations:  
  - Item 0: 58  
  - Item 1: 9  
  - Item 2: 4  
  - Total: 58 + 9 + 4 = 71

- Agent 1's valuations:  
  - Item 0: 61  
  - Item 1: 25  
  - Item 2: 13  
  - Total: 61 + 25 + 13 = 99

To achieve envy-freeness, we should try to balance the value each agent receives according to their own valuations.

1. **Assign Item 0**:  
   - This item is highly valued by both agents. However, it's slightly more valued by agent 1 (61 vs 58).  
   - Giving this high-value item to agent 1 might help balance the overall allocation.

2. **Assign Item 1**:  
   - Agent 0 values this item at 9, while agent 1 values it more at 25.  
   - Giving this to agent 1 would add to their total valuation.

3. **Assign Item 2**:  
   - This item is valued at 4 by agent 0 and at 13 by agent 1.  
   - Giving this to agent 0 could help balance the allocation more evenly.

Let’s evaluate this allocation:

- **Agent 0 receives:** Item 2 (value 4)  
- **Agent 1 receives:** Item 0 (value 61), Item 1 (value 25)  

**Agent 0's total value:** 4  
**Agent 1's total value:** 61 + 25 = 86  

This allocation gives a fair division with a focus on minimizing envy, as each agent receives items based on their valuations in a way that limits the preference for the other agent’s allocation.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
