Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2
0  81  89  46
1   3  43  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on each item. Our goal is to allocate the items in such a manner that neither agent envies the other's allocation based on their subjective valuations.

Here is the valuation table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 81     | 89     | 46     |
| 1     | 3      | 43     | 55     |

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should aim to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation relative to the other agent's allocation.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest (89), then Item 0 (81), and lastly Item 2 (46).
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest (55), then Item 1 (43), and lastly Item 0 (3).

To distribute the items fairly:

- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as it holds the highest value for them and is also a high-value item for Agent 1, which might help balance total perceived value.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, as it is their second-highest-valued item, and Agent 1 values it the least.

This allocation maximizes the total perceived value for each agent without creating envy.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, and Agent 1 receives item 2. This allocation should help maintain fairness and avoid envy based on their valuations.
