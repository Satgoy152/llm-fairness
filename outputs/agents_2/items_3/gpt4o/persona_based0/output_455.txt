Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2
0  45  13  58
1  80  45  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible given the constraints. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. 

Here are the valuations from the table:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 45, Item 1 at 13, Item 2 at 58
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 80, Item 1 at 45, Item 2 at 79

First, let's sum the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 45 + 13 + 58 = 116
- Agent 1: 80 + 45 + 79 = 204

Given these valuations, let's try to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy. One approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations for each agent.

1. **Allocate Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 45
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 80
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1

2. **Allocate Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 13
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 at 45
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1

3. **Allocate Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 58
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 at 79
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0

This allocation results in the following:

- Agent 0 receives Item 2, with a valuation of 58.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1, with a total valuation of 80 + 45 = 125.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and it attempts to minimize envy by prioritizing higher valuations where possible. Agent 1 receives the two items they value more, and Agent 0 receives the item they value the most.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
