Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2
0  31  25  79
1  78  32  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to reduce envy by ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly. This method prioritizes envy-freeness over maximizing total value or efficiency.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 25
  - Item 2: 79

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 32
  - Item 2: 10

A potential allocation that considers envy-freeness could be:

- Agent 0 receives item 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.

This allocation can be justified as follows:

1. **Agent 0** receives item 2, which they value the highest (79). This allocation minimizes potential envy from Agent 0 because it gives them their most valued item.

2. **Agent 1** receives items 0 and 1, which have a combined value of 110 (78 + 32), maximizing their total value and reducing envy since this is the best achievable total value for Agent 1 given the constraints.

This allocation ensures both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations, and it is likely to be envy-free under these circumstances.

Final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
