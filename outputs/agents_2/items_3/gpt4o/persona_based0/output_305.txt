Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2
0  87  37  59
1  57  41   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their utility given the constraints.

The given valuations are:

- Agent 0: Item 0 = 87, Item 1 = 37, Item 2 = 59
- Agent 1: Item 0 = 57, Item 1 = 41, Item 2 = 8

One approach is to allocate items such that the difference in total value received by each agent is minimized, which helps in achieving envy-freeness.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Total valuation for all items: 87 + 37 + 59 = 183
   - The highest-valued item for Agent 0 is Item 0 (87).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Total valuation for all items: 57 + 41 + 8 = 106
   - The highest-valued item for Agent 1 is Item 1 (41).

Given these preferences, we can start by allocating the highest-valued item to each agent:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

Now, we need to allocate Item 2:

- If Agent 0 receives Item 2, their total value becomes 87 + 59 = 146.
- If Agent 1 receives Item 2, their total value becomes 41 + 8 = 49.

To minimize the envy and create a more balanced allocation:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as this allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 146 and Agent 1 a total value of 41, which minimizes the envy given the constraints.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
