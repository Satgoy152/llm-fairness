Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2
0  97  45  42
1  86  99  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, if possible. 

The agents' valuations for the items are as follows:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 1: 45
  - Item 2: 42

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 86
  - Item 1: 99
  - Item 2: 36

The goal is to allocate the 3 items in such a way that each agent is satisfied with their allocation compared to the other agent's allocation, minimizing envy if possible.

1. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item the most (99) compared to Agent 0 (45). Thus, it makes sense for Agent 1 to receive Item 1.

2. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item the most (97) compared to Agent 1 (86). Therefore, Agent 0 should receive Item 0.

3. **Item 2**: Both agents have a relatively lower valuation for this item. However, Agent 0 has a higher valuation (42) than Agent 1 (36). Thus, it is reasonable for Agent 0 to receive Item 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, given the constraints, and minimizes envy between the agents.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
