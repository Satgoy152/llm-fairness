Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0  1   2
0  31  7  93
1  85  3  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness is achieved when each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's in terms of their own valuation. 

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (31), Item 1 (7), Item 2 (93)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (85), Item 1 (3), Item 2 (68)

A possible fair division strategy is to give each agent the item they value the most, if possible, or try to balance the total valuation they receive.

Let's examine their highest valuations:
- Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (93)
- Agent 1 values Item 0 the most (85)

Given these valuations, a fair allocation could be:
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1

Now we have one item left, Item 1, which Agent 0 values at 7 and Agent 1 values at 3. To maintain fairness, we can allocate this item to Agent 0 since Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0: Total valuation = 93 (Item 2) + 7 (Item 1) = 100
- Agent 1: Total valuation = 85 (Item 0)

This allocation is envy-free because:
- Agent 0 values their allocation (Items 2 and 1) at 100, which is greater than the value they assign to Agent 1's allocation (Item 0) at 31.
- Agent 1 values their allocation (Item 0) at 85, which is greater than the value they assign to Agent 0's allocation (Items 2 and 1) at 71.

Thus, the final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
