Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2
0  66  83  32
1  77  61  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's perceived value of their allocated items. Envy-freeness is achieved when no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, given their individual valuations.

Let's examine the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 1: 83
  - Item 2: 32

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 77
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 23

A straightforward approach to achieve fairness is to assign items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is maximized for their respective allocation. Let's consider possible allocations:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 and Items 0 and 2 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 1 with a value of 83.
   - Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2 with values of 77 + 23 = 100.

2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 and Items 1 and 2 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 0 with a value of 66.
   - Agent 1 gets Items 1 and 2 with values of 61 + 23 = 84.

3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 and Items 0 and 1 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 2 with a value of 32.
   - Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 1 with values of 77 + 61 = 138.

Option 1 provides a more balanced allocation in terms of how much each agent values their allocation compared to option 3, where Agent 1 would have a significantly higher total value. Therefore, option 1 is likely to be perceived as more fair and envy-free.

Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
