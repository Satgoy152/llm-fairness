Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2
0  77  32  49
1  15  38  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items while considering the valuations of each agent, we can explore different allocation methods. A common approach is to aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  |
|------------|----|----|----|
| 0          | 77 | 32 | 49 |
| 1          | 15 | 38 | 77 |

Let's consider each agent's highest-valued item, which could be a starting point for a fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (77) and secondarily item 2 (49).
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most (77) and secondarily item 1 (38).

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it is their highest-valued item.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.

This leaves item 1, which can be allocated to either agent. To maintain fairness, let's consider total valuations:

- If Agent 0 receives item 1 in addition to item 0, their total valuation is 77 + 32 = 109.
- If Agent 1 receives item 1 in addition to item 2, their total valuation is 77 + 38 = 115.

Since Agent 0 will have a higher total valuation if they receive item 1, we allocate item 1 to Agent 0 to minimize disparity:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.

This allocation aims to be fair and minimizes envy based on the given valuations. Now, I'll present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
