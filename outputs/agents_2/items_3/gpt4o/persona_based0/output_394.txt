Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2
0  30  66  77
1  57  79  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the other agent's allocation. In this scenario, we have two agents (0 and 1) and three items (0, 1, and 2). The goal is to allocate all three items such that each agent gets an integer number of items and the allocation is as fair as possible.

Let's outline the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: Item 0 = 30, Item 1 = 66, Item 2 = 77
- Agent 1's valuations: Item 0 = 57, Item 1 = 79, Item 2 = 72

We will try to allocate the items to maximize fairness:

1. Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest (77), and Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (79).
2. If Agent 0 receives Item 2, and Agent 1 receives Item 1, we need to allocate Item 0 to one of them.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Item 2
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1

Now, calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 77 (Item 2)
- Agent 1's total valuation: 57 (Item 0) + 79 (Item 1) = 136

While this allocation might not be perfectly envy-free, it balances the distribution based on the highest valued items each prefers. In this case, Agent 1 receives more value, but Agent 0 gets the item they value the most.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
