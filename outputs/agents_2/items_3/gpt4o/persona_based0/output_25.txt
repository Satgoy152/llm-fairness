Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2
0  84  78  68
1  70  83  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents (0 and 1), we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own.

Let's first look at the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 84
  - Item 1: 78
  - Item 2: 68

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 70
  - Item 1: 83
  - Item 2: 59

A simple way to allocate items fairly is to ensure each agent receives items that they highly value while considering each other's preferences. We will proceed by trying to maximize each agent's total valuation based on the constraints.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 84, and Agent 1 values it at 70.
   - It is more beneficial for Agent 0 to receive Item 0 due to the higher valuation.

2. **Allocate Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 78, and Agent 1 values it at 83.
   - It is more beneficial for Agent 1 to receive Item 1 due to the higher valuation.

3. **Allocate Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 68, and Agent 1 values it at 59.
   - It is more beneficial for Agent 0 to receive Item 2 due to the higher valuation.

By following this allocation, both agents receive items they highly value, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, and Agent 1 receives item 1. This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value most, given the constraints, and attempts to minimize envy between the agents.
