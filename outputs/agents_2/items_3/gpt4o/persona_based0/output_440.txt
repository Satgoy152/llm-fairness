Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2
0  57  81  72
1  24  93  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate the items in a way that either maximizes the total valuation or ensures each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences.

Here's a summary of the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0 at 57
  - Item 1 at 81
  - Item 2 at 72

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 24
  - Item 1 at 93
  - Item 2 at 60

Let's consider the total value each agent places on the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 57 + 81 + 72 = 210
- Agent 1's total valuation: 24 + 93 + 60 = 177

Given these valuations, a fair allocation strategy is to distribute the items so that each agent gets a bundle of items that they value highly relative to their overall valuation.

We will attempt to allocate items to maximize the perceived fairness from both agents' perspectives.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest at 93, which is significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation of 81 for the same item.
2. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 2 at 72, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 60.
3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: This leaves Item 0, which Agent 0 values higher than Agent 1 (57 vs. 24).

This allocation results in the following distribution:
- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of 57 + 72 = 129.
- Agent 1 receives Item 1, with a valuation of 93.

This allocation ensures both agents receive items they value highly, and the allocation is envy-free since each agent receives a bundle they value at least as much as the other agent's bundle.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
