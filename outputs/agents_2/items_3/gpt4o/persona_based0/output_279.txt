Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2
0  20  36  64
1  33   3  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, meaning each agent should feel that they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's start by examining the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 20
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 64

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 69

Now, let's consider possible allocations and their implications:

1. **Allocation 1:**
   - Agent 0 receives items: [0, 1]
   - Agent 1 receives item: [2]

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0's total value: 20 + 36 = 56
   - Agent 1's total value: 69

   This allocation results in no envy as Agent 0's highest valued item is item 2, which Agent 1 receives, and Agent 1 receives their highest valued item.

2. **Allocation 2:**
   - Agent 0 receives item: [2]
   - Agent 1 receives items: [0, 1]

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0's total value: 64
   - Agent 1's total value: 33 + 3 = 36

   This allocation is also envy-free since Agent 0 receives their highest valued item, and Agent 1 receives both remaining items, maximizing their total value.

Either allocation is fair and envy-free. We will choose the first allocation for simplicity.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
