Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2
0  19  36  76
1  39  46  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 76

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 39
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 23

To find an envy-free allocation, we should consider the total valuations each agent assigns to each potential allocation. 

Let's consider the following allocation approach:

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 76.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 23.

2. **Allocate Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 and item 1 at 19 and 36, respectively, totaling 55.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 and item 1 at 39 and 46, respectively, totaling 85.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their total individual valuations:

- Agent 0 receives Item 2, which they value the highest.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0 and Item 1, which together maximize their valuation compared to any other combination.

This allocation appears envy-free since:

- Agent 0 receives their most valued item.
- Agent 1 receives the combination of items that provide them the highest total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent has an integer number of items.
