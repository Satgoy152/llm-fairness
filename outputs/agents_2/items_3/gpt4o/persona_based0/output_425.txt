Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2
0  70  40  14
1   5   0  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5  0 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations for the items and aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 70
  - Item 1 at 40
  - Item 2 at 14

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 5
  - Item 1 at 0
  - Item 2 at 83

To achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 very highly (83) compared to Agent 0 (14). Allocating this item to Agent 1 minimizes envy.

2. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 the highest (70), while Agent 1 values it at only 5. Giving this item to Agent 0 satisfies their higher valuation.

3. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 40, while Agent 1 has no value for it (0). Allocating this item to Agent 0 ensures Agent 0 receives a fair share according to their valuations.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1 receives Item 2

This allocation is envy-free as neither agent would prefer to switch their allocation with the other based on their personal valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
