Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2
0  95  39  86
1  36  57  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we start by analyzing the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 39
  - Item 2: 86

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 57
  - Item 2: 37

Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels their share is fair, ideally avoiding envy. One way to aim for envy-freeness is to maximize each agent's valuation for the items they receive.

Here's a step-by-step allocation analysis:

1. **Agent 0** values Item 0 the most (95), followed by Item 2 (86). 
2. **Agent 1** values Item 1 the most (57), followed by Item 2 (37).

To ensure a fair allocation, let's consider the following allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (high valuation for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for Agent 1).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (second highest valuation for Agent 0).

This results in:

- Agent 0 receiving Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receiving Item 1.

This allocation is chosen because it maximizes the total utility for each agent given their preferences, while also ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
