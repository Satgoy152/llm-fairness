Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2
0  23  96  56
1  58  76  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents such that the division is envy-free or as close to it as possible, we can examine the valuation table provided:

```
    0   1   2
0  23  96  56
1  58  76  65
```

Agent 0's valuations: 
- Item 0: 23
- Item 1: 96
- Item 2: 56

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 58
- Item 1: 76
- Item 2: 65

A common approach to achieve fairness and minimize envy is to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them items they value highly while balancing the distribution as much as possible.

One possible allocation strategy:
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 because they value it the highest (96).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 because they value it more than Agent 0 does (58 vs. 23).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 because they value it more than Agent 0 does (65 vs. 56).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. 

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
