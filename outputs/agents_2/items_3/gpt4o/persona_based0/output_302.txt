Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2
0  22  94  58
1  42  70  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of any other agent, according to their own valuations.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 22 (item 0) + 94 (item 1) + 58 (item 2) = 174
- Agent 1: 42 (item 0) + 70 (item 1) + 73 (item 2) = 185

Now, we will try to allocate items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation:

1. Consider the highest valued items for each agent. Agent 0 values item 1 the most (94), and agent 1 values item 2 the most (73).

2. To balance satisfaction, we can give agent 0 their highest valued item (item 1) and give agent 1 their highest valued item (item 2).

3. For the remaining item (item 0), we note that agent 0 values it at 22 and agent 1 values it at 42. To minimize envy, we assign item 0 to agent 1, as it has a higher relative value for them.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives item 1, with a total valuation of 94.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2, with a combined valuation of 115 (42+73).

This allocation is fair in the sense that each agent receives their highest-valued item(s) without exceeding the other agentâ€™s total valuation for their allocated items.

Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
