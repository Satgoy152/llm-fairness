Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2
0  72  49  93
1  16  58  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [16 58 19]]
Output:
To ensure a fair division of items between the two agents, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is as fair as possible given their valuations.

Let's examine the valuation table:

```
Agent\Item |  0   1   2
----------------------
    0      | 72  49  93
    1      | 16  58  19
```

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we will attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items.

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**
   - Item 0: 72
   - Item 1: 49
   - Item 2: 93

2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**
   - Item 0: 16
   - Item 1: 58
   - Item 2: 19

**Strategy:**
- Prioritize assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

**Allocation:**
- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 72, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 16. So, assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 58, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 49. So, assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 93, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 19. So, assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items maximizing their total value, given their preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
