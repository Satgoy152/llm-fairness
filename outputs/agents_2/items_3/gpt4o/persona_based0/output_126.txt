Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2
0  82  51  18
1  72   4  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a way that is fair and envy-free, we consider each agent's valuation of the items. We aim to assign the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 82
  - Item 1: 51
  - Item 2: 18

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 72
  - Item 1: 4
  - Item 2: 55

To achieve fairness, we will use the concept of maximizing the total value received by each agent based on their own valuation.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Assign Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 the highest (82 vs. 72 for Agent 1). Therefore, assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Assign Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 51, while Agent 1 values it at only 4. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Assign Item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 higher (55 vs. 18 for Agent 0). Therefore, assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2.

This allocation respects the agents' valuations and aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
