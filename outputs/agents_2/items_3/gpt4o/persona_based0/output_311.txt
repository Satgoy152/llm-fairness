Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2
0  77  53  77
1  49  88  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should feel that their allocated items provide them with at least as much value as the items allocated to the other agent.

Let's analyze the situation:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 77
- Item 1: 53
- Item 2: 77

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 49
- Item 1: 88
- Item 2: 71

One potential approach is to maximize the satisfaction of the agents by ensuring the allocation is as balanced as possible according to their valuations. 

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Item 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 1 (88), which is significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation (53). Hence, allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 0**: Both agents value Item 0, with Agent 0 valuing it at 77 and Agent 1 at 49. Agent 0 has a higher valuation, so allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: Both agents value Item 2 highly, but Agent 0 values it slightly more (77) than Agent 1 (71). However, to balance the allocation and ensure fairness, we examine the overall value each agent will receive. 

   Allocating Item 2 to Agent 1 would balance the total value each agent perceives from their allocation.

### Calculated Allocations

Let's calculate the total perceived value for each agent with this allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets Item 0:
  - Total value = 77

- **Agent 1** gets Items 1 and 2:
  - Total value = 88 (Item 1) + 71 (Item 2) = 159

This allocation is not envy-free because Agent 0 may feel that Agent 1's allocation is better. Therefore, let's reconsider and swap Item 2:

- **Agent 0** gets Items 0 and 2:
  - Total value = 77 (Item 0) + 77 (Item 2) = 154

- **Agent 1** gets Item 1:
  - Total value = 88

This allocation is more balanced, as each agent receives high-value items according to their valuations, and neither agent can strictly prefer the other's allocation based on their own valuation.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
