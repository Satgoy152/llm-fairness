Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2
0  28  27  94
1  62  34   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent values theirs. We'll aim to distribute the items so that the perceived value for each agent is balanced.

First, let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 28
  - Item 1: 27
  - Item 2: 94
  - Total value: 28 + 27 + 94 = 149

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 62
  - Item 1: 34
  - Item 2: 6
  - Total value: 62 + 34 + 6 = 102

Given these valuations, we seek a fair allocation. Let's proceed by considering possible allocations that balance the total perceived value:

1. If we allocate items based on their highest value to any agent, we have:
   - Item 0: Highest value to Agent 1 (62 vs. 28)
   - Item 1: Highest value to Agent 1 (34 vs. 27)
   - Item 2: Highest value to Agent 0 (94 vs. 6)

This results in:
- Agent 0 receives item 2
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1

Valuations under this allocation:
- Agent 0: Value of item 2 = 94
- Agent 1: Value of items 0 + 1 = 62 + 34 = 96

The allocation is reasonably balanced in terms of total values perceived by each agent, with no agent having a significant reason to envy the other.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
