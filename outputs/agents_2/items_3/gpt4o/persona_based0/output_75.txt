Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2
0   6  73  57
1  25  59   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent values their allocation as fairly as possible. Here's a breakdown of the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 6
  - Item 1: 73
  - Item 2: 57

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 25
  - Item 1: 59
  - Item 2: 4

A potential fair allocation would consider giving each agent items that maximize their utility without causing significant envy. One approach is to assign items based on the highest relative value to each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

### Fair Allocation

1. **Agent 0** values Item 1 the most (73) and significantly more than Agent 1 (59).
2. **Agent 1** values Item 0 the most (25) compared to Agent 0 (6).
3. **Item 2** is valued more by Agent 0 (57) than by Agent 1 (4).

Given these observations, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly, minimizing potential envy.

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2, which they value highly, and Agent 1 receives item 0, which they value the most and more than Agent 0 does. This distribution aims to achieve a fair and envy-free outcome based on the given valuations.
