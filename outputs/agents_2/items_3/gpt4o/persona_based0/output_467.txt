Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2
0  65  30  72
1  40  95  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider concepts like maximizing total value and ensuring that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 65, Item 1 at 30, Item 2 at 72
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 40, Item 1 at 95, Item 2 at 21

A potential strategy is to allocate items to maximize the total perceived value by each agent as much as possible, while also considering fairness and avoiding envy.

### Steps to consider:

1. **Identify the highest value for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest (72).
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (95).

2. **Allocate the highest valued items:**
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate the remaining item:**
   - The remaining item is Item 0. Agent 0 values it at 65, and Agent 1 values it at 40.
   - It should be allocated to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it more highly.

Given these considerations, the allocation that maximizes overall satisfaction while maintaining fairness is:

- Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets Item 1.

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, balancing the overall satisfaction and fairness.
