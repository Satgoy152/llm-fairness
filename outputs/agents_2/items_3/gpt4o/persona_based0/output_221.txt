Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2
0  94   3  66
1  73  17  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while focusing on envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the other agent's allocation. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0 at 94
  - Item 1 at 3
  - Item 2 at 66

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 73
  - Item 1 at 17
  - Item 2 at 26

A possible way to allocate the items to satisfy these constraints is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that no agent envies the allocation of the other. 

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Assign Item 0 (valued highest by Agent 0) to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 (valued relatively high by Agent 1) to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1, which is valued least by both, to Agent 1.

This would result in the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0, valued at 94.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2, with total valuation 17 + 26 = 43.

Checking for envy-freeness:

- Agent 0 values their allocation (94) higher than the combined value of Agent 1’s allocation (3 + 66 = 69).
- Agent 1 values their allocation (43) higher than Agent 0’s single item (73).

Although Agent 1’s valuation is lower, they have more items, and given the possible allocations, no completely envy-free allocation is possible if agents value items significantly differently. Nevertheless, this allocation minimizes envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
