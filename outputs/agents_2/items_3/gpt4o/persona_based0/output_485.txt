Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2
0  57  50  16
1  59  74   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly and ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to maximize their satisfaction.

Let's examine the valuations:

- **Agent 0** values: 
  - Item 0 at 57
  - Item 1 at 50
  - Item 2 at 16

- **Agent 1** values:
  - Item 0 at 59
  - Item 1 at 74
  - Item 2 at 1

To achieve envy-freeness, we want to allocate items in a way that each agent values their bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values this the highest at 74. 
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 57, which is high for them.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Neither agent highly values Item 2, but Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

With this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 1.

### Verification:
- **Agent 0**'s total value: 57 (Item 0) + 16 (Item 2) = 73
- **Agent 1**'s total value: 74 (Item 1)

Both agents have some allocation they value highly, and it's the best possible scenario given the constraints.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
