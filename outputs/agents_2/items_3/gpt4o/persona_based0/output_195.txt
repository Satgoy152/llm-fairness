Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2
0  99  28  32
1  32  37  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible, given that each agent should receive an integer number of items. This is a small problem, so we can manually evaluate the possible allocations.

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 28
  - Item 2: 32

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 37
  - Item 2: 76

We are looking for an allocation that considers these valuations to minimize envy or distribute the perceived value as evenly as possible. 

Let's consider the following allocation options:

1. **Allocate items based on highest preference:**
   - Agent 0 gets Item 0 (valued at 99 for Agent 0)
   - Agent 1 gets Item 2 (valued at 76 for Agent 1)
   - Now, Item 1 remains, which should go to the agent with the lesser total value.
   - Agent 1 will get Item 1 (valued at 37 for Agent 1)

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 total value: 99
- Agent 1 total value: 113 (37 + 76)

This allocation seems fair as agent 1 has more total value but each agent gets their most valued item.

Allocate items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
