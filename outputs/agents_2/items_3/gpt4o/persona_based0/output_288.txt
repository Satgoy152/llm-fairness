Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2
0   2  80  74
1  93  65  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. 

Here is the valuation table for clarity:

```
          Items
       0   1   2
Agents
  0    2  80  74
  1   93  65  62
```

Let's examine the values more closely:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 0 at 2, item 1 at 80, and item 2 at 74.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 0 at 93, item 1 at 65, and item 2 at 62.

A potential allocation strategy aiming for envy-freeness is as follows:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 (80) and item 2 (74) compared to item 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (93) compared to items 1 and 2.

Allocate based on maximizing each agent's total perceived value, while keeping the distribution fair:

- **Agent 0** is allocated items 1 and 2.
- **Agent 1** is allocated item 0.

This allocation gives:

- **Agent 0**: Total value = 80 (item 1) + 74 (item 2) = 154
- **Agent 1**: Total value = 93 (item 0)

Such an allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value most, leading to a fair and envy-free distribution given the constraints.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
