Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2
0  31  19  67
1  37  12  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 19
  - Item 2: 67

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 37
  - Item 1: 12
  - Item 2: 47

To achieve a fair allocation, we should try to ensure that each agent receives items in a manner that reflects their preferences and minimizes envy.

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for Item 2 (67). Assigning Item 2 to Agent 0 will maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1** values Item 0 the highest (37) compared to other items. Assigning Item 0 to Agent 1 will maximize their satisfaction.
3. **Item 1** can be allocated to either agent. However, Agent 0 values Item 1 slightly higher than Agent 1 (19 vs. 12). Assigning Item 1 to Agent 0 will balance the allocation and minimize overall envy.

Thus, the allocation will be as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.

Allocating this way ensures that both agents receive items based on their highest valuations and minimizes potential envy.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
