Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2
0  29  89  58
1  73  69  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the items such that the allocation is envy-free or as envy-free as possible given the discrete nature of the problem. We have the valuations of each agent for each item as follows:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 29
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 58

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 73
  - Item 1: 69
  - Item 2: 32

One simple method to achieve a fair allocation is to use a "greedy" approach, where each item is given to the agent who values it the most. This can help minimize envy, although it may not completely eliminate it.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 29
   - Agent 1 values it at 73
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 89
   - Agent 1 values it at 69
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 58
   - Agent 1 values it at 32
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2, and Agent 1 receives item 0. This allocation may not be perfectly envy-free, but it minimizes envy given the discrete allocation constraint.
