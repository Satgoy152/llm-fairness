Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2
0  25  45  22
1  47  56  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we first need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation given their preferences.

Here's a breakdown of the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations:
  - Item 0: 25
  - Item 1: 45
  - Item 2: 22

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 47
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 2: 72

A potential approach is to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents by considering their highest valued items.

1. Agent 1 values item 2 the most (72), which is significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation for the same item (22). Therefore, it is reasonable to allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

2. After allocating item 2 to Agent 1, we consider the remaining items. Agent 1's next highest valuation is for item 1 (56), while Agent 0 values item 1 (45). To ensure fairness, we can allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 has a higher valuation for it.

3. With item 2 and item 1 allocated to Agent 1, item 0 is left. Agent 0 values item 0 at 25, whereas Agent 1 values it at 47. Since Agent 0 has not received any items yet, it's fair to allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

Now, we ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent gets their fair share based on their valuations and preferences.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
