Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2
0  10  29  10
1  60  18  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [60 18 26]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim for an envy-free allocation where possible. 

Let's look at the valuations for each item:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 1: 29
  - Item 2: 10

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 60
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 26

The goal is to allocate all 3 items between the two agents in a way that minimizes envy. One common approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that the allocation remains envy-free if possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values this item at 10.
   - Agent 1 values this item at 60.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it significantly higher.

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Agent 0 values this item at 29.
   - Agent 1 values this item at 18.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it higher.

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 0 values this item at 10.
   - Agent 1 values this item at 26.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it higher.

### Final Allocation:

Based on this analysis, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0 gets Item 1.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2.

This distribution aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives, considering their preferences, and minimizes envy.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
