Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2
0  65  78  73
1  80  35   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items while considering envy-freeness, we first examine each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to allocate items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 65
  - Item 1 at 78
  - Item 2 at 73

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 80
  - Item 1 at 35
  - Item 2 at 8

From these valuations, we can see that:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 1 (78) and then Item 2 (73).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 0 (80).

To ensure a fair allocation:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it the most and Agent 0 values it less than the other items.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it the most.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it highly, and Agent 1 values it the least.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, minimizing potential envy.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
