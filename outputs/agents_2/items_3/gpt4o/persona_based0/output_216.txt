Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2
0  63   7  48
1  25  59  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to ensure that neither agent envies the other, based on their respective valuations. The goal is to maximize the perceived value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 63, Item 1 at 7, Item 2 at 48.
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 25, Item 1 at 59, Item 2 at 48.

Let's consider possible allocations:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 and Items 1 and 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0 gets Item 0 valued at 63.
   - Agent 1 gets Items 1 and 2 valued at 59 + 48 = 107.

2. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 and Items 1 and 2 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 1 gets Item 0 valued at 25.
   - Agent 0 gets Items 1 and 2 valued at 7 + 48 = 55.

3. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 and Items 0 and 2 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 1 gets Item 1 valued at 59.
   - Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 2 valued at 63 + 48 = 111.

4. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 and Items 0 and 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0 gets Item 1 valued at 7.
   - Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2 valued at 25 + 48 = 73.

The most envy-free and fair allocation, considering the best perceived value for each agent and their respective valuations, would be:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, Items 1 and 2 to Agent 1.

In this scenario, Agent 0 gets a high value from their perspective (63), and Agent 1 also gets high value (107). Neither agent significantly envies the other based on their highest valued items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
