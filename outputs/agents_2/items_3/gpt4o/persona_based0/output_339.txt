Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2
0  86  11  72
1  75  57  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve a distribution that is envy-free, or at least minimizes envy, given the existing valuations. Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 86
  - Item 1 at 11
  - Item 2 at 72
  
- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 75
  - Item 1 at 57
  - Item 2 at 37

The goal is to allocate the items such that neither agent envies the other based on their own valuations as much as possible. 

Let's assess the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0** gets items 0 and 2, **Agent 1** gets item 1:
   - Agent 0 values: 86 (item 0) + 72 (item 2) = 158
   - Agent 1 values: 57 (item 1) 

2. **Agent 0** gets item 0, **Agent 1** gets items 1 and 2:
   - Agent 0 values: 86 (item 0)
   - Agent 1 values: 57 (item 1) + 37 (item 2) = 94

3. **Agent 0** gets items 1 and 2, **Agent 1** gets item 0:
   - Agent 0 values: 11 (item 1) + 72 (item 2) = 83
   - Agent 1 values: 75 (item 0)

4. **Agent 0** gets item 1, **Agent 1** gets items 0 and 2:
   - Agent 0 values: 11 (item 1)
   - Agent 1 values: 75 (item 0) + 37 (item 2) = 112

Considering minimizing envy, allocation 2 seems reasonable as it balances the total valuations better than others:

- Agent 0 gets item 0, valued at 86.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2, valued together at 94.

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to reduce the perceived envy between the agents based on their valuations.
