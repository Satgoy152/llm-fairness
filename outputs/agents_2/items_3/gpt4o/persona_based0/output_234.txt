Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2
0  78  94  16
1  58  65  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item. We aim to allocate the items such that neither agent feels that another agent has received a more valuable allocation. 

Let's examine the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 94
  - Item 2: 16

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 1: 65
  - Item 2: 66

We can use the following approach to achieve a fair distribution:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest (94), and this will make Agent 0 feel satisfied.
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest (66), which will make Agent 1 feel satisfied.
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values Item 0 higher (78) than Agent 1 does (58).

Checking the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives: Item 0 and Item 1 (valuations: 78 + 94 = 172)
- Agent 1 receives: Item 2 (valuation: 66)

This allocation is envy-free because neither agent would prefer to swap their allocation with the other:

- Agent 0 is satisfied with the higher total valuation of their items (172) compared to what Agent 1 receives (66).
- Agent 1 receives their most valued item, Item 2.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
