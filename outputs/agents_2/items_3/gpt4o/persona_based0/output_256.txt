Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2
0  74  79   2
1   0  50  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is both efficient (Pareto optimal) and envy-free as much as possible given the constraints. With only three items and two agents, the primary goal is to maximize the total utility while ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 74
  - Item 1: 79
  - Item 2: 2

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 0
  - Item 1: 50
  - Item 2: 74

Now, let's consider the potential allocations:

1. **Allocation 1**:  
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
   - Agent 1: Item [2]
   - Agent 0's total value: 74 + 79 = 153
   - Agent 1's total value: 74

2. **Allocation 2**:  
   - Agent 0: Item [1]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 2]
   - Agent 0's total value: 79
   - Agent 1's total value: 0 + 74 = 74

3. **Allocation 3**:  
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
   - Agent 1: Item [1]
   - Agent 0's total value: 74 + 2 = 76
   - Agent 1's total value: 50

Among these options, Allocation 1 provides the highest total value for Agent 0, which might lead to some envy if Agent 1 perceives the allocation as unfair. However, it guarantees that both agents receive items they value highly.

Given the constraints and the need to allocate all items, Allocation 1 appears to be a reasonable choice. There might be some envy from Agent 1 due to the larger total valuation received by Agent 0, but with these limited options and the need for integer allocations, this division maximizes the utility for both agents.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
