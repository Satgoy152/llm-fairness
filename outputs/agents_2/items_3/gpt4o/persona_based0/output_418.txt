Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2
0  91  30  36
1  98  63  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and integer allocation, we need to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations.

The given valuations are:

```
Agent 0: Item 0 -> 91, Item 1 -> 30, Item 2 -> 36
Agent 1: Item 0 -> 98, Item 1 -> 63, Item 2 -> 11
```

One simple approach to achieve a fair allocation is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 values it at 98. Agent 1 values it more.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 30, Agent 1 values it at 63. Agent 1 values it more.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 values it at 11. Agent 0 values it more.

Based on this analysis, the allocation that maximizes satisfaction is:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and it is done in such a way as to minimize envy, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
