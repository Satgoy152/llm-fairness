Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2
0  86  44  95
1  73  78  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where each agent feels that they have received the best possible items given their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:  
  - Item 0: 86  
  - Item 1: 44  
  - Item 2: 95  

- Agent 1 values:  
  - Item 0: 73  
  - Item 1: 78  
  - Item 2: 56  

We can try to find an allocation that maximizes the utility for each agent given their valuations.

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for Agent 0 are Item 2 (95) and Item 0 (86).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value items for Agent 1 are Item 1 (78) and Item 0 (73).

To allocate items fairly, let's distribute the items in a way that considers each agent's top preferences while ensuring that both agents get at least one item:

- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (since it is most valued by Agent 0 and less valued by Agent 1).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (since it is most valued by Agent 1 and less valued by Agent 0).
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1).

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items they value the most (86 + 95 = 181 total value), and Agent 1 gets the item they value the most (78 total value), leading to a fair distribution based on their preferences.
