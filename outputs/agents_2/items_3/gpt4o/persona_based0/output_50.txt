Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2
0  27  24  46
1  99  52  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider concepts of fairness such as envy-freeness or maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. In this case, since there are 3 items and 2 agents, each agent should receive an integer number of items, meaning one agent will receive 2 items and the other will receive 1 item.

Let's evaluate the agents' preferences:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [27, 24, 46]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [99, 52, 84]

The goal is to allocate the items such that the overall value each agent receives is maximized given the constraints.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 27 + 24 + 46 = 97
   - Agent 1: 99 + 52 + 84 = 235

2. Identify the highest individual valuations:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 99.

3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as this is the highest value for any single item for Agent 1. This would likely reduce envy.

4. For the remaining items (1 and 2), compare the valuations:
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 values it at 52.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 46, Agent 1 values it at 84.

5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because it maximizes their value. Now Agent 1 has items 0 and 2.

6. Allocate the remaining item (item 1) to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation maximizes the total value each agent receives given the constraints and aims to minimize envy.
