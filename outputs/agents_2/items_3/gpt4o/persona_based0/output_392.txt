Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2
0  14  46   6
1  44  59  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free if possible. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Let's look at the valuation matrix:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  |
|------------|----|----|----|
| 0          | 14 | 46 | 6  |
| 1          | 44 | 59 | 97 |

We need to allocate the three items (0, 1, 2) to the two agents (0, 1). Here's a potential process:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 at 97, while agent 0 values it at 6. Allocating item 2 to agent 1 maximizes their satisfaction significantly.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 at 59, and agent 0 values it at 46. While agent 1 has a higher valuation, allocating item 1 to agent 0 balances the total value distribution.

3. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 at 44, and agent 0 values it at 14. Allocating item 0 to agent 1 maximizes their total valuation.

Let's summarize it:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly three. The envy-freeness is maximized by making sure each agent gets a high-value item according to their preferences.

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
