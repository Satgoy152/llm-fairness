Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1  2
0  20  90  9
1  18  87  0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents using the concept of envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that no agent prefers the allocation of the other agent over their own. Given the valuations, we need to consider how each agent values each item to make a decision.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 20
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 9

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 1: 87
  - Item 2: 0

Let's consider the potential allocations:

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: This is the highest valued item for both agents, but Agent 0 values it slightly more than Agent 1 (90 vs. 87). Giving this item to Agent 0 can make them less envious of Agent 1 if they get other items.

2. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: While both agents value this item similarly, Agent 1's valuation is slightly lower (18 vs. 20), but giving Agent 0 the highest valued item (Item 1) allows Agent 1 to receive Item 0 without causing significant envy.

3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 2 more than Agent 1 (9 vs. 0), so it makes sense to give this item to Agent 0.

By following this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2, which they value at 99 (90 + 9).
- Agent 1 receives item 0, which they value at 18.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and their allocations are aligned with their preferences, minimizing envy.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
