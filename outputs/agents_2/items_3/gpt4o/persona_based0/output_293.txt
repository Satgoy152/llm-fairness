Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2
0  71   0   7
1  26  96  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 96 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible based on the given valuations.

Here's the valuation matrix:

| Agent/Item | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Agent 0    | 71     | 0      | 7      |
| Agent 1    | 26     | 96     | 63     |

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 71, while Agent 1 values it at 26.
   - Allocating Item 0 to Agent 0 seems fairer as they value it significantly higher.

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 0, while Agent 1 values it at 96.
   - Allocating Item 1 to Agent 1 is clearly fair as Agent 1 values it highly, and Agent 0 places no value on it.

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 7, while Agent 1 values it at 63.
   - Allocating Item 2 to Agent 1 seems appropriate as they value it higher.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value the most, minimizing envy. Agent 0 gets Item 0, which is most valuable to them, and Agent 1 gets Items 1 and 2, which they value highly.

**Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
