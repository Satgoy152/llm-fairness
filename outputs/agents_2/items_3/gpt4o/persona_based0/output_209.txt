Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2
0  83  81  45
1  16  89  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to examine the valuations given by each agent for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own, or at least minimize the envy.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2
0  83  81  45
1  16  89  55
```

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 83
  - Item 1: 81
  - Item 2: 45

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 16
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 55

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can consider allocating the items based on the highest valuations for each item, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values this item the highest (83), compared to Agent 1 (16).
2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values this item the highest (89), compared to Agent 0 (81).
3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values this item higher (55) than Agent 0 (45), and since Agent 1 has only one item allocated so far, this allocation is reasonable. 

This allocation strategy attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0 with a valuation of 83.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2 with a combined valuation of 89 + 55 = 144.

This allocation minimizes envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
