Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2
0  10  11  65
1  73  66   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to minimize envy by making sure each agent gets the most valued items possible, given the constraints.

Let's examine the valuations each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 1: 11
  - Item 2: 65

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 73
  - Item 1: 66
  - Item 2: 3

A fair division approach is to allocate items such that each agent gets the items they value the most, while also ensuring that each agent ends up with a similar level of satisfaction, given their own valuation function.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. **Agent 1** highly values Item 0 (73) and Item 1 (66) compared to Agent 0. Therefore, to satisfy Agent 1, we should allocate both Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 0** highly values Item 2 (65), much more than Agent 1 does. Thus, we allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value the most, given the constraints of integer allocations and the need to assign all items.

Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
