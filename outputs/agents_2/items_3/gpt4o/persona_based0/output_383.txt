Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2
0  24  76  23
1  78  55  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

```
   Item
      0   1   2
A0  24  76  23
A1  78  55  96
```

Let's analyze the preferences:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 24
  - Item 1 at 76
  - Item 2 at 23

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 78
  - Item 1 at 55
  - Item 2 at 96

**Proposed Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0**: Given Agent 0's highest value is for Item 1 (76), this item should be allocated to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Given that Agent 1 values Item 2 the most (96), this item should be allocated to Agent 1.
3. **Remaining Item**: Item 0 is left. Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 (78 vs. 24), so it should be allocated to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that both agents are receiving items they highly value, reducing potential envy. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This distribution ensures each agent gets their preferred items according to their values, and all items are distributed.
