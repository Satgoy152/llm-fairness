Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2
0  89  56   3
1  27  38  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we first need to understand each agent's valuation of each item. Based on the given table:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 89
  - Item 1 at 56
  - Item 2 at 3

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 27
  - Item 1 at 38
  - Item 2 at 31

The goal is to allocate all three items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. A common approach to achieve fairness is to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while minimizing envy.

Let's consider the allocation:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0. This item has the highest value for Agent 0.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1. This item is more valuable to Agent 1 than Item 2.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1. Although Agent 1 gets the lower valued Item 2, they still receive a higher total valuation than if they received only Item 1.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Item 0 with a value of 89.
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2 with values of 38 and 31, respectively, totaling 69.

Agent 0's total valuation is 89, and Agent 1's total valuation is 69. This allocation minimizes envy since each agent receives items based on their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
