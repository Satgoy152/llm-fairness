Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2
0  74  12  85
1  60  98  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items in a way that minimizes envy, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize their satisfaction with their allocated items. 

Analyzing the table:

- Agent 0's valuations: Item 0 (74), Item 1 (12), Item 2 (85).
- Agent 1's valuations: Item 0 (60), Item 1 (98), Item 2 (51).

To achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

One possible approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Let's evaluate the best allocation:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for Agent 0 (85).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for Agent 1 (98).
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it more highly than Agent 1 (74 vs. 60).

Now, each agent has received items based on their preferences and the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 1.

This allocation minimizes envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
