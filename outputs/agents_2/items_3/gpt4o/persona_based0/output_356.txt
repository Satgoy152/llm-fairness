Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2
0  93   1  75
1  21  25  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we consider the valuations that each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that is fair, meaning no agent should envy another agent's allocation.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 93
  - Item 1: 1
  - Item 2: 75

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 21
  - Item 1: 25
  - Item 2: 77

One common approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent given their preferences.

Let's analyze a possible allocation:

1. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 gets a valuation of 93.
   - Agent 1 would get a valuation of 21 for this item if they had it, which is less than 93.

2. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 gets a valuation of 25.
   - Agent 0 would get a valuation of 1 for this item if they had it, which is less than 25.

3. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 gets a valuation of 77.
   - Agent 0 would get a valuation of 75 for this item if they had it, which is slightly less than 77.

Now, let's check if this allocation is envy-free:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0, which they value the most (93), and sees Agent 1 with Items 1 and 2 (valuations 1 and 75), totaling 76. Therefore, Agent 0 does not envy Agent 1.

- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2, totaling a valuation of 102 (25 + 77). They see Agent 0 with Item 0, valued at 21 by Agent 1, which is less than their own total valuation of 102. Therefore, Agent 1 does not envy Agent 0.

The allocation is thus fair and envy-free. Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
