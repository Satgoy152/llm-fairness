Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2
0  56  88  76
1  80  18  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 56
  - Item 1 at 88
  - Item 2 at 76

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 80
  - Item 1 at 18
  - Item 2 at 13

To achieve a fair division, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that neither agent envies the other, given their valuations.

We proceed as follows:

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest at 88, which is significantly higher than Agent 1's valuation of 18.

2. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 0 the highest at 80, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 56.

3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 2 at 76, which is significantly higher than Agent 1's valuation of 13.

After these allocations:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 2, with a total valuation of 88 + 76 = 164.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0, with a valuation of 80.

This allocation appears fair given the valuations because:

- Agent 0 receives items they value highly (164 in total).
- Agent 1 receives the item they value highest (80).

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
