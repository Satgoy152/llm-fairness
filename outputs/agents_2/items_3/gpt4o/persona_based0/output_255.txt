Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2
0  65  30   6
1  92  81  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we can consider the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 65
  - Item 1: 30
  - Item 2: 6

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 92
  - Item 1: 81
  - Item 2: 83

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the following steps:

1. Assign the items based on maximizing the total value for each agent without creating envy.

Let's analyze the values:

- For Item 0, Agent 1 values it higher (92 vs. 65).
- For Item 1, Agent 1 values it higher (81 vs. 30).
- For Item 2, Agent 1 values it higher (83 vs. 6).

Since Agent 1 values all items higher than Agent 0, we can start by assigning items to Agent 1 until Agent 0 can get a fair share without envy.

A potential allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 gets Item 1.
- Agent 1 gets Item 0 and Item 2.

Let's verify the allocations to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1 with value 30.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0 and Item 2 with a combined value of 175 (92 + 83).

Although Agent 1 has a higher total value than Agent 0, Agent 0 receives the item they value highest among the remaining after Agent 1 gets their most valued item.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
