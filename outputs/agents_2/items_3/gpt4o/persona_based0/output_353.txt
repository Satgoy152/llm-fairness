Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2
0  75  28  42
1   9  55  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division while considering envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair relative to their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2
0  75  28  42
1   9  55  14
```

Agent 0's valuations for items 0, 1, and 2 are 75, 28, and 42, respectively.  
Agent 1's valuations for items 0, 1, and 2 are 9, 55, and 14, respectively.

To determine a fair allocation, we can use the following approach:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation for them (75 vs. 9 for Agent 1).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as it has the highest valuation for them (55 vs. 28 for Agent 0).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as it has a higher valuation for them (42 vs. 14 for Agent 1).

This allocation results in the following:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, with total valuation: 75 + 42 = 117.
- Agent 1 receives item 1, with total valuation: 55.

This allocation ensures that neither agent feels envious of the other because each agent receives at least as much value as they perceive in the other's allocation.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
