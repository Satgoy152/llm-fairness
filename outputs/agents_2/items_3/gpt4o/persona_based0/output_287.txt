Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2
0  84  14   4
1  13   4  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to achieve an allocation that is envy-free, meaning each agent should receive a bundle of items that they value at least as much as any other agent's bundle.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 84
  - Item 1: 14
  - Item 2: 4

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 13
  - Item 1: 4
  - Item 2: 13

We need to allocate all three items between the two agents. A straightforward approach is to initially explore which agent values each item more:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 values it at 13. Agent 0 values this item more.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 values it at 4. Agent 0 values this item more.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 4, Agent 1 values it at 13. Agent 1 values this item more.

An allocation that could potentially be envy-free is:

- Assign Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for these items.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for this item.

With this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, for a total valuation of \(84 + 14 = 98\).
- Agent 1 receives item 2, for a valuation of 13.

Agent 0 may not be envious of Agent 1 because they receive a higher total valuation. Agent 1, while having fewer items, is not envious because they receive the item they value most highly.

Here is the resulting allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
