Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2
0  95  16  80
1  95  85  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1) while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 16
  - Item 2: 80

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 86

We aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

Here's the breakdown:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0, which they value at 95.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2, which they value at 85 and 86, respectively.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Total valuation = 95
- Agent 1: Total valuation = 85 + 86 = 171

While Agent 1 receives more in terms of total valuation, Agent 0 gets their highest valued item, which could be considered a fair trade-off. This allocation minimizes envy, as neither agent can strictly prefer the other's allocation given their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
