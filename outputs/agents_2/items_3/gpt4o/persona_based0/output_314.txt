Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1  2
0  20  99  0
1  66  29  8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent feels envious of the other. This typically means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as the other's allocation.

Let's first summarize the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 20 (Item 0) + 99 (Item 1) + 0 (Item 2) = 119
- Agent 1's total valuation: 66 (Item 0) + 29 (Item 1) + 8 (Item 2) = 103

For an envy-free allocation, we want to try and match the perceived value each agent receives as closely as possible.

Agent 0 has a particularly high valuation for item 1, but Agent 1 has a significant valuation for item 0. We need to balance these preferences:

1. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0. This is their highest-valued item.
2. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1. This is their highest-valued item.
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1. This has a low valuation for both, but it slightly increases Agent 1's total valuation.

After this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1, valued at 99.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0 and Item 2, valued at 66 + 8 = 74.

This allocation balances each agent's total perceived value as closely as possible. Agent 0 receives more value in one item, while Agent 1 balances this with two items.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
