Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2
0  56  68  84
1  60  81  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1) based on their valuations, one approach is to minimize envy, which means ensuring that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value the other agent's allocation. We can achieve this by examining the valuations provided and attempting to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here are the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 56
  - Item 1: 68
  - Item 2: 84

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 60
  - Item 1: 81
  - Item 2: 55

To minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an allocation they value, we can proceed with the following allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 84.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 81.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 1. This minimizes envy as Agent 1 values item 0 more than Agent 0 values item 0.

This allocation results in the following total values for each agent:

- Agent 0: 84 (from item 2)
- Agent 1: 141 (from items 0 and 1)

While the total valuations are not equal, this allocation minimizes envy since each agent receives at least one of their highest-valued items and maximizes their utility given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
