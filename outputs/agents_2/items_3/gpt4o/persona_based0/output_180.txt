Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2
0  87  36  87
1  27  45  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [27 45 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider their valuations for each item and aim for an envy-free distribution, if possible. Envy-freeness implies that each agent should receive a bundle of items such that they do not prefer the other agent's bundle over their own.

Here's the given valuation table for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 87     | 36     | 87     |
| 1     | 27     | 45     | 37     |

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Evaluate Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 values items 0 and 2 the highest (both at 87).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (at 45).

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as it's the item they value the most.
   - Allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 0, as they value these items the highest (87 each).

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of 174.
   - Agent 1 receives item 1, with a valuation of 45.
   - Both agents receive their most valued items, and neither agent would prefer to swap their allocation with the other considering their own valuations.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation respects the given constraints and aims to be as fair as possible given the valuations.
