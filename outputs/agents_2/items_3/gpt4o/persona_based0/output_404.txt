Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2
0  12  39  62
1  28  93  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [28 93 66]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, meaning that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the table:

```
Items
    0   1   2
0  12  39  62
1  28  93  66
```

Here are the steps to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Evaluate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 12 (Item 0) + 39 (Item 1) + 62 (Item 2) = 113
   - Agent 1: 28 (Item 0) + 93 (Item 1) + 66 (Item 2) = 187

2. **Aim for Envy-Free Allocations:**
   - Start by considering which item is most valuable to each agent.
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the most, with a value of 62.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the most, with a value of 93.

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Maximum Valuation:**
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

4. **Allocate Remaining Item (Item 0):**
   - Remaining item is Item 0.
   - Compare how much each agent values Item 0:
     - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 12.
     - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 28.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it more.

5. **Check for Envy-Freeness:**
   - Agent 0 receives Item 2 (value 62).
   - Agent 1 receives Item 1 and Item 0 (value 93 + 28 = 121).
   - Neither agent would prefer the other's allocation given their valuations.

Therefore, the fair allocation of items that achieves envy-freeness is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
