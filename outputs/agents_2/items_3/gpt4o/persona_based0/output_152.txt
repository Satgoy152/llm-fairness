Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2
0  25   4  14
1  16  20  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy, we first need to analyze the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their individual valuations.

The table of valuations is as follows:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 25     | 4      | 14     |
| 1     | 16     | 20     | 23     |

Let's examine a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values Item 0 the most (25), followed by Item 2 (14), and Item 1 the least (4).
- Agent 1 values Item 2 the most (23), followed by Item 1 (20), and Item 0 the least (16).

A strategy to achieve envy-freeness is to allocate items based on the highest value each agent places on them, ensuring the allocation is fair and balanced.

### Possible Allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 since it is their highest-valued item.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 since it is their highest-valued item.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as it is their second-highest value and Agent 0 values it the least.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, optimizing for envy-freeness. Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
