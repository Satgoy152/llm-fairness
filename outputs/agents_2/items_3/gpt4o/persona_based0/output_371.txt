Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2
0  63  12  61
1  24  37  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy. Envy-freeness is achieved when each agent feels they have received the best possible allocation given the circumstances, or at least as good as any other agent's allocation in their view.

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 63
  - Item 1: 12
  - Item 2: 61

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 24
  - Item 1: 37
  - Item 2: 71

### Total Valuation per Agent:
- **Agent 0:** 63 + 12 + 61 = 136
- **Agent 1:** 24 + 37 + 71 = 132

### Allocation Approach:
The goal is to allocate items in a way that each agent feels content with their allocation compared to the other agent's allocation. An allocation is considered envy-free if each agent values their own bundle at least as much as the bundle of the other agent.

Considering the valuations, let's try to find an envy-free allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0:**
   - This item has a high value for Agent 0 (63) compared to Agent 1 (24).

2. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:**
   - This item has a high value for Agent 1 (71) compared to Agent 0 (61).

3. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1:**
   - This item is relatively more valuable for Agent 1 (37) compared to Agent 0 (12).

### Valuation Check:
- **Agent 0's bundle:** Item 0
  - Total value = 63

- **Agent 1's bundle:** Items 1 and 2
  - Total value = 37 + 71 = 108

Under this allocation:
- Agent 0 values their bundle at 63.
- Agent 1 values their bundle at 108.

Agent 0 cannot get more value than 63 from the items because the other valuable item (Item 2) is with Agent 1. Agent 1's bundle is worth 108, and although the total value is more than 63, Agent 1 does not envy Agent 0 since they have a higher total valuation.

Given these considerations, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
