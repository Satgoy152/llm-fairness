Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2
0  70  42  55
1  85  36  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In the context of fair division, we often aim to reach an allocation that is envy-free, or at least as fair as possible given the constraints. Here, we have 2 agents and 3 items, and we want to allocate all items so that each agent gets an integer number of items. We can evaluate allocations based on the agents' valuations of the items to achieve a fair distribution.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 70
  - Item 1: 42
  - Item 2: 55
  
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 85
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 65

A straightforward approach is to maximize the total utility for both agents while trying to ensure fairness.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 the highest at 85.
   
2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 higher than Agent 1 does (42 vs 36).
   
3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 55, which is less than Agent 1's valuation (65), but since Agent 1 already received Item 0 (which is highly valued by them), it balances the allocation.

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived fairness by giving each agent items that they value relatively high compared to the other agent. It also respects the rule that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

**Final Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
