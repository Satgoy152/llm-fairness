Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2
0  77  67  77
1  98  27  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items based on the given valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can consider the concept of maximizing the total utility for each agent or minimizing envy between the agents.

Here's the matrix of valuations provided:

```
      Item 0  Item 1  Item 2
Agent 0   77     67     77
Agent 1   98     27     36
```

A fair allocation should aim to distribute the items such that neither agent feels significantly disadvantaged. One common approach is to first allocate the item that each agent values the most. Let's assess the valuations:

- Agent 0 values Item 0 and Item 2 equally the highest at 77.
- Agent 1 values Item 0 the highest at 98.

Given this, let's aim to allocate items such that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, while also considering an overall fair distribution:

1. Give Item 0 to Agent 1, since it's valued highest by Agent 1 (98), and also highly by Agent 0 (77). This ensures that Agent 1 receives the item they value the most.
2. Give Item 2 to Agent 0, as it's one of the highest valued items for Agent 0 (77).
3. Finally, give Item 1 to Agent 0 because:
   - It balances the total number of items (2 for Agent 0, 1 for Agent 1).
   - Agent 0 values it at 67, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 27.

This allocation is reasonably fair, given that Agent 1 receives the item they value the most, and Agent 0 receives two items they value quite highly. The allocations thus are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
