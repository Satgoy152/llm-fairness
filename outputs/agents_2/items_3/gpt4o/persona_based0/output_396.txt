Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2
0  37  71  36
1  67  94  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly, we aim to ensure an envy-free distribution if possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Let's first examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 37
  - Item 1 at 71
  - Item 2 at 36

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 67
  - Item 1 at 94
  - Item 2 at 35

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 3 items are distributed.

### Possible Allocations:

1. **Allocation 1**:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 2
   - Agent 1: Item 1

   **Valuations for Allocation 1**:
   - Agent 0: 37 (Item 0) + 36 (Item 2) = 73
   - Agent 1: 94 (Item 1)

   **Envy Check**: 
   - Agent 0 values their allocation at 73 and agent 1's allocation at 67 (Item 0) + 35 (Item 2) = 102. Agent 0 would envy agent 1.
   - Agent 1 values their allocation at 94 and agent 0's allocation at 71 (Item 1) + 35 (Item 2) = 106. Agent 1 would envy agent 0.

2. **Allocation 2**:
   - Agent 0: Item 1
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 2

   **Valuations for Allocation 2**:
   - Agent 0: 71 (Item 1)
   - Agent 1: 67 (Item 0) + 35 (Item 2) = 102

   **Envy Check**:
   - Agent 0 values their allocation at 71 and agent 1's allocation at 37 (Item 0) + 36 (Item 2) = 73. Agent 0 does not envy agent 1.
   - Agent 1 values their allocation at 102 and agent 0's allocation at 94 (Item 1). Agent 1 does not envy agent 0.
   
### Conclusion:

The second allocation is both envy-free and fair, as no agent envies the allocation of the other agent. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
