Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2
0  10  17  77
1  50  95  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that is envy-free (if possible) among the two agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items and ensure that each agent receives a set of items such that they do not prefer the set of items allocated to the other agent over their own.

The valuations given are:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 10, Item 1 = 17, Item 2 = 77
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 50, Item 1 = 95, Item 2 = 61

To find an allocation, let's calculate the total value each agent attributes to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 10 + 17 + 77 = 104
- Total value for Agent 1: 50 + 95 + 61 = 206

We aim to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's explore allocations:

1. Allocate Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 1, and Item 2 to Agent 0.

   - Agent 0 receives Item 2: Valuation = 77
   - Agent 1 receives Item 0 and Item 1: Valuation = 50 + 95 = 145

   In this allocation:
   - Agent 0 values their allocation at 77, and Agent 1 values their allocation at 145.
   - Neither agent envies the other because Agent 0 values Item 2 more than the sum of Items 0 and 1 (10 + 17 = 27), and Agent 1 values Items 0 and 1 together more than Item 2 alone (61).

This allocation is envy-free since neither agent would prefer to switch allocations with the other based on their own valuations. Therefore, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
