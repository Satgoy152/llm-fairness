Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2
0  82  65  87
1  55  55  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent prefers their own bundle of items over the other agent's bundle. Given the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 82
- Item 1: 65
- Item 2: 87

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 55
- Item 1: 55
- Item 2: 25

Let's consider different allocations and check for envy-freeness:

1. **Allocation 1:**
   - Agent 0 gets items: [0, 2]
   - Agent 1 gets item: [1]

   Valuations for Allocation 1:
   - Agent 0's total value: 82 + 87 = 169
   - Agent 1's total value: 55

   Agent 0 values their allocation more than Agent 1's allocation (169 vs. 55).
   Agent 1 values Agent 0's allocation less than their own (55 < 55 + 25). 

2. **Allocation 2:**
   - Agent 0 gets items: [0, 1]
   - Agent 1 gets item: [2]

   Valuations for Allocation 2:
   - Agent 0's total value: 82 + 65 = 147
   - Agent 1's total value: 25

   Agent 0 values their allocation more than Agent 1's allocation (147 vs. 25).
   Agent 1 values Agent 0's allocation less than their own (25 < 55 + 55).

3. **Allocation 3:**
   - Agent 0 gets item: [2]
   - Agent 1 gets items: [0, 1]

   Valuations for Allocation 3:
   - Agent 0's total value: 87
   - Agent 1's total value: 55 + 55 = 110

   Agent 0 values Agent 1's allocation less than their own (87 < 82 + 65).
   Agent 1 values their allocation more than Agent 0's allocation (110 > 87).

Among these allocations, Allocation 1 and Allocation 2 are envy-free for both agents. Let's choose Allocation 1:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
