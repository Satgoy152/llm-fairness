Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2
0  19   1  41
1  36  41  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation if possible. The goal is to assign items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations, minimizing envy between agents.

Let's evaluate the values each agent has for each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 1
  - Item 2: 41

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 41
  - Item 2: 52

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 41.
   - Agent 1 values it at 52.
   - **Assign to Agent 1** because they value it more (52 vs. 41).

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 1.
   - Agent 1 values it at 41.
   - **Assign to Agent 1** because they value it more (41 vs. 1).

3. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 19.
   - Agent 1 values it at 36.
   - **Assign to Agent 1** because they value it more (36 vs. 19), but since Agent 1 already has two items and for a fair distribution, we need to check if Agent 0 can get any item.

To ensure both agents have at least one item and to create a balance, let's adjust:

- Assign **Item 0** to Agent 0.
- Assign **Items 1 and 2** to Agent 1.

This way, each agent has items that maximize their respective valuations, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the items are distributed based on their valuations to minimize envy.
