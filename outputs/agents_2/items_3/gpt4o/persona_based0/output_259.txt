Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2
0  82  70   3
1  14  74  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [14 74 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to achieve a division that is envy-free, if possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by the other agent over their own bundle.

Here are the valuations from the table:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 82, Item 1 = 70, Item 2 = 3
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 14, Item 1 = 74, Item 2 = 21

Let's consider some possible allocations:

1. **Allocation Attempt 1:**
   - Agent 0 gets Item 0
   - Agent 1 gets Item 1 and Item 2

   Valuations for this allocation:
   - Agent 0 values their allocation at 82.
   - Agent 1 values their allocation at 74 + 21 = 95.

   This allocation is envy-free because:
   - Agent 0 values their allocation (82) higher than Agent 1's allocation (14 + 74 = 88).
   - Agent 1 values their allocation (95) higher than Agent 0's allocation (14).

2. **Allocation Attempt 2:**
   - Agent 0 gets Item 1 and Item 2
   - Agent 1 gets Item 0

   Valuations for this allocation:
   - Agent 0 values their allocation at 70 + 3 = 73.
   - Agent 1 values their allocation at 14.

   This allocation is not envy-free because:
   - Agent 0 values their allocation (73) lower than Agent 1's allocation (82).
   
After analyzing the possible allocations, Allocation Attempt 1 is envy-free and fair as it respects the preferences of both agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
