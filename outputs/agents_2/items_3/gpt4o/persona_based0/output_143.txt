Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2
0  58  67  49
1  60  41  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to any other agent over their own allocation.

Let's first look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 1: 67
  - Item 2: 49

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 60
  - Item 1: 41
  - Item 2: 25

We want to allocate the items such that each agent feels they got the best possible deal based on their own valuations.

One possible approach to achieve envy-freeness is to ensure that each agent gets at least one item they value highly and that the total value of the items they receive is as balanced as possible.

Considering the valuations, we can make the following allocations:

1. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 values it the highest at 67.
2. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values it the highest at 60.
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 since Agent 0's next highest valued item is Item 2 at 49, and Agent 1 values it the least.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2, with a total value of 67 + 49 = 116.
- Agent 1 receives item 0, with a total value of 60.

Both agents receive bundles such that neither envies the other's allocation given their own valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
