Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2
0  10  77  79
1  39  49  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 79
  - Total valuation: 10 + 77 + 79 = 166

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 39
  - Item 1: 49
  - Item 2: 23
  - Total valuation: 39 + 49 + 23 = 111

To achieve an allocation that is envy-free, we should try to allocate items such that each agent perceives they receive at least as much value as the other agent from their allocation. One approach is to allocate the items based on preference, but also ensuring that the total perceived value of each agent is balanced.

Based on the valuations, we can see that Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest and Item 1 second highest, whereas Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest and Item 0 second highest.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Give Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Give Item 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1.

**Justification:**

- **Agent 0:**
  - Gets Item 1 valued at 77.
  - Total valuation from allocation: 77.

- **Agent 1:**
  - Gets Item 0 valued at 39 and Item 2 valued at 23.
  - Total valuation from allocation: 39 + 23 = 62.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the item with the highest value to them that doesn't conflict with the other's highest values. While Agent 0 has a higher total value, the allocation allows each to have their most preferred item that is available after considering the other's preference.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
