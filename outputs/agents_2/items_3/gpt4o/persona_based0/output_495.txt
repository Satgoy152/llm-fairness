Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2
0  13  32  26
1  77  74  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to allocate the items in a manner that is envy-free, if possible. This means each agent should feel that they received a fair share based on their valuations.

The given valuations are:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: Item 0 = 13, Item 1 = 32, Item 2 = 26
- Agent 1 values items as follows: Item 0 = 77, Item 1 = 74, Item 2 = 91

To begin, let's calculate the total value that each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0 = 13 + 32 + 26 = 71
- Total value for Agent 1 = 77 + 74 + 91 = 242

Next, determine how to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy. One approach is to look for the highest value each agent assigns to the individual items and try to allocate those items to maximize perceived fairness.

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for Item 2 (value = 91), followed by Item 0 (value = 77). 
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for Item 1 (value = 32).

A fair allocation, considering the highest values, could be:

- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for this item).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for this item).
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2.

This allocation respects the agents' valuations by giving each agent their top choice available and results in:

- Agent 0 values their allocation (Item 1) at 32.
- Agent 1 values their allocations (Items 0 and 2) at 77 + 91 = 168.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
