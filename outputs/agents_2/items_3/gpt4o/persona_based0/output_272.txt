Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2
0  39  62  15
1  64  33  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to assign items in such a way that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as: [39, 62, 15]
- Agent 1 values items as: [64, 33, 78]

We need to allocate the items in a way that both agents feel they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

One potential allocation could be:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it at 64, which is higher than Agent 0's value of 39.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it at 62, which is higher than Agent 1's value of 33.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it at 78, which is substantially higher than Agent 0's value of 15.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 3. Additionally, neither agent would prefer the other's allocation over their own, as each has received the item they value more highly compared to the other agent.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
