Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2
0  51  94  61
1  18  39  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their valuations.

First, let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 1: 94
  - Item 2: 61

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 1: 39
  - Item 2: 41

A straightforward way to achieve a fair allocation is to assign each agent the item they value the most, if possible, and then allocate the remaining item to ensure all items are distributed.

1. **Identify the highest valued item for each agent:**
   - For Agent 0: The highest valued item is Item 1 (value 94).
   - For Agent 1: The highest valued item is Item 2 (value 41).

2. **Allocate the highest valued items:**
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate the remaining item:**
   - Item 0 is left. We need to allocate it to one of the agents. 
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 51, while Agent 1 values it at 18.
   - Since Agent 0 values Item 0 higher, it would be fairer to allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets Item 2.

This allocation respects each agentâ€™s highest valuation and aims to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
