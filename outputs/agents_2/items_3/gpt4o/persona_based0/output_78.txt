Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2
0  47  60  19
1  17  22  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to create an envy-free allocation. This means we want each agent to receive a bundle of items such that they do not prefer another agent's allocation over their own, based on their individual valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations:
  - Item 0: 47
  - Item 1: 60
  - Item 2: 19

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 17
  - Item 1: 22
  - Item 2: 88

By looking at the valuations, we can consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest (88).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest (60).
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1:
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 47 (Item 0) + 60 (Item 1) = 107
- Agent 1 receives Item 2:
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 88

Both agents receive allocations that maximize their respective valuations and do not prefer the other agent's allocation over their own.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
