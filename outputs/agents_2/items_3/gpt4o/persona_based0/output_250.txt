Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2
0  96  15  94
1  62  21  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation given their own valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 96
  - Item 1: 15
  - Item 2: 94

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 62
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 95

One potential approach to achieve a fair and envy-free allocation is to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their own valuation while minimizing envy towards the other agent's allocation. 

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 96, which is the highest valuation for any item for Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 62, which is lower than their valuation for Item 2.

2. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 at 95, which is the highest valuation for any item for Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 94, which is slightly less than their valuation for Item 0.

3. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:**
   - This leaves Item 1, which is valued at 15 by Agent 0 and 21 by Agent 1.
   - Assigning Item 1 to Agent 0 doesn't significantly impact Agent 1's satisfaction since Agent 1 already receives their most preferred item, Item 2.

### Final Allocation:

This allocation ensures that both agents receive one of their most valued items, minimizing envy, and distributing items fairly given the constraints.

{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
