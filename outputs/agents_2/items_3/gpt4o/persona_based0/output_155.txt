Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2
0  64   9  28
1  39  21   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents based on their valuations, we will aim to achieve an envy-free allocation (if possible), where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. An envy-free allocation is often not possible with integer items when preferences are diverse and the number of items is limited, but we will try to get as close as possible.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to each item:

- **Agent 0's valuations**: 
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 9
  - Item 2: 28

- **Agent 1's valuations**: 
  - Item 0: 39
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 5

Now, let's find an allocation that maximizes fairness. A simple approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, which often helps achieve an envy-free distribution or at least minimizes envy.

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 64, and Agent 1 values it at 39. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 9, and Agent 1 values it at 21. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 28, and Agent 1 values it at 5. Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- **Agent 0 receives items**: 0 and 2
  - Total value for Agent 0: 64 (item 0) + 28 (item 2) = 92

- **Agent 1 receives items**: 1
  - Total value for Agent 1: 21 (item 1)

This allocation minimizes envy within the constraints given, as each agent receives the items they value highest among the unallocated items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
