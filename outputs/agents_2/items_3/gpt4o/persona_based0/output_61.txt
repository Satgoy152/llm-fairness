Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2
0  55  77  89
1   2   3  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items while trying to achieve envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to ensure that neither agent envies the allocation of the other based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 89

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 2
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 20

To achieve envy-freeness, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives according to their preferences.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Highest value item for Agent 0 is Item 2 (value 89).
   - Second highest is Item 1 (value 77).
   - Third is Item 0 (value 55).

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Highest value item for Agent 1 is Item 2 (value 20).
   - Second highest is Item 1 (value 3).
   - Third is Item 0 (value 2).

**Proposed Allocation:**

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 because it has the highest value for them (89), and Agent 1 values it only at 20.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 as well since it is the second most valuable item for them (77), and Agent 1 values it at only 3.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 since Agent 0 already got two items and this leaves the least valuable item for Agent 0.

This allocation ensures Agent 0 gets their top two preferred items, and Agent 1 gets something which they value without any envy, because:

- Agent 0 receives Items 2 and 1, which are their most valued, and Agent 1 receives Item 0.

This allocation minimizes dissatisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
