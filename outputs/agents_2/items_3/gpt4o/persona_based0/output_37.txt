Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2
0  55  58   7
1  55  78  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and allocate them in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

### Agents' Valuations:
- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 7

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 78
  - Item 2: 27

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Item 1**: This item has the highest value for both agents, but Agent 1 values it the most (78 vs. 58). To maximize fairness and reduce envy, assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 0**: Both agents value this item equally (55). Since Agent 1 already received Item 1, assign Item 0 to Agent 0 to balance the shares.

3. **Item 2**: This item has a relatively low valuation for both agents, but Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 (27 vs. 7). To further balance the allocation, assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives Item 0.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.

This allocation is envy-free because:
- Agent 0 receives an item that they value, and since Agent 1 has already received the higher-valued item (Item 1), Agent 0 has no reason to envy Agent 1.
- Agent 1 receives the item they value the most (Item 1) and the next best option (Item 2), which gives them no reason to envy Agent 0.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
