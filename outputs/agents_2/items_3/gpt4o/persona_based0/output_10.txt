Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2
0   2  23  35
1  40  12   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we start by analyzing the value each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: Item 0 = 2, Item 1 = 23, Item 2 = 35
- Agent 1 values items as follows: Item 0 = 40, Item 1 = 12, Item 2 = 7

Given these valuations, we want to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the total value based on their own valuations, and ideally neither agent envies the other's allocation.

One potential allocation can be:

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it significantly higher (40) than Agent 0 (2).
2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it higher (23) than Agent 1 (12), and it complements the allocation of Item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it higher (35) than Agent 1 (7), and it balances the overall value received by Agent 0.

Calculating the total value based on their own valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's total value: 23 (Item 1) + 35 (Item 2) = 58
- Agent 1's total value: 40 (Item 0) = 40

This allocation offers a reasonable balance, given the values, and aims to minimize envy. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
