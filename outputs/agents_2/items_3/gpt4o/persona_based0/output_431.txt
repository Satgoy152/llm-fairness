Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2
0  72  37  92
1  61  56  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that each agent feels they have received a bundle of items that is at least as valuable to them as the bundle received by any other agent.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 72
  - Item 1: 37
  - Item 2: 92

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 61
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 2: 68

Let's analyze the total valuation each agent assigns to the items:

- Total valuation by Agent 0: 72 + 37 + 92 = 201
- Total valuation by Agent 1: 61 + 56 + 68 = 185

We should allocate the items to minimize envy. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it most:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 72
   - Agent 1 values it at 61
   - Assign to Agent 0

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 37
   - Agent 1 values it at 56
   - Assign to Agent 1

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 92
   - Agent 1 values it at 68
   - Assign to Agent 0

This allocation gives Agent 0 items 0 and 2, and Agent 1 item 1. Let's confirm this allocation is reasonable:

- Agent 0 receives items with a total value of 72 + 92 = 164.
- Agent 1 receives an item with a total value of 56.

Agent 0 receives higher total value, but each agent receives the items they value most highly among those available.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
