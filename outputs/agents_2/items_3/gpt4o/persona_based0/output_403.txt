Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2
0  61  60  82
1  43  18  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that satisfies the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. 

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 61
  - Item 1: 60
  - Item 2: 82
  - Total valuation: 61 + 60 + 82 = 203

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 43
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 34
  - Total valuation: 43 + 18 + 34 = 95

To allocate the items, we should consider giving each agent items such that none feels envious of the other's allocation. Let's consider the possible allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 2 (82), and Agent 1 receives items 0 (43) and 1 (18). This allocation results in:
  - Agent 0's total value: 82
  - Agent 1's total value: 43 + 18 = 61

With this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives their highest valued item (82).
- Agent 1 receives both items 0 and 1, which collectively provide a total valuation of 61, which is higher than any single item.

This allocation seems fair and envy-free under these valuations, as neither agent would prefer to switch their allocation with the other.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
