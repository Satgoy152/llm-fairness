Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2
0  69  49  78
1  75  45  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a fair manner, we should consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item and aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy, ideally achieving an envy-free allocation if possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. 

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 69
  - Item 1: 49
  - Item 2: 78

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 45
  - Item 2: 30

Given these valuations, we can aim to allocate items to each agent such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible, and neither agent envies the other's allocation.

1. Agent 0 highly values Item 2 and Item 0, but values Item 1 the least.
2. Agent 1 highly values Item 0, then Item 1, and values Item 2 the least.

A potential allocation that could minimize envy is:

- Give Item 0 to Agent 1, as it's their highest valued item and second highest for Agent 0.
- Give Item 2 to Agent 0, as it's their highest valued item.
- Give Item 1 to Agent 0, as it provides a balanced allocation considering Agent 1's higher valuation for Item 0.

This results in:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0.

Checking the envy:

- Agent 0's total value: 49 (Item 1) + 78 (Item 2) = 127
- Agent 1's total value: 75 (Item 0)

Neither agent envies the other, as Agent 0's total value is higher than Agent 1's. This allocation respects each agent's preferences and provides a fair distribution based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
