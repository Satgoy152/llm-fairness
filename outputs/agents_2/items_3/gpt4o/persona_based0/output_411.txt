Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2
0  96  21  89
1  70  44  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, we should aim to minimize envy while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total value they perceive. This can be approached by considering each agent's valuation of the items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 96
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 89

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 70
  - Item 1: 44
  - Item 2: 37

To ensure fairness, we can try to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is as close as possible, given their preferences. We will also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Considering the valuations, one possible allocation that minimizes envy is:

- Allocate Item 0 and Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

Let's verify this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of 96 + 89 = 185.
- Agent 1 receives item 1, with a total valuation of 44.

This allocation minimizes envy because Agent 0 receives the combination of items that gives them the highest possible valuation, while Agent 1 receives the item that is most valuable to them given the remaining choices.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
