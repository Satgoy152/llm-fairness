Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2
0  41  89   1
1  86   0  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents using the concept of envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to allocate the items such that no agent would prefer the other's allocation over their own.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 41
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 1

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 86
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 98

### Strategy:
Our goal is to ensure each agent feels they received a fair share of the items, based on their individual valuations. We can perform the allocation by considering the highest valuations first and ensuring that both agents receive items that they value highly.

- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 at 89, which is the highest valuation for any item by either agent. Agent 1 values it at 0, so it makes sense for Agent 0 to receive this item to maximize their satisfaction.

- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values item 2 at 98, which is their highest valuation. Therefore, assigning this item to Agent 1 would maximize their satisfaction.

- **Item 0**: After assigning items 1 and 2, item 0 remains. Agent 1 values item 0 at 86, and Agent 0 values it at 41. Assigning item 0 to Agent 1 would maximize their satisfaction without causing envy from Agent 0, as Agent 0 already received their most valued item.

### Allocations:
Based on the above strategy, the allocations will be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents have items they value highly, and neither agent would prefer to swap their allocation with the other, achieving a fair division with respect to their valuations.
