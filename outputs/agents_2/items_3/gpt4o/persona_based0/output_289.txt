Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2
0   6  39  13
1  67  72  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6 39 13]
 [67 72 65]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, meaning that each agent values their bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle.

Here's the valuation table for the agents:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  |
|------------|----|----|----|
| 0          | 6  | 39 | 13 |
| 1          | 67 | 72 | 65 |

Based on the table, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 6 + 39 + 13 = 58
- Agent 1: 67 + 72 + 65 = 204

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should try to allocate items such that neither agent feels that they would be better off with the other agent's allocation. Given the high values Agent 1 has for each item, it seems reasonable to allocate the higher valued items to Agent 1.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values it the most (72).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values it significantly more than Agent 0 (67 vs 6).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 as it has a relatively lower valuation for Agent 1 compared to items 0 and 1.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives item 2, which they value at 13.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1, which they value at 67 and 72, respectively.

Both agents prefer their allocation over the other's, ensuring an envy-free distribution.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
