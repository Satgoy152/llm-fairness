Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2
0  99  25  34
1  87  93  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly while considering the valuations provided by the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-freeness as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of items received by another agent over their own allocation, based on their valuations.

Let's examine the given valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     |   99   |   25   |   34   |
| 1     |   87   |   93   |   62   |

To attempt an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation, we can follow these steps:

1. **Agent 0** highly values Item 0 (99), so it would be ideal to allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values Item 1 (93), so it would be ideal to allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. For Item 2, both agents have lower valuations in comparison to their highest-valued items, but let's check their preferences:
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 34.
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 at 62.

Since Agent 1 values Item 2 more than Agent 0, it would be reasonable to give Item 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation aims to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives the item they value the most highly, and any remaining item goes to the agent who values it more.

Thus, the final allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
