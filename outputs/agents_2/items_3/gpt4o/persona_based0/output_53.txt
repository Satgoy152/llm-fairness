Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2
0  67  16  84
1  17  28  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are assigned.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 67
  - Item 1: 16
  - Item 2: 84
  - Total value if they get all items: 67 + 16 + 84 = 167

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 17
  - Item 1: 28
  - Item 2: 73
  - Total value if they get all items: 17 + 28 + 73 = 118

Let's consider a few allocation strategies:

1. **Allocate Highest Valued Items Individually:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (84), and Agent 1 values Item 2 at 73, which is also the highest for them. 
   - However, Agent 0 values Item 2 significantly higher than Agent 1, so we assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Next, Agent 0 values Item 0 at 67, which is also higher than Agent 1's valuation of 17. So, we assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Finally, Agent 1 is left with Item 1, which they value at 28, compared to Agent 0's 16.

2. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0 and 2
   - Agent 1: Item 1

This allocation ensures that both agents receive at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 3.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
