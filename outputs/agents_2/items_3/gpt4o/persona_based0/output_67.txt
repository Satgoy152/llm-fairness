Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2
0  54  94  45
1  46  44  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46 44 37]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the integer constraints. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

### Valuations Table:
| Items  | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Item 0 |   54    |   46    |
| Item 1 |   94    |   44    |
| Item 2 |   45    |   37    |

### Approach:
1. **Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 54 + 94 + 45 = 193
   - Agent 1: 46 + 44 + 37 = 127

2. **Item-by-Item Comparison:**
   - **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 54, whereas Agent 1 values it at 46.
   - **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 94, whereas Agent 1 values it at 44.
   - **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 45, whereas Agent 1 values it at 37.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Since Agent 0 has higher valuations for all items, they should receive items that maximize their satisfaction without leaving Agent 1 with no value.
   - To ensure fairness, we can give Agent 0 the items they value the most and give Agent 1 some value as well.

Based on the valuations and the goal of fairness, the following allocation is proposed:

- **Agent 0:** Given their higher valuation, allocate them Item 1 (94) and Item 2 (45).
- **Agent 1:** Allocate Item 0 (46).

This allocation provides Agent 0 with a total value of 139 and Agent 1 with a total value of 46, which is relatively fair considering the initial valuation distribution.

### Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
