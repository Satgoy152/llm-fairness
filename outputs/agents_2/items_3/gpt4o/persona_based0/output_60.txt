Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2
0  21  37  19
1  81  87  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we must consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to make each agent feel they received a fair share based on their perceived value of the items.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 21     | 37     | 19     |
| 1     | 81     | 87     | 20     |

Let's analyze the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(21 + 37 + 19 = 77\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(81 + 87 + 20 = 188\)

Now, let's assign the items to ensure that each agent feels they have received at least their fair share:

1. **Item 1** has the highest valuation for both agents (37 for Agent 0 and 87 for Agent 1). Assigning it to Agent 1 maximizes Agent 1's satisfaction without causing too much envy, as Agent 1 values this item much more than Agent 0.

2. **Item 0** is valued at 81 by Agent 1 and 21 by Agent 0. Giving this item to Agent 1 will make them significantly more satisfied.

3. **Item 2** is valued at 19 by Agent 0 and 20 by Agent 1. To balance the allocation, we give this item to Agent 0, ensuring they get at least one item.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives Item 2.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1.

This allocation minimizes envy as Agent 0 gets the item they value, and Agent 1 receives the items they highly value.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
