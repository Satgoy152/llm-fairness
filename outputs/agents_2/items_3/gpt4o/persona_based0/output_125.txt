Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2
0  78  35  81
1  25  84  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to each item. A common goal is to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 78
- Item 1: 35
- Item 2: 81

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 25
- Item 1: 84
- Item 2: 69

To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation, we can start by assigning the items based on each agent's highest valuation. Here is a potential allocation:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the most (81).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most (84).

Now, we need to allocate Item 0. We strive to maintain an envy-free allocation:

- Agent 0 values Item 0 at 78, while Agent 1 values it at 25. Assigning Item 0 to Agent 0 maximizes Agent 0's satisfaction and maintains envy-freeness because Agent 1's higher valued item is already in their possession.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value and minimizes potential envy. The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with Agent 0 receiving Items 0 and 2, and Agent 1 receiving Item 1.
