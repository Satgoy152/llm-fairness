Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2
0  86  36  97
1  56  61  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent, aiming for an envy-free distribution. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 86
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 97

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 56
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 98

To find a fair allocation, we will consider assigning each item to the agent who values it most highly. However, since we have only 2 agents and 3 items, we'll need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item.

Valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 values it at 56 → Assign to Agent 0
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 values it at 61 → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 values it at 98 → Assign to Agent 1

This initial allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 1, Item 2

This allocation is not envy-free because Agent 0 might prefer the allocation of Agent 1 due to high value on Item 2. To ensure a more balanced allocation, we should try to make sure that each agent's total value from their allocated items is maximized according to the highest possible value they can get comparatively.

Let's try a different approach by adjusting to balance the envy:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0

Now the allocations look like:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (86) and Item 1 (36) → Total value = 122
- Agent 1: Item 2 (98) → Total value = 98

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 does not envy Agent 1 because their total value (122) from items 0 and 1 is greater than the single item 2 that Agent 1 has (98). Meanwhile, Agent 1 does not envy Agent 0 because the high value of item 2 matches their preference.

Thus, the allocation is:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
