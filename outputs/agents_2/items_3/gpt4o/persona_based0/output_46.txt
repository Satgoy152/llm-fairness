Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2
0  91  81  30
1  34  46  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 81 30]
 [34 46 14]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can look at the valuations that each agent places on the items. Our goal is to allocate the items such that the distribution is as fair as possible, potentially using principles such as maximizing the minimum utility or reducing envy.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2
0  91  81  30
1  34  46  14
```

Agent 0 values the items as follows:
- Item 0: 91
- Item 1: 81
- Item 2: 30

Agent 1 values the items as follows:
- Item 0: 34
- Item 1: 46
- Item 2: 14

A potential allocation strategy could be:
1. Assign the item with the highest valuation to the respective agent if there's no contention. Here, Agent 0 values item 0 the most (91).
2. For the next highest valuation item, consider the highest bidder unless it creates significant envy. Agent 0 should ideally get item 1 (81).
3. The last item, item 2, should go to Agent 1, as it provides some value (14) and Agent 0 already has two items.

Based on this, the allocation would be:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution attempts to reduce envy by giving high-value items to the agent who values them the most.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
