Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2
0  43  61  10
1  98  46  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent would prefer the bundle of items received by another over their own. Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 43
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 10

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 36

A potential strategy is to assign each agent the item they value most highly, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item they value significantly, which is a step towards envy-freeness. However, we only have 3 items and need to allocate them all.

1. **Agent 1** values Item 0 the most at 98. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values Item 1 the most at 61. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. We are left with Item 2. To minimize envy, we should choose an allocation that keeps the perceived value as balanced as possible:
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it at 36 compared to Agent 0's valuation of 10.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 gets Item 1, with a total valuation of 61.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of 98 + 36 = 134.

Both agents receive items they value highly, and the allocations attempt to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's perceived value of their own allocation relative to the other agent's allocation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
