Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2
0   5  90  90
1  15  30  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address the problem of fairly allocating the items to the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free to the extent possible and that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations matrix:

```
       0   1   2
Agent
0      5  90  90
1     15  30  97
```

We want to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. 

### Initial Observations:

- Agent 0 values item 1 and item 2 equally and much higher than item 0.
- Agent 1 places the highest value on item 2, followed by item 1, and values item 0 the least.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (97), while Agent 0 values it at 90. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 to maximize their satisfaction for at least one item.
   
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Both agents have high valuations for item 1 (90 for Agent 0 and 30 for Agent 1), but Agent 0 values it more compared to Agent 1. Therefore, allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   
3. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 more than Agent 0 (15 vs. 5). Therefore, assign item 0 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item and maximizes the total valuation for each agent based on their respective preferences.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation considers the valuations and aims to provide a distribution where no agent feels envious given the constraints.
