Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2
0  15  21  66
1  36  66  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the total value each agent assigns to the items and try to achieve a distribution where each agent receives items maximizing their utility, and ideally, no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 15
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 66

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 66
  - Item 2: 31

The goal is to allocate all 3 items in a way that is fair, considering the valuations.

To solve this, we can use an approach called the "Envy-Free Allocation" method, where we try to minimize envy by ensuring each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value what any other agent receives.

Let's consider a possible allocation:

1. Give item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Give items 0 and 1 to Agent 1.

Here's the reasoning:

- Agent 0 receives item 2, which they value at 66.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1, which they value at 36 + 66 = 102.

Checking for envy:
- Agent 0 values their allocation (66) less than Agent 1's allocation (51), but since they have their highest valued item, it's a strategic allocation.
- Agent 1 values their allocation (102) higher than Agent 0's allocation (15), and since they have more items, they should be satisfied.

This allocation ensures that both agents have a reasonable distribution of value based on their individual preferences.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
