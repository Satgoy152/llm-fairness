Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2
0  99  81  71
1  97   9   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items while considering envy-freeness, we'll aim to distribute them such that each agent is as satisfied as possible given their valuations.

From the table:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 99, Item 1 = 81, Item 2 = 71.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 97, Item 1 = 9, Item 2 = 9.

To ensure fairness and minimize envy, we can observe that:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 0 (99 compared to Agent 1's 97). Allocating Item 0 to Agent 0 would maximize Agent 0's satisfaction and minimize potential envy, as Agent 0 values it more than any other item.

2. Both agents value Item 1 and Item 2 significantly differently. Agent 0 values Item 1 as 81 and Item 2 as 71, while Agent 1 values both as 9. Therefore, it is more beneficial to allocate either Item 1 or Item 2 to Agent 1, as this allocation minimizes the gap in perceived value between the agents.

3. By giving Agent 1 Item 2 (valued at 9 by both agents), we minimize Agent 0's potential for envy because Agent 0 values Item 2 less than Item 1.

4. Lastly, we allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as it has the higher value (81) for Agent 0 compared to Agent 1.

Based on this analysis, a fair allocation of the items would be:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2.

This allocation should minimize envy as Agent 0 receives the items they value the most, and Agent 1 receives an item that Agent 0 values the least among the remaining options.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
