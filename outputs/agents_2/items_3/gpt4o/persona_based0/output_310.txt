Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2
0  80  94  36
1  38  92  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items so that each agent feels that they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Let's analyze the valuations:

Valuations table:
```
      Items
      0   1   2
0   80  94  36
1   38  92  48
```

- Agent 0's valuations: Item 0 = 80, Item 1 = 94, Item 2 = 36
- Agent 1's valuations: Item 0 = 38, Item 1 = 92, Item 2 = 48

To achieve envy-freeness, we can try different allocations:

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 and Items 0 and 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0 receives Item 1: Value = 94
   - Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2: Value = 38 + 48 = 86

With this allocation:
- Agent 0 values their allocation at 94.
- Agent 1 values their allocation at 86.

Agent 0 might have a higher total value, but each agent does not envy the other's allocation based on their own valuations. This allocation achieves a fair and envy-free distribution given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
