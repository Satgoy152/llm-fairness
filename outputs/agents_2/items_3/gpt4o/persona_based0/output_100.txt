Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2
0  42  90  30
1  31  83  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (agent 0 and agent 1) while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation, if possible.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 42
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 30

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 83
  - Item 2: 35

To achieve a fair allocation, we can try to maximize each agent's perceived value of their own allocation while minimizing potential envy.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest at 90.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 at 83, which is less than Agent 0's valuation.

2. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 31.
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 42, but since Agent 0 already has Item 1 valued at 90, they are less likely to envy.

3. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 at 35.
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 30, which is lower than Agent 1's valuation.

With this allocation, Agent 0 receives Item 1, and Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2. This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives while minimizing envy.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all three items are distributed, and each agent receives a set of items that should reduce envy, given their valuations.
