Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2
0  44   6  69
1  99  75  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to examine the valuation matrix and determine a distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share.

The valuation matrix is as follows:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  |
|------------|----|----|----|
| 0          | 44 | 6  | 69 |
| 1          | 99 | 75 | 63 |

To ensure envy-freeness, we want each agent to feel they have as much value as possible. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most (99), so it would be reasonable to allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (69), so it would be reasonable to allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
3. Item 1 is left, and Agent 1 has a higher valuation (75) compared to Agent 0 (6). Therefore, it would be reasonable to allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

Now each agent has items such that they receive items they value the most, minimizing envy.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
