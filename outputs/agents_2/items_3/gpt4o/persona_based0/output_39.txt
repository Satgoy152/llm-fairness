Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2
0  65  62  60
1  65  65   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation given their valuations.

Let's first examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 65
  - Item 1: 62
  - Item 2: 60

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 65
  - Item 1: 65
  - Item 2: 4

An optimal allocation would aim to minimize envy. We should consider how each agent values the items and attempt to allocate them in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring that there is no envy or at least minimizing it as much as possible.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values item 0 the highest (65), followed by item 1 (62), and then item 2 (60).
   - Can be given item 1 to balance the allocation since Agent 1 values item 1 equally but values item 0 the highest as well.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values item 0 the highest (65) and item 1 equally (65), but item 2 the least (4).
   - Can be given item 0 which is valued the highest by both agents, but agent 1 values it equally to item 1, reducing potential envy if agent 0 gets item 1.

3. **Remaining Item**:
   - Item 2 should be given to Agent 0, as Agent 1 values it significantly less (4), minimizing potential envy.

### Final Allocation

Given the above considerations, here is one potential allocation that tries to balance satisfaction and minimize envy:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner that is as close to envy-free as possible given the integer constraint and the agents' valuations.
