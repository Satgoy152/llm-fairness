Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2
0  65   2  57
1  21  26  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we need to aim for an envy-free distribution. This means no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent when considering their own valuation.

Let's summarize the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 65
  - Item 1 at 2
  - Item 2 at 57

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 21
  - Item 1 at 26
  - Item 2 at 11

A potential approach to ensure fairness and minimize envy is to allocate items in a way that each agent receives the items they value the most, within the constraints of one item per agent.

Let's evaluate and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 65, while Agent 1 values it at 21. 
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 2, while Agent 1 values it at 26.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 57, while Agent 1 values it at 11.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures both agents receive the items they value most highly among the remaining choices:
- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 1.

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation should minimize envy and be considered fair given the context and constraints.
