Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2
0  21  14  33
1  13  86  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that seeks to minimize envy and ensure some notion of fairness. A common approach is to try to maximize the minimum satisfaction or to ensure that each agent gets items they highly value as much as possible.

Given the valuation matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 21     | 14     | 33     |
| 1     | 13     | 86     | 24     |

Let's evaluate a potential allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item more than Agent 1 (21 vs. 13).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item significantly more than Agent 0 (86 vs. 14).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item more than Agent 1 (33 vs. 24).

A potential allocation could be:
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation gives Agent 0 two items they value highly and Agent 1 the item they value the most.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation is designed to minimize potential envy and maximize each agent's satisfaction given their respective valuations.
