Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2
0  94   3  55
1  13  69  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items based on the given valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that the allocation is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Valuation Matrix:**
   - Agent 0: Values items as [94, 3, 55]
   - Agent 1: Values items as [13, 69, 43]

2. **Fair Division Strategy:**
   - We will allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, attempting to avoid envy.

3. **Calculating Total Values:**
   - Total value for Agent 0: 94 + 3 + 55 = 152
   - Total value for Agent 1: 13 + 69 + 43 = 125

4. **Allocation Decision:**
   - Agent 0 has a high valuation for Item 0. We allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has a high valuation for Item 1. We allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
   - For Item 2, Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 (55 vs 43). To minimize envy and ensure a fair allocation, we allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2.
   - Agent 1 receives Item 1.

By this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and we attempt to balance the total valuation as much as possible given the constraints.

**Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents get items they highly value, reducing potential envy and aiming for a fair distribution.
