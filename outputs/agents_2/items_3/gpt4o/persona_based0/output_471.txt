Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2
0  26  82  85
1  80  75  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a manner that aims to minimize envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or minimizing the maximum envy between agents. Given the valuations provided, we can consider different allocations to see which one might be more balanced.

The value table is as follows:

```
    0   1   2
0  26  82  85
1  80  75  76
```

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent would have for each potential allocation and attempt to make them as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

Given the valuations, one strategy could be to allocate items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is as close as possible. Here are a few potential allocations and their respective total valuations:

1. **Allocation 1:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
   - Agent 1: Item [0]
   
   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 82 + 85 = 167
   - Agent 1: 80
   
   This allocation results in significant envy from Agent 1 towards Agent 0.

2. **Allocation 2:**
   - Agent 0: Item [2]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
   
   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 85
   - Agent 1: 80 + 75 = 155
   
   This allocation results in significant envy from Agent 0 towards Agent 1.

3. **Allocation 3:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
   - Agent 1: Item [2]
   
   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 26 + 82 = 108
   - Agent 1: 76
   
   This allocation provides a more balanced approach with the least envy.

### Selected Allocation:

Upon analyzing the valuations and potential allocations, the third allocation seems to provide a more balanced approach with less envy. Hence, the fair division based on the given valuations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.
