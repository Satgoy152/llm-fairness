Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2
0  43  55  58
1  45  15  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we want to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness in this context implies that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own bundle, given their valuations.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 43
  - Item 1 at 55
  - Item 2 at 58

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 45
  - Item 1 at 15
  - Item 2 at 54

A straightforward approach to ensuring fairness is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring the allocation is envy-free.

Let's consider the allocations:

1. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest (58).
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 at 54.

2. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 45, slightly more than Agent 0's valuation of 43.

3. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 55, whereas Agent 1 values it at 15.

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items they value the highest (items 1 and 2), and Agent 1 receives item 0, which they value slightly more than Agent 0.

Checking for envy:
- Agent 0 has items 1 and 2 with a total valuation of 113 (55 + 58).
- Agent 1 has item 0 with a valuation of 45.

Agent 0 prefers their own allocation over Agent 1's allocation, and Agent 1 cannot improve their situation by swapping given their valuation.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
