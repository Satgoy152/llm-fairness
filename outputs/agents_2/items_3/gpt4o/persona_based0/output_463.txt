Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2
0  37  59  22
1  27  98  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for each item. 

Let's outline the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 37
  - Item 1: 59
  - Item 2: 22

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 27
  - Item 1: 98
  - Item 2: 36

To achieve a fair division, ideally, each agent should feel that they received a fair share, meaning they should not envy the allocation of the other agent based on their valuations.

Let's explore the allocations:

- **Step 1**: Consider each agent's highest valuation for the items. Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest (59), and Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest as well (98). Since both agents desire Item 1 the most, we should consider other options to reduce envy.

- **Step 2**: Assign the highest valued item based on a difference in valuation that is the largest. Agent 1 values Item 1 significantly higher than Agent 0. Thus, allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

- **Step 3**: Now, consider the remaining items (Item 0 and Item 2). Agent 0 values Item 0 higher (37) than Agent 1 does (27), so assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

- **Step 4**: Allocate the remaining item, Item 2, to Agent 0 as well, since Agent 0 values it (22), and Agent 1 already received the item they valued most.

This allocation minimizes envy since each agent receives at least one item they value reasonably, and Agent 1 receives the item they value the most.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
