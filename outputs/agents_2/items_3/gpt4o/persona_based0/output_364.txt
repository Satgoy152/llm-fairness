Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2
0  11  84  29
1   4  50  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the concept of maximizing utility by assigning items in a way that minimizes envy between the agents. Let's evaluate the agents' preferences for each item based on the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 11
- Item 1: 84
- Item 2: 29

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 4
- Item 1: 50
- Item 2: 21

We aim for an allocation that maximizes total utility while minimizing envy. We can start by assigning the items based on who values them most:

1. Item 1: 
   - Agent 0 values this the most (84 vs 50), so Agent 0 gets Item 1.

2. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values this more than Agent 1 (29 vs 21), so Agent 0 gets Item 2.

3. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values this more than Agent 1 (11 vs 4), so Agent 0 gets Item 0.

This allocation gives all items to Agent 0, which is not desirable as Agent 1 receives nothing. Therefore, we need to consider a fairer allocation:

Re-evaluating to split items:

1. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (next highest value not assigned).
3. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (since Agent 0 already has a high-value item).

After this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2.

This ensures that both agents receive items and minimizes envy based on their valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
