Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2
0  86  83  33
1  58  56  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness is achieved if no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 86
  - Item 1: 83
  - Item 2: 33
  - Total valuation: 86 + 83 + 33 = 202

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 2: 39
  - Total valuation: 58 + 56 + 39 = 153

Agent 0 values the items more highly overall. A fair division would try to balance the perceived value each agent receives. 

Let's evaluate some possible allocations:

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 and Items 1 and 2 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0 receives: Item 0 (value = 86)
   - Agent 1 receives: Item 1 (value = 56) + Item 2 (value = 39) = 95
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 86
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 95

2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 and Items 0 and 2 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0 receives: Item 1 (value = 83)
   - Agent 1 receives: Item 0 (value = 58) + Item 2 (value = 39) = 97
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 83
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 97

3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 and Items 0 and 1 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0 receives: Item 2 (value = 33)
   - Agent 1 receives: Item 0 (value = 58) + Item 1 (value = 56) = 114
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 33
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 114

Given these options, the allocation that minimizes the difference in perceived value between the agents is the first allocation. It balances the total valuation more evenly between Agent 0 and Agent 1.

Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
