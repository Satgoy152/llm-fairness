Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2
0  35  65  88
1  31   4  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations while ensuring that no agent envies the other. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation given to the other agent based on their own valuations.

The agents and their valuations for each item are as follows:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 65
  - Item 2: 88

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 4
  - Item 2: 68

To determine a fair allocation, we look at the combinations of items that can be distributed between the two agents. We want both agents to feel they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's consider a potential allocation that maximizes the value for each agent while trying to maintain fairness:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0. This item has the highest value (88) for Agent 0 and is also the highest among all items for both agents.
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1. While Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 has a significant valuation of 31 for it, which is close to their highest valuation for any item.
3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0. This gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 153 (65 + 88), which is higher than Agent 1's total valuation of 31.

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives items that they value highly, and Agent 1 receives the item they value most. Although Agent 1's total valuation is lower, the allocation prevents Agent 1 from envying Agent 0 since they receive the item with their next highest valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each item is allocated, and each agent feels they have received the best available items within the constraints.
