Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2
0  33  49  42
1  20  39  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and allocate them to maximize fairness and minimize potential envy.

Here's a step-by-step approach to determining a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation for all items: 33 + 49 + 42 = 124
   - Agent 1's total valuation for all items: 20 + 39 + 77 = 136

2. **Determine the Highest Valuation per Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 33; Agent 1 values it at 20. (Agent 0 values higher)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 49; Agent 1 values it at 39. (Agent 0 values higher)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 42; Agent 1 values it at 77. (Agent 1 values higher)

3. **Allocate Items Based on High Valuation Preferences:**
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 because they have a significantly higher valuation for it.
   - Allocate Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 0 because they have higher valuations for both compared to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, thereby minimizing envy. Agent 0 receives items with a total valuation of 82 (33 + 49), while Agent 1 receives an item with a valuation of 77. 

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
