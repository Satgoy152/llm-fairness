Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2
0  44  34  74
1  78   5  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free, where each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value any other agent's allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0 at 44
  - Item 1 at 34
  - Item 2 at 74

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 78
  - Item 1 at 5
  - Item 2 at 60

To ensure an envy-free allocation, let's consider the preferences:

1. **Agent 0** prefers Item 2 the most (74), followed by Item 0 (44), and lastly Item 1 (34).
2. **Agent 1** prefers Item 0 the most (78), followed by Item 2 (60), and lastly Item 1 (5).

Based on these preferences, a potential allocation could be:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (since it is their highest-valued item).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (since it is their highest-valued item).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 1 values it very low, making it less likely to cause envy.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives their most valued available item without envying the other's allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Items 2 and 1 (valued at 74 and 34, total 108).
- Agent 1 receives Item 0 (valued at 78).

Both agents receive allocations that they value more than they would value the other's allocation, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0]
}
```
