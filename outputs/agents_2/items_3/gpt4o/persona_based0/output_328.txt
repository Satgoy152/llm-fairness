Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

   0   1   2
0  2  51  72
1  4  44  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items based on the given valuations and achieve envy-freeness, we want to ensure that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 2
  - Item 1: 51
  - Item 2: 72

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 4
  - Item 1: 44
  - Item 2: 26

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent gets at least one item and no agent envies the other's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's consider the possible allocations:

1. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 and items 0 and 1 to Agent 1:**

   - Agent 0 receives item 2, which they value at 72.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1, which they value at \(4 + 44 = 48\).

   This allocation is envy-free because:
   - Agent 0 values their allocation (72) higher than Agent 1's allocation (48).
   - Agent 1 values their allocation (48) higher than Agent 0's allocation (2 for item 0, 51 for item 1, and 72 for item 2).

Thus, the fair and envy-free allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
