Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2
0   0  72  29
1  18  35  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 35 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and considers each agent's valuation. The valuation table is:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 0      | 72     | 29     |
| 1     | 18     | 35     | 98     |

The goal is to allocate the items so that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 3.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 0
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 29

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 98

To minimize envy, we should aim to allocate items so that the total perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values Item 2 the most at 98. Allocating this item to Agent 1 gives them the highest satisfaction for one item.

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values Item 1 at 72, which is the highest value they have for any item. Allocating Item 1 to Agent 0 maximizes their perceived value.

3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values Item 0 at 18, and since Agent 0 values it at 0, it is less impactful to give it to Agent 1.

**Final Allocations:**

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 2

This allocation should minimize envy as much as possible given the valuations.

{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
