Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2
0  44  96  94
1  59   3  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to minimize envy, where one agent prefers the allocation of the other agent over their own. This often involves maximizing the total value each agent derives from their items, given their individual valuations.

Let's examine each agent's valuation for the items:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 44
  - Item 1 at 96
  - Item 2 at 94

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 59
  - Item 1 at 3
  - Item 2 at 65

To find an envy-free allocation, we can consider the following approach:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as it is the highest valued item for Agent 0, with a value of 96.
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as it is the highest valued item for Agent 1, with a value of 65.
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it at 59, which is higher than Agent 0's second-highest remaining value (44 for Item 0).

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2.

Now, let's represent this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 3.
