Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2
0   0  34  84
1  44  75  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find a fair allocation of the items between the two agents, we must consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate all three items in a way that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible.

Let's consider the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 0
  - Item 1: 34
  - Item 2: 84

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 44
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 44

We aim to allocate all three items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation. One common approach is to maximize the sum of utilities or to ensure that each agent receives items that they value most, while also considering envy-freeness.

### Possible Allocation:

1. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values this item the most (84), and giving it to them maximizes their utility.

2. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1:**
   - Although Agent 0 also values this item, Agent 1 values it more (75 compared to 34). This allocation reduces potential envy from Agent 1 towards Agent 0.

3. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values this item at 44, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation (0). Thus, Agent 1 should receive this item to maximize fairness and utility.

### Summary:
- Agent 0 receives Item 2.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, thereby minimizing envy. Agent 0 receives their most valued item, and Agent 1 receives items they value significantly.

### Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
