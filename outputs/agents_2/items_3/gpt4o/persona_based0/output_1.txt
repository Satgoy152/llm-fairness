Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2
0   4  80  92
1  46  88  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that they value highly while also attempting to maintain envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [4, 80, 92]
- Agent 1: [46, 88, 87]

We examine the valuations to determine how to distribute the items. Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 92, while Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 88. The goal is to maximize satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, while keeping the allocations fair.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it the most.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it the most.
3. For item 0, Agent 1 values it higher (46) than Agent 0 (4), so assign item 0 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives Agent 0 the item they value most and Agent 1 the items they value significantly. The result is:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1.

This way, each agent receives a bundle of items, and we attempt to minimize envy, although complete envy-freeness is challenging given the discrete nature of allocations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

Agent 0 receives item 2, and Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.
