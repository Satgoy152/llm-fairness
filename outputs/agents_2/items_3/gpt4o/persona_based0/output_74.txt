Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2
0  81  88  79
1  48  12  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they receive at least as much value as the other agent when considering their own valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuation matrix:

|       | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| Agent 0 |   81   |   88   |   79   |
| Agent 1 |   48   |   12   |   70   |

**Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**

- Agent 0's total valuation for all items: 81 + 88 + 79 = 248
- Agent 1's total valuation for all items: 48 + 12 + 70 = 130

**Step 2: Consider Allocations**

To achieve a fair division, we look for a way to allocate items such that each agent receives the maximum possible value according to their own valuations.

**Potential Allocations:**

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, Item 1 to Agent 1, and Item 2 to Agent 0:**

   - Agent 0 receives items [0, 2]: Total value = 81 + 79 = 160
   - Agent 1 receives item [1]: Total value = 12

   This allocation gives Agent 0 a significantly higher total value. However, it minimizes Agent 1's envy because they receive their least valued item.

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, Item 0 to Agent 1, and Item 2 to Agent 1:**

   - Agent 0 receives item [1]: Total value = 88
   - Agent 1 receives items [0, 2]: Total value = 48 + 70 = 118

   This allocation gives Agent 0 a higher total value on their end, and Agent 1 receives two items that together have a significant total value for them.

**Step 3: Select the Fair Allocation**

The second allocation provides a more balanced distribution:

- Agent 0 receives item 1, which they value the highest.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2, which together maximizes their valuation.

While there's no perfect envy-free solution due to the disparity in the total valuations, this allocation minimizes potential envy while distributing items fairly based on individual valuations.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
