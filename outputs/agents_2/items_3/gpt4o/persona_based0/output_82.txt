Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2
0  36  43  25
1   6  75  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, we first consider the valuations each agent assigns to each item.

Here's the table of valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 36     | 43     | 25     |
| 1     | 6      | 75     | 77     |

To achieve an envy-free distribution, we aim for each agent to receive items that maximize their valuation without causing envy over the allocation of items to the other agent.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest (43), followed by Item 0 (36), and then Item 2 (25).
- Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest (77), followed by Item 1 (75), and then Item 0 (6).

A fair and envy-free allocation would give each agent their highest valued item(s) where possible without overlap, ensuring the total number of items allocated equals 3.

Considering the valuations:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as it is highly valued by them and only slightly lower than their valuation of Item 2. This prevents potential envy since Item 1 is much more valuable to Agent 1 than to Agent 0.
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, since it is the highest valued item for them.
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 since it is their second highest valued item and Agent 1 values it the least.

Thus, the allocation becomes:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 3, satisfying the conditions.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
