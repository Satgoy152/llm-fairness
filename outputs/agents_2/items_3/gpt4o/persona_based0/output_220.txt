Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2
0  73  95  28
1  41  72  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided and aim to minimize any envy that might arise between the agents. Our goal is to allocate all items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the valuations.

Below is the valuation table for the agents:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 73     | 95     | 28     |
| 1     | 41     | 72     | 28     |

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (95)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (73)
   - Lowest: Item 2 (28)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (72)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (41)
   - Lowest: Item 2 (28)

Given the valuations, both agents value Item 1 the most, but Agent 0 values it higher. Both agents value Item 2 the least equally. To ensure a fair division with minimized envy:

- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it the most.
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1, as it is the second-highest valued item and avoids giving all high-value items to one agent.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0, as it balances the allocation by recognizing Agent 0's overall higher valuation.

This allocation gives each agent one item they value significantly, thus minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
