Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2
0  47  90   2
1  51  10  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 47
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 2

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 1: 10
  - Item 2: 41

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their own allocation. We can approach this by assigning items based on the highest relative valuation for each agent.

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

1. **Assign Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 significantly higher (90) than Agent 1 (10). Thus, it makes sense to allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Assign Item 0**: 
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 higher (51) than Agent 0 (47). Thus, we allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Assign Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 2, while Agent 1 values it at 41. Hence, Item 2 should be allocated to Agent 1.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2.

This allocation is envy-free because:

- Agent 0 receives the item they value the most (Item 1).
- Agent 1 receives the items that collectively have the highest value for them (Items 0 and 2).

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
