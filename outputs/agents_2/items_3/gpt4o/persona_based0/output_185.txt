Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2
0  73   1  51
1  30  35  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness where possible. Envy-freeness means each agent should feel they have received the best possible allocation given their valuations. Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 73, Item 1 = 1, Item 2 = 51.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 30, Item 1 = 35, Item 2 = 98.

Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items, and that all items must be allocated, one possible approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation from their allocated items.

### Allocation Procedure:

1. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 1 values this item highest at 98.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 significantly higher (73) than Agent 1 (30).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values this item as 1, while Agent 1 values it as 35.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2

Let's verify:
- Agent 0 receives a total valuation of 73 (from Item 0).
- Agent 1 receives a total valuation of 133 (from Items 1 and 2).

This allocation attempts to minimize envy, as each agent receives a combination of items that values their preferences.

### Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
