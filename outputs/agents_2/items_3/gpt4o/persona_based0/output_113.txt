Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2
0  88  21  16
1  35  98  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items while considering envy-freeness, we will attempt to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 88
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 16

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 98
  - Item 2: 95

We need to consider allocations that respect each agent's preferences as much as possible.

One potential allocation that could work is:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it the highest (88), and Agent 1 values it less (35).

2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it the highest (98), and Agent 0 values it less (21).

3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it highly (95), and Agent 0 values it the least (16).

This allocation respects the preference rankings of the items to minimize potential envy:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0, which is their highest valued item.
- Agent 1 gets Items 1 and 2, both of which are highly valued by them.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
