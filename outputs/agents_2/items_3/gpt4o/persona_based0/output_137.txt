Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2
0  50   3  70
1  66  97  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we'll consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 50
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 70

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 1: 97
  - Item 2: 85

Let's analyze the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 50 + 3 + 70 = 123
- Agent 1: 66 + 97 + 85 = 248

Next, let's identify the best allocation by examining how each item contributes to an agent's total valuation. We aim to allocate items such that no agent feels envious of another's share. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest (70), and it's also relatively high for Agent 1 (85). However, Agent 0 values it more in relative terms compared to its total valuation (70/123).
2. Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (97), significantly more than Agent 0 (3), which favors Agent 1 receiving it.
3. Item 0 is valued fairly by both, but slightly more by Agent 1 (66 vs. 50).

A potential fair allocation that considers the highest valuation differences might be:

- Give Item 1 to Agent 1 (since they value it highly and much more than Agent 0).
- Give Item 2 to Agent 0 (since they value it highly, and it helps balance the allocations).
- Give Item 0 to Agent 1 (since they value it slightly more than Agent 0).

This allocation gives each agent a share that is considered fair by their valuation, reducing potential envy.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
