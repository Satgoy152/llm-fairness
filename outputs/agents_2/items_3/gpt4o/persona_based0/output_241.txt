Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2
0  16  49  50
1  90  25  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a distribution that is envy-free or as close to it as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 16     | 49     | 50     |
| 1     | 90     | 25     | 46     |

Let's consider each agent's total value for each potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 16
  - Item 1: 49
  - Item 2: 50

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 25
  - Item 2: 46

To minimize envy, we can allocate items based on the highest individual valuations for each item:

1. **Allocate Item 0**: Agent 1 values this the most (90 vs. 16).
2. **Allocate Item 1**: Agent 0 values this the most (49 vs. 25).
3. **Allocate Item 2**: Agent 0 values this the most (50 vs. 46).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 2 (total value: 99)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (total value: 90)

Agent 0 has a total value of 99 from their allocation, and Agent 1 has a total value of 90. This is reasonably envy-free because neither agent would prefer the other's allocation given the choice.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
