Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2
0  39  66  76
1  84  44  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with a consideration of their valuations, we will use the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Given the valuations:
- Agent 0 values items as follows: Item 0 = 39, Item 1 = 66, Item 2 = 76
- Agent 1 values items as follows: Item 0 = 84, Item 1 = 44, Item 2 = 51

A fair allocation should ensure that:
1. Each agent receives at least one item.
2. The allocation is envy-free as much as possible.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1, Item 1 to Agent 0, and Item 2 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0's allocation: Items 1 and 2, total value = 66 + 76 = 142
   - Agent 1's allocation: Item 0, total value = 84

2. Evaluate envy-freeness:
   - Agent 0 does not envy Agent 1 because the total value of items 1 and 2 (142) is greater than item 0's value (39) for Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 does not envy Agent 0 because item 0's value (84) for Agent 1 is higher than the combined value of items 1 and 2 (44 + 51 = 95) for Agent 1.

Thus, this allocation is envy-free and fair.

Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
