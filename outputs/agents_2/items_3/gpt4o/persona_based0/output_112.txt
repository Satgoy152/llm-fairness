Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2
0  32  26  91
1  21  86  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that minimizes envy and maximizes their total valuation. Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0: 32, Item 1: 26, Item 2: 91
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0: 21, Item 1: 86, Item 2: 95

We aim to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. 

To achieve this, we can follow a strategy that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's analyze each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it higher (32 vs. 21)
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it higher (86 vs. 26)
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it higher (95 vs. 91)

Thus, a possible allocation that respects the above preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item could be:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0
- Assign Items 1 and 2 to Agent 1

This allocation respects the rule that each agent should have an integer number of items, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
