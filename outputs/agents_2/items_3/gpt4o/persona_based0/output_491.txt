Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2
0  23  64  90
1  53  16  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 3 items to the 2 agents in such a way that achieves fairness and minimizes envy. The concept of envy-freeness in fair division ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

First, let's examine the valuation matrix:

```
    Items
    0   1   2
0  23  64  90
1  53  16  70
```

Agent 0 values the items as follows:
- Item 0: 23
- Item 1: 64
- Item 2: 90

Agent 1 values the items as follows:
- Item 0: 53
- Item 1: 16
- Item 2: 70

To minimize envy, we aim to give each agent items they value highly.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values this item at 90, which is the highest valuation for this item.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values this item at 53, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 23.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values this item at 64, while Agent 1 values it at 16.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.

This allocation is envy-free because:
- Agent 0 receives their highest valued item (item 2) and another item they value (item 1).
- Agent 1 receives an item they value higher than Agent 0 (item 0).

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items, and the total number of items allocated is 3.
