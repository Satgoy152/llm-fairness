Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2
0  51  58  97
1   9  60  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 9 60 18]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. With two agents and three items, one approach is to allocate items such that each agent feels they are receiving the maximum value possible given the constraints.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 51     | 58     | 97     |
| 1     | 9      | 60     | 18     |

### Calculating Total Valuations:
- Agent 0: Total Valuation = 51 + 58 + 97 = 206
- Agent 1: Total Valuation = 9 + 60 + 18 = 87

### Allocating the Items:
1. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item at 97, which is the highest single valuation among all items for both agents. Therefore, allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
   
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item at 60, which is significantly higher than their valuation of other items, and it's higher than what Agent 0 values it at. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 0**: This leaves Item 0, which Agent 0 values at 51 and Agent 1 values at 9. To maximize the total satisfaction and maintain envy-freeness, allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the distribution is envy-free based on their valuations.

### JSON Representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
