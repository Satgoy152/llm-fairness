Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2
0  97   5  91
1  98  92  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The key is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly relative to their preferences and in a way that minimizes envy.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [97, 5, 91]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [98, 92, 33]

Let's analyze the best way to allocate these items:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 97.
   - Agent 1 values it at 98.
   - Agent 1 has a slightly higher valuation, so it makes sense for Agent 1 to receive this item.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 5.
   - Agent 1 values it at 92.
   - Agent 1 has a much higher valuation for this item, so it should be allocated to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 91.
   - Agent 1 values it at 33.
   - Agent 0 values this item significantly more than Agent 1, so it should go to Agent 0.

Accordingly, the allocation can be made as follows:

- Agent 0 receives Item 2.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value the most highly, thereby minimizing envy. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
