Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2
0   0  60  50
1  75  90  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we consider the valuations and aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close as possible given the constraints.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 0
  - Item 1: 60
  - Item 2: 50

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 20

A potential envy-free allocation is one where each agent receives the items they value the most, or at least do not envy the allocation of the other. However, given the constraint of integer allocation and the fact that there are two agents and three items, one agent will receive two items, and the other agent will receive one item.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Allocation A:**
   - Agent 0 receives item 1.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

   Valuation:
   - Agent 0: 60
   - Agent 1: 75 + 20 = 95

2. **Allocation B:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 1 receives item 0.

   Valuation:
   - Agent 0: 60 + 50 = 110
   - Agent 1: 75

3. **Allocation C:**
   - Agent 0 receives item 2.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.

   Valuation:
   - Agent 0: 50
   - Agent 1: 75 + 90 = 165

Looking at these allocations, Allocation B seems to be the most balanced given the constraints, as it gives Agent 0 a higher utility from their allocation while still allowing Agent 1 to receive the item they value the most (Item 0).

Therefore, the chosen allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
