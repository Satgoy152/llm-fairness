Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2
0  22  88  64
1  22  91  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that they have received the best possible allocation from their perspective, given their valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 22
  - Item 1: 88
  - Item 2: 64

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 22
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 41

The goal is to allocate all three items in a way that is as fair as possible.

Let's try the following allocation:

1. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1: 
   - This is because Agent 1 values Item 1 most highly (91).

2. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0:
   - This is because Agent 0 values Item 2 more highly than Agent 0 values Item 0.

3. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0:
   - Since Agent 0 now has Item 2, which they value at 64, adding Item 0 (valued at 22) gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 86 for the items they receive.

Now let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 has received items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 has received item 1.

Both agents receive a valuation that is the highest possible given the allocation of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives the fairest possible allocation based on their valuations.
