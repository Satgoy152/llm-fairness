Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2
0  11  74  26
1  98  70  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we want to consider the concept of envy-freeness. In this context, envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 11, Item 1 = 74, Item 2 = 26
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 98, Item 1 = 70, Item 2 = 73

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 11
   - Agent 1 values it at 98
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 as they have a much higher valuation for it.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 74
   - Agent 1 values it at 70
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 as they have a slightly higher valuation for it.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 26
   - Agent 1 values it at 73
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 as they have a higher valuation for it.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value the most highly, given the constraints. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
