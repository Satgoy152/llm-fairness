Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2
0  71  56   3
1  62   3  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim to allocate items in such a way that minimizes envy between the agents. The agents' valuations for each item are as follows:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 71
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 2: 3

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 62
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 10

A simple approach to ensuring envy-freeness is to allocate items such that each agent believes they have received a set of items equivalent or better in value compared to the other agent's allocation.

One possible allocation strategy is:
- Assign the item with the highest valuation for each agent to that agent, and then allocate the remaining item in a way that maintains the balance.

1. Agent 0 highly values Item 0 (71) and Item 1 (56), but values Item 2 very low (3).
2. Agent 1 highly values Item 0 (62) and values Item 2 slightly better than Item 1.

Given these preferences, we can allocate:
- Agent 0 receives Item 0 (71).
- Agent 1 receives Item 2 (10).
- The remaining Item 1 (56) can be given to Agent 0, as Agent 1 values it very low (3).

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 127 (71 for Item 0 and 56 for Item 1) and Agent 1 a total value of 10 (for Item 2). While this does not perfectly equalize the perceived value, it ensures each agent gets items they value highly without feeling envious since Agent 0 receives the items they value most, and Agent 1 at least receives an item they value more than the alternative.

Here's how the allocation can be expressed in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
