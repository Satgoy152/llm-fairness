Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2
0  77  36  13
1  13  77  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 77 24]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy, ideally finding an envy-free solution or minimizing envy as much as possible.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 77
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 13

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 13
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 24

A straightforward approach is to ensure each agent receives at least one of their higher-valued items. We can try to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's utility while attempting to minimize envy.

Let's analyze the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0** prefers:
   - Item 0 the most, followed by Item 1, then Item 2.
   
2. **Agent 1** prefers:
   - Item 1 the most, followed by Item 2, then Item 0.

Based on these preferences, we can try the following allocation:

- Give Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Give Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Give Item 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (value 77).
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2 (values 77 and 24 respectively, totaling 101).

Both agents receive their most valued item. Agent 0 has his highest valued item, and Agent 1 receives the item of highest value to them and an additional item.

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
