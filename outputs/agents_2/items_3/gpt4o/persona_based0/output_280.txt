Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2
0  45  58  33
1  29  83  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent feels they receive a fair share based on their valuations. One desirable property is envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's consider the valuations:
- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 45, Item 1 = 58, Item 2 = 33.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 29, Item 1 = 83, Item 2 = 92.

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we look for a distribution where each agent feels they got the best possible bundle given the constraints.

One possible allocation:
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Items 0 and 2 to Agent 1.

Let's verify:
- Agent 0's valuation for Item 1: 58.
- Agent 1's valuation for Items 0 and 2: 29 + 92 = 121.

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 values their own allocation (58) more than any other single item.
- Agent 1 values their own allocation (121) more than any other single item or combination of items Agent 0 has.

This allocation is fair based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
