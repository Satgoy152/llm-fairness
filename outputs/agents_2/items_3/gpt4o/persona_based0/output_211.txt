Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2
0   2   6  48
1  30  17  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents while minimizing envy, we should consider the valuations provided by each agent for every item. The goal is to achieve a division where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

The table of valuations is as follows:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   2    |   6    |   48   |
|   1   |  30    |  17    |   66   |

The total valuations for each agent are:

- Agent 0: 2 + 6 + 48 = 56
- Agent 1: 30 + 17 + 66 = 113

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Item 2** has the highest valuation for both agents, with Agent 0 valuing it at 48 and Agent 1 valuing it at 66. Allocating Item 2 to Agent 1 maximizes the total value for that agent.

2. **Item 0** is valued at 30 by Agent 1 and only 2 by Agent 0. Allocating Item 0 to Agent 1 will further increase their total value significantly without much loss to Agent 0.

3. **Item 1** is the remaining item. It is valued at 6 by Agent 0 and 17 by Agent 1. Allocating Item 1 to Agent 0 helps ensure they receive something, slightly balancing the distribution of total perceived value.

### Final Allocation

- **Agent 0** receives Item 1.
- **Agent 1** receives Item 0 and Item 2.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive at least one item and the allocation is envy-minimized based on the relative valuations.

### JSON Representation

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation respects the requirement that all items are allocated, and each agent is accounted for in the distribution.
