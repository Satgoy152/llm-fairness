Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2
0   3  44   1
1  39  90  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and integer allocations, we need to evaluate each agent's preferences for the items. Here are the valuations provided:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 3
  - Item 1: 44
  - Item 2: 1

- Agent 1's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 39
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 50

The goal is to allocate the items such that the division is as fair as possible. One common approach is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring no agent feels envious of the other's allocation.

Let's assess the best allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (90), which is significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation (44). It makes sense to allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

2. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest among the items, but since it is already allocated to Agent 1, we should consider the next best option for Agent 0. Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 0 (valued at 3), while Agent 1 values item 0 at 39. Given the context, allocating item 0 to Agent 0 might make sense to balance the allocations.

3. Item 2 is least valued by both agents, but it still must be allocated. Agent 1's valuation (50) for item 2 is higher than Agent 0's (1), so it is reasonable to allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

Therefore, the allocation that appears most balanced, considering both the agents' valuations and the need to allocate all items, is:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the highest possible value from the available items, given the constraint that each item must be allocated to one agent.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
