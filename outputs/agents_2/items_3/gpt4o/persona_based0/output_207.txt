Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2
0  28   7   8
1  82  44  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints of integer item allocations.

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 28
  - Item 1: 7
  - Item 2: 8

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 82
  - Item 1: 44
  - Item 2: 27

The goal is to allocate all 3 items to the agents such that the allocation is fair.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 significantly higher than Agent 0 (82 vs 28). 
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 higher than Agent 0 (44 vs 7).
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 slightly higher than Agent 1 (8 vs 27).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent the items they value most, given the constraints.

**Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all three items are allocated, with Agent 1 receiving two items that they value highly, and Agent 0 receiving one item.
