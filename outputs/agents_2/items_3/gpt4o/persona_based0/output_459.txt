Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2
0  84  52   8
1   6  53  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to it as possible. This means that each agent should not prefer the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own bundle.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 84, Item 1 = 52, Item 2 = 8.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 6, Item 1 = 53, Item 2 = 53.

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation, minimizing any potential envy.

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 has a significantly higher valuation (84) compared to Agent 1 (6). Therefore, it is reasonable to allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values Item 1 higher (53) than Agent 0 (52), but the difference is marginal. To balance the allocation and to consider envy-freeness, we can allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: Both agents value Item 2 equally at 53. Given that Agent 1 already received Item 1, which they value highly, and to ensure Agent 0 doesn't end up with too little value, we can allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Item 0 and Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share according to their valuations, with minimal envy.
