Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2
0  72  45  75
1  42  50  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 72
  - Item 1: 45
  - Item 2: 75

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 42
  - Item 1: 50
  - Item 2: 86

We want to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share.

### Approach

1. **Maximize Total Valuation**: We aim to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is as high as possible. This is often a good strategy for achieving envy-freeness.

2. **Envy-Freeness**: We allocate items such that no agent would prefer to swap their allocation with another's based on their own valuations.

### Allocation Steps

- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values this item the most (86 vs. 75). So, allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item higher than Agent 1 (72 vs. 42). So, allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: The remaining item should be allocated to the agent who would appreciate it more based on remaining allocations. Agent 1 values Item 1 higher (50 vs. 45), so allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations

- Agent 0 receives Item 0.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, considering the constraints.

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation is designed to be envy-free given the valuations provided, as each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations.
