Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2
0  78  65  40
1  78  22  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-free allocations ensure that each agent feels they received at least as much value as they perceive in any other agent's allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 65
  - Item 2: 40
  
- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 22
  - Item 2: 57

An analysis of potential allocations could be:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, with a total valuation of 78 + 65 = 143.
- Agent 1 receives item 2, with a total valuation of 57.

This allocation minimizes envy as follows:

- Agent 0's total valuation for their items (143) is higher than their valuation for Agent 1's item 2 (40).
- Agent 1 receives their highest valued item (57), and their valuation for the items they don't receive (item 0 and 1) is 78 and 22, respectively. They prefer item 2 over item 1.

Although Agent 1 might envy Agent 0â€™s total value (143), the allocation ensures that each agent perceives they received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
