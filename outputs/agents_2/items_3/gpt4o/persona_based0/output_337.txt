Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2
0   3  15  72
1  66  72  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to achieve envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  |
|------------|----|----|----|
| 0          | 3  | 15 | 72 |
| 1          | 66 | 72 | 56 |

Let's consider different allocation scenarios and evaluate them for envy-freeness:

**Scenario 1:**
- Agent 0 receives items: [2]
- Agent 1 receives items: [0, 1]

Valuations for this scenario:
- Agent 0's valuation: 72 (for item 2)
- Agent 1's valuation: 66 (for item 0) + 72 (for item 1) = 138

In this scenario, each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the items the other agent receives:
- Agent 0 values item 2 at 72, which is higher than valuing items 0 and 1 combined at 18.
- Agent 1 values items 0 and 1 combined at 138, which is higher than valuing item 2 at 56.

Therefore, this allocation is envy-free.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
