Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2
0  78  71  44
1  75  48  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will evaluate the total valuation each agent has for the items and aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction. Envy-freeness in this context means that, given their own allocation, no agent would prefer to have the allocation of the other agent.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 78 (for item 0) + 71 (for item 1) + 44 (for item 2) = 193
- Agent 1's total valuation: 75 (for item 0) + 48 (for item 1) + 32 (for item 2) = 155

One possible fair allocation is to maximize each agent's relative satisfaction with their allocated items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 since they value it the most (78 vs. 75).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 as they have a significantly higher valuation (71 vs. 48).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 since their valuation is lower for the other items, and this gives them something.

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives items they highly value, and Agent 1 receives an item, reducing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
