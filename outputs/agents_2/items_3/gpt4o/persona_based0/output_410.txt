Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2
0  63  62  29
1  31   1  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means each agent feels they received a bundle of items at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations provided in the table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 63     | 62     | 29     |
| 1     | 31     | 1      | 90     |

Agent 0 values:
- Item 0: 63
- Item 1: 62
- Item 2: 29

Agent 1 values:
- Item 0: 31
- Item 1: 1
- Item 2: 90

The goal is to fairly allocate the three items between the two agents. One approach is to maximize the minimum satisfaction for the agents or try to find an allocation where neither agent envies the other significantly.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 1 since it's highly valued by them (90) and less valued by Agent 0 (29).
2. **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 0 as it has the highest valuation (63) for Agent 0 compared to Agent 1 (31).
3. **Item 1**: Since Agent 0 already has Item 0, and Agent 1’s valuation of Item 1 is minimal (1), it’s more balanced to allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 to maximize their total valuation without significantly increasing Agent 1's envy.

### Final Allocations
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.

Agent 0's total valuation: 63 (Item 0) + 62 (Item 1) = 125
Agent 1's total valuation: 90 (Item 2)

Although this allocation isn't perfectly envy-free, it respects the given valuations and aims to provide a fair distribution based on the available data.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
