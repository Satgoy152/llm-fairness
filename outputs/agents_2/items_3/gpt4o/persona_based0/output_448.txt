Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2
0  31  27   3
1  55  76  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents, we can employ the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or ensuring that no agent envies the other. One potential way to allocate the items is by calculating the total value each agent assigns to each possible allocation and then selecting the allocation that maximizes fairness.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: Item 0 = 31, Item 1 = 27, Item 2 = 3
- Agent 1's valuations: Item 0 = 55, Item 1 = 76, Item 2 = 97

To allocate items fairly, we can consider the following strategy:

1. **Agent 1** values Item 2 the most (97) compared to Agent 0's valuation (3). Allocating Item 2 to Agent 1 minimizes potential envy since it is highly valued by Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values Item 0 at 31, which is their highest valuation compared to Item 1 (27) and Item 2 (3). Allocating Item 0 to Agent 0 leaves them with their most valuable item.
3. **Item 1** has a higher relative value to Agent 1 (76) than to Agent 0 (27). However, since Agent 0 only has one item so far, assigning Item 1 to Agent 0 balances the allocation and keeps Agent 0 from being envious.

Thus, we can assign the items as follows:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items, and the allocation is balanced in terms of maximizing each agent's satisfaction.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
