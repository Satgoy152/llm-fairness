Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2
0  31  65  15
1  33  85  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. Envy-freeness implies that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:  
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 65
  - Item 2: 15

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 49

A fair allocation can be achieved by considering the total value each agent places on the items and striving to equalize the perceived value of their allocations as much as possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation Process:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 the most (65).
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the most (85).

2. **Consider Allocation Options:**
   - Both agents highly value Item 1, but Agent 1 values it significantly more.
   - Next, Agent 0 values Item 0 more than Item 2, and Agent 1 also values Item 0 slightly more than Item 2.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as it is the highest valued item for both, but more so for Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it more than Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, balancing out the allocation by giving the remaining item.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.

This allocation considers the highest total perceived value for each agent, aiming to minimize envy.

{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
