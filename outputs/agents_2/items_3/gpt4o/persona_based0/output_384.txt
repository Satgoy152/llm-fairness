Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2
0  42  25  24
1  96  88  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim for an allocation that is envy-free if possible. An allocation is envy-free if every agent values their bundle at least as much as the bundle of any other agent.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 42
  - Item 1: 25
  - Item 2: 24

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 96
  - Item 1: 88
  - Item 2: 23

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can analyze the valuations and distribute items such that each agent's total valuation for their allocated items is maximized according to their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Item 2 (Valuation = 24)
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 1 (Valuation = 96 + 88 = 184)

This allocation is envy-free because:
- Agent 0 only has one item and values their bundle at 24, but cannot have a higher value by taking any other single item without exceeding the count of items.
- Agent 1 has a total valuation of 184 from their items, which is higher than 24, and they have no incentive to envy Agent 0's single item.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
