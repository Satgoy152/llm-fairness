Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2
0  89  51  77
1  29  91  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that considers envy-freeness, we need to look at the valuations each agent has for the items. We aim to allocate the items such that neither agent feels envious of the other, if possible.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 51
  - Item 2: 77

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 29
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 83

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0 gets Item 0, Agent 1 gets Item 1 and Item 2:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 89
   - Agent 1's total value: 91 + 83 = 174

2. **Agent 0 gets Item 2, Agent 1 gets Item 0 and Item 1:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 77
   - Agent 1's total value: 29 + 91 = 120

3. **Agent 0 gets Item 1 and Item 2, Agent 1 gets Item 0:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 51 + 77 = 128
   - Agent 1's total value: 29

4. **Agent 0 gets Item 0 and Item 2, Agent 1 gets Item 1:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 89 + 77 = 166
   - Agent 1's total value: 91

Considering the valuations, the allocation listed as number 1 is the best option for achieving fairness. In this allocation, each agent receives one of their most valued items, and while Agent 1 receives more total value, Agent 0 receives their highest valued single item, minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
