Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2
0   4  92  65
1  14  79  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive according to their individual valuations. Here's how the valuations look for each agent and item:

- Agent 0's valuations: [4, 92, 65]
- Agent 1's valuations: [14, 79, 63]

We'll look for an allocation that maximizes fairness, meaning that no agent feels envious of another's allocation. We can use a simple method of allocating each item to the agent who values it the most, but we'll ensure that each agent gets at least one item to balance the distribution as fairly as possible.

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 4
   - Agent 1 values it at 14
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (since 14 > 4)

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 92
   - Agent 1 values it at 79
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (since 92 > 79)

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 65
   - Agent 1 values it at 63
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (since 65 > 63)

This allocation gives Agent 0 two items (1 and 2) and Agent 1 one item (0). Both agents get an allocation based on their highest value preferences, which should minimize envy.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
