Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2
0  91  99  34
1  78  14  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility or value each agent receives from their allocation. The goal is to try to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [91, 99, 34]
- Agent 1: [78, 14, 73]

Let's consider possible allocations:

1. **Allocate based on highest individual valuations:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 91, and Agent 1 values it at 78. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 99, and Agent 1 values it at 14. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 34, and Agent 1 values it at 73. Assign to Agent 1.

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.

Valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0's total value: 91 + 99 = 190
- Agent 1's total value: 73

This allocation is envy-free because each agent receives the items they value the most compared to the other agent's allocation.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
