Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2
0  71  54  79
1  86  20  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations of the items, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. 

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0's valuations:
  - Item 0: 71
  - Item 1: 54
  - Item 2: 79

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 86
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 28

The goal is to allocate all 3 items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and preferably, each agent feels they are getting a fair share relative to their valuations.

A simple approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, which often leads to an envy-free solution:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 71
   - Agent 1 values it at 86
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (since 86 > 71)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 54
   - Agent 1 values it at 20
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (since 54 > 20)

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 79
   - Agent 1 values it at 28
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (since 79 > 28)

This allocation gives Agent 0 items 1 and 2, and Agent 1 item 0. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, which typically leads to a fair and envy-free division under the assumption that each agent's utility is solely based on their own valuations.
