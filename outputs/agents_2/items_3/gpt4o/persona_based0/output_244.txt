Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2
0  48  69  77
1  87  74  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of the agents' utilities while ensuring that no agent envies the other. Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2
0  48  69  77
1  87  74  10
```

Our goal is to allocate the three items between the two agents (agent 0 and agent 1) such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is envy-free if possible.

Let's consider the possible allocations and their implications:

1. **Agent 0 gets items with indices [0, 1] and Agent 1 gets item [2]:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 48 + 69 = 117
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 10

2. **Agent 0 gets items with indices [0, 2] and Agent 1 gets item [1]:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 48 + 77 = 125
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 74

3. **Agent 0 gets item with index [1] and Agent 1 gets items [0, 2]:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 69
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 87 + 10 = 97

4. **Agent 0 gets item with index [2] and Agent 1 gets items [0, 1]:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 77
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 87 + 74 = 161

Among these allocations, the third option minimizes envy because each agent receives an allocation that is more favorable to them than other possible allocations.

Therefore, the allocation that maximizes fairness and minimizes envy is:

- Agent 0 receives item [1]
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 2]

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
