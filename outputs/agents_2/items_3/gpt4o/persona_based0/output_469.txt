Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2
0  94  18  77
1  36  46  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents, we'll consider the concept of envy-freeness. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 94
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 77

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 83

The goal is to allocate the 3 items in such a way that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to their own valuations, and no agent envies the other.

### Analysis

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values this item at 94, while Agent 1 values it at 36. Agent 0 has a significantly higher valuation for this item.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values this item at 18, while Agent 1 values it at 46. Agent 1 has a higher valuation for this item.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values this item at 77, while Agent 1 values it at 83. Agent 1 has a slightly higher valuation for this item.

### Allocation Strategy

To ensure a fair and envy-free allocation:

- Assign **Item 0** to **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has a much higher valuation for this item compared to Agent 1.
- Assign **Item 1** to **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item higher than Agent 0 does.
- Assign **Item 2** to **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item slightly more than Agent 0 does.

This allocation results in the following:

- **Agent 0** receives Item 0, which they value highly.
- **Agent 1** receives Items 1 and 2, both of which they have higher valuations for compared to Agent 0.

This allocation should be envy-free as neither agent would prefer the allocation of the other given their own valuations.

### Final Allocation in JSON

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and both agents receive an allocation that reflects their preferences, minimizing envy.
