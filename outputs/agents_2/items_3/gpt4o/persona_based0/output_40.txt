Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2
0  83  24  94
1  21   0  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1) while ensuring envy-freeness, we must consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0: 83, Item 1: 24, Item 2: 94
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0: 21, Item 1: 0, Item 2: 70

One possible way to allocate the items fairly and ensure envy-freeness is by considering the highest value each agent places on the items and aiming to give them the items they value most while balancing the fairness.

Let's consider the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (value 94), and Agent 1 also values Item 2 highly (value 70). However, Agent 0's valuation is higher, so it's reasonable to allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 0's second highest valuation is for Item 0 (value 83), but this item is also valued by Agent 1 (value 21). Given that Agent 1 does not value Item 1 at all, it is better to allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. This leaves Item 0 for Agent 1.

Thus, a possible allocation that maintains fairness is:

- Agent 0 receives Items 2 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items in a manner that respects their valuations and minimizes envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0]
}
```
