Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2
0  51  39  58
1  38  42  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness ensures that each agent feels they have received an allocation at least as valuable as what they perceive others have received, based on their own valuations.

Here are the valuations for clarity:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 1: 39
  - Item 2: 58

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 38
  - Item 1: 42
  - Item 2: 35

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent receives at least one item and no agent feels envious of the other's allocation.

### Steps to Allocate:

1. **Item 2** has the highest valuation for both agents. However, it is valued more by Agent 0 (58) compared to Agent 1 (35). Thus, it is more efficient to allocate **Item 2** to Agent 0.

2. For **Item 0**, Agent 0 values it at 51 and Agent 1 values it at 38. It is more efficient to allocate **Item 0** to Agent 0 since it maximizes Agent 0's satisfaction, and Agent 1 has a better alternative.

3. **Item 1** is valued at 39 by Agent 0 and 42 by Agent 1. It is more efficient to allocate **Item 1** to Agent 1 as this maximizes Agent 1's satisfaction.

This allocation gives each agent their highest possible satisfaction given the constraint that each gets at least one item.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives item 1, which is their highest-valued remaining item.
