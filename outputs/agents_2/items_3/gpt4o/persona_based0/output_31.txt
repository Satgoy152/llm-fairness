Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2
0  79  23  59
1  90  90  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we want to aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 has valuations: [79, 23, 59]
- Agent 1 has valuations: [90, 90, 70]

One way to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences while ensuring no agent feels envious of the other's allocation. We can try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's total valuation.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it the highest at 90).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it the highest at 90).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it the highest at 59).

After this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 2, valued at 59.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1, valued at 90 each.

This allocation leaves Agent 0 with a total valuation of 59 and Agent 1 with a total valuation of 180, which is as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 3 items being allocated.
