Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2
0  70  55   7
1  42  26  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy or achieves an envy-free allocation if possible.

### Valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 70
  - Item 1: 55
  - Item 2: 7

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 42
  - Item 1: 26
  - Item 2: 26

### Total Valuations:

- Total value for Agent 0: 70 + 55 + 7 = 132
- Total value for Agent 1: 42 + 26 + 26 = 94

### Allocation Strategy:

To ensure a fair allocation, we need to consider how each item contributes to the total value perceived by each agent. A simple way to attempt to reduce envy is to give each agent the item(s) for which they have the highest relative valuation, while ensuring all items are allocated.

#### Possible Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 70 
   - Agent 1 values it at 42 
   - Allocate to Agent 0 as they value it higher.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 55 
   - Agent 1 values it at 26 
   - Allocate to Agent 0 as they value it higher.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 7 
   - Agent 1 values it at 26 
   - Allocate to Agent 1 as they value it higher.

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items they value most (items 0 and 1) and Agent 1 the item they value more than Agent 0 (item 2). This allocation minimizes envy.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
