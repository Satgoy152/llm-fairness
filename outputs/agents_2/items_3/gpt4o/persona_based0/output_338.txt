Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2
0  95  95  20
1  45  50  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 95  
  - Item 1: 95  
  - Item 2: 20  

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 45  
  - Item 1: 50  
  - Item 2: 76  

A fair allocation should consider each agent's total valuation of their allocated items.

One possible fair allocation is:

1. Allocate Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

This results in:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 95 (Item 0) + 95 (Item 1) = 190
- Agent 1's total valuation: 76 (Item 2)

Agent 0 receives items with a high valuation according to their preferences, and Agent 1 receives their highest-valued item, Item 2. This allocation is envy-free because:

- Agent 0 values their allocation (190) higher than the value they would get from Agent 1's allocation (76).
- Agent 1 values their allocation (76) higher than the value they would get from Agent 0's allocation (45 or 50).

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
