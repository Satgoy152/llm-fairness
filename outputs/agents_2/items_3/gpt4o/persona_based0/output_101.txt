Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2
0  66  76  56
1  28  28  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free—or as close as possible—given the integer constraint on the number of items each agent can receive. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we might approach this scenario:

1. **Valuation Matrix**:
   - Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 66, Item 1 at 76, Item 2 at 56.
   - Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 28, Item 1 at 28, Item 2 at 26.

2. **Total Valuation Calculation**:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 66 + 76 + 56 = 198.
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 28 + 28 + 26 = 82.

3. **Fair Allocation Objective**:
   - We want to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share, ideally without envy.
   - Agent 0 has higher valuations on all items compared to Agent 1.

4. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Given that Agent 0 has significantly higher valuations, a straightforward approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the total valuation each agent receives, while also considering fairness.

5. **Proposed Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1 (valued at 66 and 76 respectively, total = 142).
   - Agent 1 receives item 2 (valued at 26).

This allocation gives Agent 0 the highest valued items they prefer, while Agent 1 receives at least one item, minimizing potential envy given the constraints.

**Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents as per their preferences, considering their valuations.
