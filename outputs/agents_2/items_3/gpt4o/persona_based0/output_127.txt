Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2
0  17  24  61
1  59  53  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that ensures envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Here's a breakdown of the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 17
  - Item 1: 24
  - Item 2: 61

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 53
  - Item 2: 94

We want to allocate all three items such that each agent feels that they have received a fair share according to their own valuations. One common approach to achieving a fair allocation is to maximize the minimum valuation each agent gets from the items they receive, thereby reducing potential envy.

Let's consider possible allocations:

1. **Allocation 1:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0]
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 2]

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 17
   - Agent 1: 53 + 94 = 147

2. **Allocation 2:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 2]

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 24
   - Agent 1: 59 + 94 = 153

3. **Allocation 3:**
   - Agent 0: Items [2]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 1]

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 61
   - Agent 1: 59 + 53 = 112

4. **Allocation 4:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
   - Agent 1: Items [2]

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 17 + 24 = 41
   - Agent 1: 94

5. **Allocation 5:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
   - Agent 1: Items [1]

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 17 + 61 = 78
   - Agent 1: 53

6. **Allocation 6:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
   - Agent 1: Items [0]

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 24 + 61 = 85
   - Agent 1: 59

Among these allocations, Allocation 6 seems to be a fair choice. Agent 0 receives items [1, 2] with a combined valuation of 85, while Agent 1 receives item [0] with a valuation of 59. While Agent 0 has a higher valuation, this allocation minimizes the potential for envy since Agent 1 receives their highest valued item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
