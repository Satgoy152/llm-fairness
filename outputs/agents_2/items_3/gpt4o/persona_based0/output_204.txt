Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2
0  46  35  78
1  71  62  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation where both agents feel that they are receiving a fair share based on their valuations. One approach to achieve fairness is to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, meaning no agent prefers the items allocated to the other agent over their own allocation.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 46
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 78

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 71
  - Item 1: 62
  - Item 2: 83

We will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to their valuations.

One possible allocation is as follows:

- Allocate Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

Let's evaluate this allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Allocation**:
   - Item 2: Value is 78.
   - Total value for Agent 0: 78.

2. **Agent 1's Allocation**:
   - Item 0: Value is 71.
   - Item 1: Value is 62.
   - Total value for Agent 1: 71 + 62 = 133.

By this allocation, Agent 0 receives their highest valued item (Item 2) and Agent 1 receives the two other items, which collectively offer them a higher total value than they would get by swapping for Agent 0's item.

Both agents receive items that maximize their utility given the constraints, and neither agent prefers the other's allocation over their own. Thus, this allocation can be considered envy-free.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
