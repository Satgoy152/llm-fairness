Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2
0   8  83  82
1  13  33  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1), we need to consider their valuations and aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. 

Let's examine the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 8      | 83     | 82     |
| 1     | 13     | 33     | 73     |

Given these valuations, we will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives the highest possible total value from their perspective, while also aiming to keep the distribution fair.

1. Agent 0 highly values Item 1 (83) and Item 2 (82) but values Item 0 (8) the least.
2. Agent 1 values Item 2 the most (73) followed by Item 1 (33) and Item 0 (13).

A fair distribution could be:

- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 since they value it the most (83).
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 since it's their highest-valued item (73).
- Now, only Item 0 remains. Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 (13 vs 8). To balance the allocations and minimize overall envy, allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

The allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 2

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 a total value of 83.
- Agent 1 a total value of 86 (13 + 73).

This distribution minimizes envy, as each agent receives an item they highly value, and the leftover item is allocated to the agent who values it more.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
