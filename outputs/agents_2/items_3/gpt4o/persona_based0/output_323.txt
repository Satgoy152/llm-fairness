Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2
0  84  18  32
1  17  31  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the integer allocation constraint. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: Item 0 = 84, Item 1 = 18, Item 2 = 32
- Agent 1 values items as follows: Item 0 = 17, Item 1 = 31, Item 2 = 59

Let's try to find an allocation that minimizes envy:

One possible approach is to allocate items based on each agent's highest valued items while ensuring all items are distributed.

1. **Agent 0’s preferences (in descending order):** Item 0 (84), Item 2 (32), Item 1 (18)
2. **Agent 1’s preferences (in descending order):** Item 2 (59), Item 1 (31), Item 0 (17)

Let's try to assign the highest valued items to each agent:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0** because it's their highest valued item.
2. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1** because it's their highest valued item.
3. The remaining item, Item 1, should be allocated to Agent 1 to balance preferences (since Agent 1 values Item 1 higher than Agent 0 does).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and it attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent their most valued item(s) considering integer constraints.
