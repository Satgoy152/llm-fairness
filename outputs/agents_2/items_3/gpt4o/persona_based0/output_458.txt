Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2
0  79  29  35
1  19  50   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that envy-freeness is considered, we should look for a distribution where each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's the table of valuations again for clarity:

```
    Item
    0   1   2
0  79  29  35
1  19  50   9
```

One approach to achieving a fair allocation is to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation. We can do this by considering the highest valuation preferences for each agent.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 because it has the highest value for agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 because it has the highest value for agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as it provides more value to agent 0 than to agent 1, and agent 0 does not envy agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, with total valuation: 79 + 35 = 114.
- Agent 1 receives item 1, with total valuation: 50.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of their valuation, and neither agent envies the other's allocation. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
