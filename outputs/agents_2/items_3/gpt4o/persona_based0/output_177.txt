Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2
0   3  91  69
1  83  74   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 3 91 69]
 [83 74  6]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

The valuation matrix is as follows:

```
Agent 0: [3, 91, 69]
Agent 1: [83, 74, 6]
```

Let's analyze the situation:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 1 (91) and item 2 (69).
- **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (83) and item 1 (74).

To achieve fairness, we can consider the following allocation:

1. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item the most (91), and this allocation significantly reduces potential envy.
2. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item the most (83), providing a high utility.
3. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: This item is valued more by Agent 0 (69) than by Agent 1 (6).

This allocation aims to make both agents as satisfied as possible within the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
