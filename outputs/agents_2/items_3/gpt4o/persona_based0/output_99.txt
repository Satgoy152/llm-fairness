Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2
0  20  20  76
1  10  77  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation based on their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations presented:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 20
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 76

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 73

We need to allocate each of the three items to one of the two agents such that neither agent envies the allocation of the other.

To start, let's evaluate the total valuation each agent would have if they received each item:

1. **Agent 0's total valuation if they receive:**
   - Item 0: 20
   - Item 1: 20
   - Item 2: 76

2. **Agent 1's total valuation if they receive:**
   - Item 0: 10
   - Item 1: 77
   - Item 2: 73

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we need to consider the items that each agent values the most while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation:

- Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (76), followed by Items 0 and 1 equally (20 each).
- Agent 1 values Item 1 the most (77), followed by Item 2 (73) and then Item 0 (10).

Based on this, a possible envy-free allocation is:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that:

- Agent 0 receives Item 2 (their highest valued item) and Item 0 (valued at 20).
- Agent 1 receives Item 1 (their highest valued item).

Now, neither agent envies the other because each agent receives their most valued item, and Agent 0 receives an additional item that does not diminish the overall satisfaction for Agent 1.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and it respects the valuations of each agent, providing an envy-free distribution.
