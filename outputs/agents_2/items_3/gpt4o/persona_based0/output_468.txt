Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2
0  91  95  95
1  59  46  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [59 46 16]]
Output:
In this scenario, we are tasked with fairly allocating the items to the agents based on their valuations, while ensuring envy-freeness. The goal is to allocate all items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation, given their own valuations.

### Valuations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 91
  - Item 1: 95
  - Item 2: 95

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 16

### Observations:

1. **Agent 0** has higher valuations for all items compared to **Agent 1**.
2. **Agent 1** places the highest value on Item 0.

### Possible Allocation Strategy:

To achieve a fair allocation, we can consider the following strategy:

- Assign Item 0 to **Agent 1** because it holds the highest value for them compared to the other items.
- Assign Items 1 and 2 to **Agent 0** because this maximizes their valuation without causing envy from **Agent 1**.

### Allocation Justification:

- **Agent 0** gets Items 1 and 2, which are valued at 95 each. Total valuation for Agent 0 is 190.
- **Agent 1** gets Item 0, which is valued at 59. Even though Agent 1's total valuation is lower, they do not envy Agent 0 because they are receiving their highest valued item available to them.

Thus, this allocation ensures that both agents receive items in a way that is consistent with their preferences and eliminates envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
