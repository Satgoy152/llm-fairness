Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2
0  25  22   9
1   3   2  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the principle of envy-freeness, where each agent should prefer their allocation over the other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 = 25, Item 1 = 22, Item 2 = 9
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 = 3, Item 1 = 2, Item 2 = 18

To ensure a fair division where each agent receives an integer number of items (and all items are allocated), we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify the highest valued item for each agent**:
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (value 25)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (value 18)

2. **Allocate the most preferred items to each agent**:
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate the remaining item**:
   - The remaining item is Item 1.
   - Compare the valuations of Item 1 for both agents:
     - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 22.
     - Agent 1 values Item 1 at 2.
   - Since Agent 0 values Item 1 more, allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value more highly, reducing the potential for envy.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets Item 2.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
