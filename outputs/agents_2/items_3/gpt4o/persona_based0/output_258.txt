Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2
0  25  32  43
1  85  70  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. An envy-free allocation means that each agent should feel that they received a bundle of items that is at least as good as any other agent's bundle, according to their own valuation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 25
  - Item 1: 32
  - Item 2: 43

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 85
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 2: 61

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share. We can follow a simple procedure of maximizing each agent's total valuation of their allocated items.

1. Agent 1 has a strong preference for Item 0, as they value it at 85, which is the highest single valuation for any item by any agent.
2. Agent 0 values Item 2 the most at 43, so it might be reasonable to allocate this item to them.
3. The remaining item, Item 1, should be allocated in a way that maximizes fairness. Agent 1 values Item 1 at 70, which is the next highest preference for this item. Giving Item 1 to Agent 1 would maximize their total valuation.

Thus, the allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives Item 2.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1.

This allocation should be relatively fair, as it gives Agent 1 the items they value most highly (Items 0 and 1), and Agent 0 receives Item 2, which they value most highly.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
