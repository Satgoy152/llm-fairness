Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2
0  52  57  36
1  41  81  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the preferences of each agent. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as any other agent values their own bundle, whenever possible.

Given the table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 52     | 57     | 36     |
| 1     | 41     | 81     | 85     |

We look at the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 52 (Item 0) + 57 (Item 1) + 36 (Item 2) = 145
- Agent 1: 41 (Item 0) + 81 (Item 1) + 85 (Item 2) = 207

A fair allocation should consider the possibility of each agent getting at least one item they highly value. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest (85 vs. 36). So, allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 also values Item 1 quite high (81 vs. 57). Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 0**: This leaves Item 0, which both agents value relatively high, but Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 1 (52 vs. 41). Thus, allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, and the allocation is envy-free under the constraints of integer allocations.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
