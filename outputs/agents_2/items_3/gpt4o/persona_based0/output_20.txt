Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2
0  84  93  71
1  19  62  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim for an envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the allocation of items given to another agent more than their own.

Let's consider the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [84, 93, 71]
- Agent 1's valuations: [19, 62, 35]

We need to allocate the three items (0, 1, and 2) to the two agents (0 and 1). 

One approach to achieving fairness is to maximize the minimum value that each agent receives, often referred to as the "maximin" approach. We'll aim to allocate the items to maximize the minimum value each agent receives from their allocated items.

Let's go through the possible allocations:

1. **Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives item 1.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

   Valuations for this allocation:
   - Agent 0: 93 (from item 1)
   - Agent 1: 19 + 35 = 54 (from items 0 and 2)

   This allocation gives Agent 0 more value from their single item than Agent 1 receives from their two items, but Agent 1's allocation still respects Agent 0's preferences.

2. **Test for envy-freeness:**
   - Agent 0 has a value of 93 for their allocation and would not prefer Agent 1's allocation (54).
   - Agent 1 has a value of 54 for their allocation and would not prefer Agent 0's allocation (93).

This allocation is envy-free because neither agent prefers the other's allocation more than their own.

Thus, the fair and envy-free allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
