Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2
0  42  33  91
1  89  93  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 93 37]]
Output:
To allocate items fairly between the two agents, we need to ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation, given their valuations. This is commonly referred to as an envy-free allocation. Let's first inspect the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 42
  - Item 1: 33
  - Item 2: 91

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 93
  - Item 2: 37

Given these valuations, we aim to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy. One way to achieve this is to allocate items based on maximizing the sum of values for each agent. Let's examine potential allocations:

1. **Allocation 1**:
   - Agent 0: [2]  (Value = 91)
   - Agent 1: [0, 1] (Value = 89 + 93 = 182)

2. **Allocation 2**:
   - Agent 0: [0, 2] (Value = 42 + 91 = 133)
   - Agent 1: [1] (Value = 93)

3. **Allocation 3**:
   - Agent 0: [1, 2] (Value = 33 + 91 = 124)
   - Agent 1: [0] (Value = 89)

Among these allocations, Allocation 1 is favorable because:

- Agent 0 receives item 2, which they value the most.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1, which combined have the highest value for them compared to any other allocation.

This allocation reduces envy by providing each agent with items they value highly.

Now, let's present the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
