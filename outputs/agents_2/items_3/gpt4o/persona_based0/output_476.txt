Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2
0  93  81  20
1  81  90  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 90 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy, where each agent values their allocated items as much as or more than the items allocated to the other agent.

Given the valuation matrix:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  |
|------------|----|----|----|
| 0          | 93 | 81 | 20 |
| 1          | 81 | 90 | 99 |

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. **Allocation 1:**
   - Agent 0 receives items [0, 1]
   - Agent 1 receives item [2]

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 93 (item 0) + 81 (item 1) = 174
   - Agent 1: 99 (item 2)

   Here, Agent 0 values their allocation higher than Agent 1's (174 vs. 99), and Agent 1 values their allocation higher than any single item from Agent 0's allocation.

2. **Allocation 2:**
   - Agent 0 receives items [0]
   - Agent 1 receives items [1, 2]

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 93
   - Agent 1: 90 (item 1) + 99 (item 2) = 189

   In this allocation, Agent 1 values their allocation significantly higher than Agent 0's, which might not be ideal for fairness since Agent 0 could feel envious.

3. **Allocation 3:**
   - Agent 0 receives item [1]
   - Agent 1 receives items [0, 2]

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 81
   - Agent 1: 81 (item 0) + 99 (item 2) = 180

   Here, Agent 0 might feel envious of Agent 1's allocation.

After evaluating these allocations, Allocation 1 appears to be the most envy-free and fair under the given valuations. Agent 0 receives items they value highly, and Agent 1 receives an item they value as the highest.

Therefore, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
