Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2
0  86   2  14
1  98  87  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. In this context, envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the allocation of items given to the other agent over their own allocation.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 86, Item 1 = 2, Item 2 = 14.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 98, Item 1 = 87, Item 2 = 20.

To achieve a fair allocation, we should allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction given their respective valuations. We can use a simple method where we allocate the highest valued item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through this step by step:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 86.
   - Agent 1 values it at 98.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (since 98 > 86).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 2.
   - Agent 1 values it at 87.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (since 87 > 2).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 14.
   - Agent 1 values it at 20.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (since 20 > 14).

In this allocation, all items are given to Agent 1. This allocation maximizes total satisfaction based on the agents' valuations, but it leaves Agent 0 with nothing. To ensure that Agent 0 receives at least one item, let's adjust slightly:

1. **Item 0** remains allocated to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
2. **Item 1** remains allocated to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
3. **Item 2** is allocated to Agent 0 to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free but ensures both agents receive items, while Agent 1 retains the majority of high-value items based on the given valuations.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
