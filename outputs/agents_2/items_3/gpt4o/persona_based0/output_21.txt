Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2
0  85  19  85
1  68  31  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'd ideally like to ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation, based on their valuations. This is the concept of envy-freeness.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 85
  - Item 1: 19
  - Item 2: 85

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 68
  - Item 1: 31
  - Item 2: 94

We need to allocate all three items such that no agent envies the other.

One possible approach is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that we distribute items fairly.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values items 0 and 2 equally at 85.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 94.

2. **Assign High-Valuation Items:**
   - Give item 2 to Agent 1 since it's their highest-valued item, and they value it more than Agent 0 does (94 vs. 85).
   - This leaves us with items 0 and 1 to distribute.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 highly (85), whereas Agent 1 values it at 68.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 has a higher valuation for it.
   - The remaining item, item 1, should go to Agent 0 to balance the number of items, as Agent 0 values it at 19 and Agent 1 values it at 31. This is a less significant item in terms of value, so it should go to Agent 0 to maintain balance in the number of items allocated.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 1
- **Agent 1:** Item 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that Agent 1 gets the item they value the most, while Agent 0 receives two items they value moderately and significantly.

{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
