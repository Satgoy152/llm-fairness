Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2
0  96  18  78
1  89  56  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 56 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total utility or value for each agent and also ensure that the allocation is envy-free, if possible. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [96, 18, 78]
- Agent 1: [89, 56, 85]

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. We can consider each item and determine which agent values it more.

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 96
   - Agent 1 values it at 89
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. Item 1: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 18
   - Agent 1 values it at 56
   - Allocate to Agent 1

3. Item 2: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 78
   - Agent 1 values it at 85
   - Allocate to Agent 1

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it more, maximizing the overall valuation for each agent. The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 0
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
