Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2
0  52   6  19
1  53  17  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate items fairly, we aim to achieve an envy-free division where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the provided valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: Item 0 = 52, Item 1 = 6, Item 2 = 19
- Agent 1's valuations: Item 0 = 53, Item 1 = 17, Item 2 = 60

We want to allocate the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the allocation respects the envy-freeness principle as much as possible.

Let's consider some possible allocations:

1. **Allocate items by maximizing individual satisfaction:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 the highest at 52.
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest at 60.

2. **Remaining item allocation:**
   - After giving Item 0 to Agent 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1, we have Item 1 left.
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 6, while Agent 1 values it at 17.

Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 to maximize their satisfaction and minimize envy.

Therefore, the allocation will be:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their highest preferences available and attempts to maintain envy-freeness.

The allocations in the required json format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
