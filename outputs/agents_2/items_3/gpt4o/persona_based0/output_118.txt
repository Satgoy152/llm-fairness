Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0  1   2
0  25  5  10
1  26  2  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0:
- Item 0: 25
- Item 1: 5
- Item 2: 10

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 26
- Item 1: 2
- Item 2: 31
```

**Step 1: Determine each agent's highest valued item:**

Agent 0 values Item 0 the most (25).
Agent 1 values Item 2 the most (31).

**Step 2: Allocate each agent their highest valued item:**

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

**Step 3: Allocate the remaining item (Item 1):**

Now, we have Item 1 left to allocate. Here's how each agent values Item 1:
- Agent 0: 5
- Agent 1: 2

Since Agent 0 values Item 1 more than Agent 1, allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Item 2

**Final Allocation in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
