Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2
0  35  35  23
1  12  32  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocation given to the other agent. 

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 35, Item 1 = 35, Item 2 = 23
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 12, Item 1 = 32, Item 2 = 38

We want to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their satisfaction while considering fairness. One approach is to allocate items such that each agent receives a bundle they value highly, potentially minimizing envy. Here’s a possible allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0:**  
   - Value for Agent 0 = 35
   - Value for Agent 1 = 12

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:**  
   - Value for Agent 0 = 35
   - Value for Agent 1 = 32

3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:**  
   - Value for Agent 0 = 23
   - Value for Agent 1 = 38

This allocation results in the following total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation = 35 (Item 0) + 35 (Item 1) = 70
- Agent 1's total valuation = 38 (Item 2)

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives two items (Item 0 and Item 1) because these items have the highest combined value for them, while Agent 1 receives Item 2, which is the most valuable single item according to their valuation. 

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
