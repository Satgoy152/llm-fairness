Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2
0  80  77  56
1  19  19  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can utilize the concept of maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation more than their own. 

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 80
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 56
  
- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 19
  - Item 2: 64

A straightforward approach to achieve fairness is to allocate items such that each agent receives the items they value most, while also ensuring that the total number of items allocated is three.

Let's analyze:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for Item 0 (80), followed by Item 1 (77), and then Item 2 (56).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for Item 2 (64), followed by Items 0 and 1 equally (19 each).

Considering these valuations, we can allocate the items as follows to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to the other, and no agent envies what the other has more than what they have:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it the most and it provides the highest valuation.
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their second-highest valuation, and Agent 1 values both Items 0 and 1 equally, so Agent 0's higher valuation is prioritized.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it the most at 64.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value most, minimizing potential envy.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
