Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2
0  64   7  71
1  46  53  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. In this particular setup, we have two agents and three items. We need to look at the valuations given by each agent to determine a fair allocation.

The valuation table is as follows:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 64     | 7      | 71     |
| 1     | 46     | 53     | 14     |

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 at 64, item 1 at 7, and item 2 at 71.
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 46, item 1 at 53, and item 2 at 14.

Given these valuations, one plausible fair allocation is:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it significantly higher than Agent 1 (64 vs. 46).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it significantly higher than Agent 0 (53 vs. 7).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it significantly higher than Agent 1 (71 vs. 14).

This allocation gives each agent one item valued more highly by them than the other agent. Now, let's express this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
