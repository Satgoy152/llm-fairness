Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2
0  79  83   3
1  60  66  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly and ensure envy-freeness, we must consider the valuations of the agents and try to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring no agent feels envious of the other's allocation. Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 79
- Item 1: 83
- Item 2: 3

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 60
- Item 1: 66
- Item 2: 48

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share given their valuations. One approach to achieve this is to give each agent the item they value most, provided no conflicts arise. If conflicts do arise, we may need to evaluate based on total valuation or other fairness criteria.

Steps for allocation:
1. Consider the highest valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 the most (83).
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 (66) the most after their first choice, but the second-highest valued item is Item 2 (48).

2. Allocate Items:
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 as it is their highest valued item.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 as it is their second-highest valued item, and the highest available after Agent 0 takes Item 1.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.

By following these steps, we ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their valuation and minimizes envy.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
