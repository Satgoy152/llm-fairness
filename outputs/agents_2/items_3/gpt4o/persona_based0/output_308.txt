Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2
0  89   2  76
1  33  25  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We can try to find an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 2
  - Item 2: 76

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 25
  - Item 2: 33

A potential approach is to give each agent the item they value the most, provided it doesn't create envy. Let's explore this:

1. Agent 0 values Item 0 the highest (89), while Agent 1 values it at 33.
2. Agent 1 values Item 1 at 25, which Agent 0 values at 2.
3. Both agents value Item 2 equally (Agent 0: 76, Agent 1: 33).

Based on the above analysis, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it significantly more than Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, and it minimizes the potential for envy, given the constraints.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
