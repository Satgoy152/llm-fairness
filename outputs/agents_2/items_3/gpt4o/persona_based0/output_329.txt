Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2
0  95  60  42
1   3  58   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. Our goal is to achieve a fair distribution where each agent receives items that maximize their respective utilities while ensuring that no envy arises.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [95, 60, 42]
- Agent 1's valuations: [3, 58, 0]

To ensure that the allocation is envy-free (as much as possible, given integer item allocations), we should aim to maximize the total utility for each agent, while also considering the possible envy. 

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 95, while Agent 1 values it at 3. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for this item.

2. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 60, and Agent 1 values it at 58. Although Agent 0 has a slightly higher valuation, giving this to Agent 1 helps balance the overall distribution of value.

3. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 42, and Agent 1 values it at 0. Therefore, it makes sense to allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation provides each agent with a collection of items that maximizes their respective utility given the constraints of integer allocations and attempts to minimize envy.

Therefore, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
