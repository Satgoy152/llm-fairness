Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2
0  99  10  91
1  67  15  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness implies that each agent feels they received at least as much value as the other agent given their valuations.

Let's evaluate each agent's total valuation for all items:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 10
  - Item 2: 91
  - Total valuation: 99 + 10 + 91 = 200

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 67
  - Item 1: 15
  - Item 2: 17
  - Total valuation: 67 + 15 + 17 = 99

Given the significant difference in total valuations, Agent 0 values the items more highly. However, the goal is to allocate items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible according to their valuations.

### Possible Allocation Strategy:

1. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item the highest at 99, and it's the most valuable single item for both agents.

2. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1**: Although low in value, it is the highest-valued item for Agent 1 compared to item 2.

3. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: This item is relatively highly valued by Agent 0 at 91, compared to Agent 1's valuation of 17.

This allocation aims to minimize envy because:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, which are the highest valued items for them.
- Agent 1 receives item 1, the highest valued item available after item 0 is taken by Agent 0, and is left with no higher value options.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
