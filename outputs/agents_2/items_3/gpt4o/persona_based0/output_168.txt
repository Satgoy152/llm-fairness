Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2
0  79  24  90
1  18  35  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we need to allocate the items in such a way that neither agent prefers the other agent's allocation to their own. We approach this by maximizing each agent's total valuation given their preferences. 

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 79
  - Item 1 at 24
  - Item 2 at 90

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 18
  - Item 1 at 35
  - Item 2 at 99

We will consider all possible allocations of the items and select the one that maximizes perceived fairness for both agents. 

Let's analyze the possible allocations:

1. **Allocation 1:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
     - Total value for Agent 0: 79 + 24 = 103
   - Agent 1: Item [2]
     - Total value for Agent 1: 99

2. **Allocation 2:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
     - Total value for Agent 0: 79 + 90 = 169
   - Agent 1: Item [1]
     - Total value for Agent 1: 35

3. **Allocation 3:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
     - Total value for Agent 0: 24 + 90 = 114
   - Agent 1: Item [0]
     - Total value for Agent 1: 18

For an envy-free allocation, we want each agent to be satisfied with their allocation such that they do not envy the other's allocation. Allocation 1 seems optimal because:

- Agent 0 receives two items with a total valuation of 103.
- Agent 1 receives one item with a total valuation of 99.

This allocation results in Agent 0 having a slightly higher total valuation, but Agent 1 receives the item they value the most, thereby minimizing envy.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
