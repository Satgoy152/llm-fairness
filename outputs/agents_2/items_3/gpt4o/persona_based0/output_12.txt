Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2
0  11  47  70
1  63  44  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can consider the valuations provided by the two agents.

The table of valuations is as follows:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 11     | 47     | 70     |
| 1     | 63     | 44     | 93     |

One common approach to achieve envy-freeness in a simple setting like this is to maximize the total satisfaction of each agent by considering their highest valued items. Let's follow these steps:

1. **Agent 0's highest priority item**: Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (70).
2. **Agent 1's highest priority item**: Agent 1 values Item 2 the most (93).

Since both agents value Item 2 the most, we look at their second and third highest priorities:

- Agent 0's second and third highest valued items are Item 1 (47) and Item 0 (11).
- Agent 1's second and third highest valued items are Item 0 (63) and Item 1 (44).

Let's attempt to achieve an envy-free allocation by considering each agent's preferences:

- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: Since Agent 1 values Item 2 the most, this allocation would give them the highest satisfaction and make them less envious.
- **Allocate Items 0 and 1 to Agent 0**: This allocation gives Agent 0 their second and third priority items, which maximizes their satisfaction given that they cannot have Item 2.

This allocation results in the following distribution:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0 and Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2.

This allocation satisfies the conditions that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
