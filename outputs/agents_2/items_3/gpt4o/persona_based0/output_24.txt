Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2
0  87  59  48
1  19  13  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [19 13 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. 

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 87, Item 1 = 59, Item 2 = 48
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 19, Item 1 = 13, Item 2 = 81

One approach could be to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 because it has the highest value for them.
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 because it has the highest value for them.
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.

This allocation results in the following:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1, with a total value of 87 + 59 = 146.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2, with a total value of 81.

This allocation ensures that each agent maximizes their own satisfaction given the constraints and their valuations, and it appears to be envy-free since each agent receives the item(s) they value the most. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
