Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2
0  10  59  48
1  97  82  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should not feel that another agent's allocation is better than their own based on their valuations. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: Item 0 = 10, Item 1 = 59, Item 2 = 48
- Agent 1's valuations: Item 0 = 97, Item 1 = 82, Item 2 = 92

The goal is to allocate all three items such that each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is perceived as fair by both agents based on their subjective valuations.

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Most valued: Item 1 (59), then Item 2 (48), then Item 0 (10)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Most valued: Item 0 (97), then Item 2 (92), then Item 1 (82)

To ensure envy-freeness, we can try to allocate items so that each agent receives their most preferred item that is not highly valued by the other agent. However, due to the limited number of items, we may need to compromise.

**Proposed Allocation:**

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1:** 
   - This is Agent 1's highest valued item. 

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:** 
   - This is Agent 0's highest valued item.

3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:** 
   - This provides Agent 1 with their second-highest valued item, and Agent 0 has already received their highest valued item.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, attempting to minimize envy:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1 (value 59).
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2 (values 97 and 92).

In JSON format, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
