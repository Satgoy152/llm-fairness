Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2
0  64  76  71
1  60  71   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for each item. The goal is to distribute the items so that no agent envies the other's allocation based on their valuations.

The valuations are:
- Agent 0: Item 0 (64), Item 1 (76), Item 2 (71)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (60), Item 1 (71), Item 2 (6)

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the following strategy: assign the item to the agent who values it the most, when possible, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items:
1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 values it at 60. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 values it at 71. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 values it at 6. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

Now, let's review the allocations:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives no items.

This allocation is not envy-free because Agent 1 does not receive any items. To ensure Agent 1 receives something, we can adjust the allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 receives it.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 receives it (even though Agent 0 values it more, this prevents envy by giving Agent 1 at least one item).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 receives it.

This results in an allocation that still respects the valuations to a reasonable degree and ensures each agent gets at least one item.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
