Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2
0  80  49  91
1  92  54  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a manner that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should feel that they have received items that are at least as valuable to them as the items received by the other agent.

Here are the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 80, Item 1 at 49, Item 2 at 91.
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 92, Item 1 at 54, Item 2 at 79.

Let's evaluate the total valuations for each possible allocation and choose the one that minimizes envy. One good strategy is to assign items to the agent who values them more if there are no conflicts, or balance the allocation when values are close.

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (92 vs. 80).
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (54 vs. 49).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (91 vs. 79).

A possible allocation that respects these preferences could be:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

Checking the total value for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2, total value = 49 + 91 = 140.
- Agent 1 receives item 0, total value = 92.

This allocation minimizes envy by maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
