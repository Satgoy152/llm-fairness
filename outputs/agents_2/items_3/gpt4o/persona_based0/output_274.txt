Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2
0  78  11  97
1  40  71  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they receive a fair share of the items based on their valuations. The goal is to minimize envy, which occurs when one agent values another's allocation more than their own.

First, let's consider the valuations table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 78     | 11     | 97     |
| 1     | 40     | 71     | 34     |

Let's compute the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 total value: 78 + 11 + 97 = 186
- Agent 1 total value: 40 + 71 + 34 = 145

Given these valuations, we want to allocate items to minimize envy. 

1. **Allocate Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 97, while Agent 1 values it at 34.
   - It should go to Agent 0 because they value it significantly more.

2. **Allocate Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 11, while Agent 1 values it at 71.
   - It should go to Agent 1 because they have a much higher valuation for this item.

3. **Allocate Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 78, while Agent 1 values it at 40.
   - It should go to Agent 0 because they place a higher value on it.

With this allocation, each agent receives two items, and they have been allocated based on maximizing each agent's value from the items they receive.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, while Agent 1 receives item 1. This allocation aims to minimize envy by giving each agent the items they value most.
