Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2
0  82  59   9
1  80  43  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim for an envy-free or as close-to-envy-free distribution as possible. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they received an appropriate share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:
- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 82, Item 1 = 59, Item 2 = 9
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 80, Item 1 = 43, Item 2 = 55

A reasonable approach is to allocate the items so that the sum of valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible, reducing potential envy.

Let's consider the possible allocations:

1. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0**: This item is highly valued by both agents, but slightly more by Agent 0 (82 vs. 80).
2. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item significantly higher than Agent 0 (55 vs. 9).
3. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0**: This item has a higher value for Agent 0 (59 vs. 43).

This allocation results in the following total valuations:
- Agent 0: 82 (Item 0) + 59 (Item 1) = 141
- Agent 1: 55 (Item 2)

Though Agent 0 has a higher total valuation, this allocation minimizes Agent 1's potential envy because they receive the item they value most (Item 2), and the disparity is due to the high value both agents place on Item 0.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
