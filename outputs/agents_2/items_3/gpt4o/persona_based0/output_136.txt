Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2
0  79  35  27
1  76  28  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 27

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 76
  - Item 1: 28
  - Item 2: 51

A fair division should consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction while minimizing envy. We can try different allocations and evaluate them based on the total valuation each agent receives.

### Possible Allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 79
   - Agent 1 values it at 76

2. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 27
   - Agent 1 values it at 51

3. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 35
   - Agent 1 values it at 28

**Agent Valuation Totals:**
- Agent 0: 79 (Item 0) + 35 (Item 1) = 114
- Agent 1: 51 (Item 2)

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 114 and Agent 1 a total valuation of 51. While not perfectly envy-free since Agent 1 has a lower total valuation, this allocation tries to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their highest preferences while still adhering to the integer item allocation constraint.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item. Despite the inherent difficulty in achieving perfect envy-freeness with only three items and two agents, this distribution is a reasonable approach given the constraints.
