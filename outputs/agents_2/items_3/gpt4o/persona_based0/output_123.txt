Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2
0  60   1  40
1  53  56  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to find an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness suggests that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what any other agent receives.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 60, Item 1 = 1, Item 2 = 40.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 53, Item 1 = 56, Item 2 = 71.

One approach to achieve an allocation is to maximize the total utility while trying to minimize envy. We can use the following steps:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it most, if possible.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 60, and Agent 1 values it at 53. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 1, and Agent 1 values it at 56. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 40, and Agent 1 values it at 71. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
