Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2
0  17  50  18
1  71  12  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations to make sure no agent envies another's allocation. Here are the steps and the reasoning behind the allocation:

1. **Understanding Valuations**:
   - Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 17, Item 1 at 50, Item 2 at 18.
   - Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 71, Item 1 at 12, Item 2 at 98.

2. **Identify Preferences**:
   - Agent 0's highest valued item is Item 1.
   - Agent 1's highest valued item is Item 2.

3. **Allocating Based on Preferences**:
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 since it is their highest valued item.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 since it is their highest valued item.

4. **Remaining Items Allocation**:
   - The only item left is Item 0. Agent 1 values Item 0 significantly higher (71) compared to Agent 0 (17).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 to maximize their satisfaction and maintain envy-freeness.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This distribution ensures that Agent 0 receives their most valued item (Item 1), and Agent 1 receives the remaining items with the highest total value according to their valuation.
