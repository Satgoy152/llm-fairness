Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2
0  99  93  66
1  34  74  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items and aim for an envy-free allocation if possible. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle, based on their own valuations.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 93
  - Item 2: 66

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 23

To achieve a fair allocation, we first consider the highest valuation each agent assigns to an item:

- Agent 0 values Item 0 the highest at 99.
- Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest at 74.

Given these preferences, a natural allocation would be:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item, Item 2, in such a way that the allocation remains as fair as possible:

- Agent 0 values Item 2 at 66.
- Agent 1 values Item 2 at 23.

Since Agent 0 values Item 2 significantly higher than Agent 1, assigning Item 2 to Agent 0 will minimize potential envy.

Thus, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 1: Item 1

This allocation is envy-free because:

- Agent 0 has a total value of 165 (99 + 66) from Items 0 and 2, which is greater than the value of Item 1 (93) that Agent 0 does not receive.
- Agent 1 receives Item 1 with a value of 74, which is higher than the value of Items 0 and 2 combined (57) that Agent 1 does not receive.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
