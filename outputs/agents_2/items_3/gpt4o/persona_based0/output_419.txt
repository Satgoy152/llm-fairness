Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2
0  92  58   1
1  86  72  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 72 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll consider the valuations provided and aim for an envy-free allocation, if possible. 

The table of valuations is as follows:

```
Agent 0: [92, 58, 1]
Agent 1: [86, 72, 60]
```

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(92 + 58 + 1 = 151\)
- Agent 1: \(86 + 72 + 60 = 218\)

To find an envy-free allocation, we want each agent to believe they have received at least as much value as the other agent, given the allocations.

Let's consider potential allocations:

1. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 and items 1 and 2 to Agent 1:**  
   - Agent 0's total value: 92
   - Agent 1's total value: 72 + 60 = 132

   In this allocation, Agent 0 receives item 0, which they value at 92. Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2, which they value at 72 and 60, respectively. This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle that maximizes their perception of fairness based on their own valuations.

   Agent 0 values their allocation at 92, while if they had Agent 1's allocation, they would value it at \(58 + 1 = 59\). So, Agent 0 is not envious. 

   Agent 1 values their allocation at 132, while if they had Agent 0's allocation, they would value it at 86. So, Agent 1 is not envious either.

This allocation is envy-free as each agent prefers their allocation to the other's based on their own valuations.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
