Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2
0  18  76  99
1  76  89  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will consider the concept of envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. We will evaluate the total value each agent assigns to different possible allocations and strive to achieve the most balanced distribution.

The valuations given are as follows:

- Agent 0:
  - Value for item 0: 18
  - Value for item 1: 76
  - Value for item 2: 99
  
- Agent 1:
  - Value for item 0: 76
  - Value for item 1: 89
  - Value for item 2: 77

To achieve an envy-free allocation, let's evaluate the total values for each possible allocation:

1. **Assignment 1:**
   - Agent 0 gets items [0, 2]
   - Agent 1 gets item [1]

   Total value for Agent 0 = 18 (item 0) + 99 (item 2) = 117  
   Total value for Agent 1 = 89 (item 1) = 89

2. **Assignment 2:**
   - Agent 0 gets items [1, 2]
   - Agent 1 gets item [0]

   Total value for Agent 0 = 76 (item 1) + 99 (item 2) = 175  
   Total value for Agent 1 = 76 (item 0) = 76

3. **Assignment 3:**
   - Agent 0 gets items [0]
   - Agent 1 gets items [1, 2]

   Total value for Agent 0 = 18 (item 0) = 18  
   Total value for Agent 1 = 89 (item 1) + 77 (item 2) = 166

Among these allocations, we seek the one that minimizes envy. In this case, Assignment 1 seems to provide a reasonable balance given the agents' valuations, as it leaves Agent 0 considerably more satisfied than Agent 1, but the disparity between their respective total values is not as extreme as in Assignment 2.

Thus, the allocations that seem fair are:

Agent 0: [0, 2]  
Agent 1: [1]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
