Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2
0  85  73  22
1  48  62  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each allocation is envy-free to the extent possible, given that each agent must receive an integer number of items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 85
  - Item 1 at 73
  - Item 2 at 22

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 48
  - Item 1 at 62
  - Item 2 at 57

A fair and envy-free allocation would attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it more (85 vs. 48). Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 at 62. Agent 0 technically values it more, but if we give both Items 0 and 1 to Agent 0, Agent 1 might be envious since Agent 1 values Item 2 (57) relatively high as well.
   - To balance and reduce potential envy, assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - The remaining item is Item 2. Agent 1 values it higher (57 vs. 22), so assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0.
- Agent 1 gets Items 1 and 2.

This allocation attempts to be fair by giving each agent an item they value relatively highly and equitably distributing total valuation. 

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
