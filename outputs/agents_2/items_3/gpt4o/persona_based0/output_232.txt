Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2
0  21  58  68
1  11  81   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Given that we have 2 agents and 3 items, each agent should receive an integer number of items, and the total allocation must include all 3 items. 

The valuation matrix is as follows:

- Agent 0 values items as: [21, 58, 68]
- Agent 1 values items as: [11, 81, 6]

A good approach to achieve a fair allocation is to assign items such that each agent gets the maximum possible value while ensuring envy-freeness. One possible allocation that achieves this is:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, since they value it at 81, which is their highest valuation and also greater than Agent 0's valuation for the same item.
2. Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 0. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 68 and item 0 at 21, which are both greater than Agent 1's valuations for those items.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of 21 + 68 = 89.
- Agent 1: Item 1, with a total valuation of 81.

Under this allocation, neither agent is envious of the other, as each agent receives their most valuable items given the constraint.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
