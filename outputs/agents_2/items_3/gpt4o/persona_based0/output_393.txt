Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2
0  59  69  56
1  28  23   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items while considering envy-freeness, we analyze the agents' valuations for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation, meaning each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

Given the valuation table:

```
Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2
-----------|----|----|----
0          | 59 | 69 | 56
1          | 28 | 23 | 7
```

We need to allocate the 3 items (0, 1, 2) to 2 agents (0, 1).

**Step-by-step Analysis:**

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 59
   - Item 1: 69
   - Item 2: 56

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 28
   - Item 1: 23
   - Item 2: 7

**Allocation Strategy:**

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should aim to assign the items in a way that maximizes each agent's perceived value of their allocation compared to the potential value they could achieve by trading allocations with the other agent.

- Agent 0 values items 0, 1, and 2 significantly higher than Agent 1 does. Therefore, it makes sense to allocate items to maximize Agent 0's value.
  
- Agent 1 has significantly lower valuations for all items compared to Agent 0, so we aim to give Agent 1 a combination that provides a reasonable total value without causing envy.

**Proposed Allocation:**

1. **Allocate Items:**
   - Give Agent 0 item 1, which they value the highest (69).
   - Give Agent 1 items 0 and 2, which collectively provide them with the highest possible value (28 + 7 = 35).

This allocation ensures that:
- Agent 0 gets the item they value the most.
- Agent 1 gets two items that maximize their total valuation, given Agent 0's high valuations.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
