Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2
0  88  46  54
1  51  53  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. However, given the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items, this might not always achieve envy-freeness perfectly. The goal is to allocate the items so that the perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible, given these constraints.

Let's evaluate the preferences of each agent based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 88
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 54

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 1: 53
  - Item 2: 58

To strive for a fair allocation, we should consider giving each agent the items that provide them the highest value, while also ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly three.

Let's assign the items as follows:
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as it is the most valuable item for Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as it is more valuable to Agent 1 than to Agent 0, and assigning Item 2 to Agent 1 would leave Agent 0 with a significantly lower total value.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as it provides Agent 1 the highest remaining value.

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2

The allocation decision is based on maximizing the total perceived value for each agent while adhering to the constraint of allocating all items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 3 items are distributed among the agents while attempting to balance their perceived values.
