Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2
0  79  46  89
1  62  28  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[79 46 89]
 [62 28 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of both agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 0 - 79, Item 1 - 46, Item 2 - 89
- Agent 1: Item 0 - 62, Item 1 - 28, Item 2 - 30

We will consider the total valuation each agent has for the items and attempt to allocate items to maximize the sum of the valuations for each agent.

### Possible Allocation Strategies:

1. **Maximizing Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items as: 0 (79), 1 (46), and 2 (89).
   - Agent 1 values items as: 0 (62), 1 (28), and 2 (30).

2. **Allocation Based on Highest Value:**
   - Agent 0 should get item 2, as it has the highest value (89) for them.
   - Agent 1 should get item 0, as it has the highest value (62) for them.
   - Item 1 remains, and since its value is relatively low for both agents, we look at the next best allocation.

3. **Checking Remaining Items and Values:**
   - After the initial allocation:
     - Agent 0 has item 2.
     - Agent 1 has item 0.
   - Item 1 is left. Considering the remaining allocations:
     - Agent 0 values item 1 at 46.
     - Agent 1 values item 1 at 28.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 as it maximizes their total valuation.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.

This allocation ensures all three items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items. It also maximizes the total valuation for each agent under these constraints.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0]
}
```
