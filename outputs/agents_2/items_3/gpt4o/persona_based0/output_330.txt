Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2
0  76   7  80
1  94  25   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [94 25  0]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that is envy-free and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations provided for each item by the agents. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the other agent's allocation.

Based on the given table of valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 76     | 7      | 80     |
| 1     | 94     | 25     | 0      |

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0 and 2. Allocating item 2 to agent 0 gives them a high value of 80. 

2. **Agent 1**: Item 0 is valued the highest by agent 1. Allocating item 0 to agent 1 gives them a high value of 94.

3. **Remaining Item (Item 1)**: This item has a higher relative value to agent 1 than agent 0. Allocating item 1 to agent 1 maximizes their total value.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives item 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive an integer number of items and the total distribution is exactly the 3 items available. Additionally, each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value the other agent's allocation, maintaining an envy-free distribution.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
