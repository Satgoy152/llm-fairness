Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2
0  66  90  75
1  96  69  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation where each agent feels as satisfied as possible given their preferences. A common approach is to attempt to minimize envy, ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of items they value at least as much as any other agent's bundle.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 66, Item 1 at 90, Item 2 at 75.
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 96, Item 1 at 69, Item 2 at 10.

Let's analyze the best allocation by considering the total valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Total value of all items: 66 + 90 + 75 = 231

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Total value of all items: 96 + 69 + 10 = 175

To minimize envy, we want to allocate items such that the perceived value of each agent's allocation is maximized according to their own valuations.

One potential fair allocation is:

- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Items 0 and 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1, valued at 90.
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 and 2, valued at 96 + 10 = 106.

This allocation is envy-free because:

- Agent 0 values their allocation (90) more than Agent 1's allocation (66 + 75 = 141).
- Agent 1 values their allocation (106) more than Agent 0â€™s allocation (69).

Therefore, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
