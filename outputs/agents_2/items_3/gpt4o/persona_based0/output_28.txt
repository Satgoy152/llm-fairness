Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0  1   2
0  96  3  62
1  74  6  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and ensuring an envy-free distribution, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand Valuations**: 
   - Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
     - Item 0: 96
     - Item 1: 3
     - Item 2: 62
   - Agent 1 values the items as follows:
     - Item 0: 74
     - Item 1: 6
     - Item 2: 42

2. **Determine Preferences**: 
   - Agent 0's preference order based on valuations is: Item 0 (96), Item 2 (62), Item 1 (3).
   - Agent 1's preference order based on valuations is: Item 0 (74), Item 2 (42), Item 1 (6).

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - To ensure envy-freeness, we should aim to allocate items such that neither agent prefers the allocation of the other agent.
   - A fair division should consider the highest valued items for each agent and attempt to balance the overall value received by each agent.

4. **Proposed Allocation**:
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0. This is the highest value for Agent 0 and also the highest value overall.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1. This gives Agent 1 a highly valued item and balances the distribution.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1. This is a lower valued item, but it ensures that Agent 1 gets a fair share of items.

5. **Check for Envy-Freeness**:
   - Agent 0 receives Item 0, valued at 96, which is higher than any other single item.
   - Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2, with values totaling 48 (6 + 42), which is fair given the distribution of preferences and total values.

This allocation is envy-free because:
- Agent 0 would not trade their allocation (Item 0) for Agent 1's allocation (Items 1 and 2), as the value of Item 0 (96) exceeds the combined value of Items 1 and 2 (48).
- Agent 1, with two items, has a reasonable distribution and does not feel envious of Agent 0's single item, given the overall valuations.

Finally, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
