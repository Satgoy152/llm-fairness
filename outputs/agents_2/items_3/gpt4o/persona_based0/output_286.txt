Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2
0  10   6  25
1  69  13  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that they do not envy the other agent's allocation. In this context, envy-freeness means that each agent should value their allocated items at least as much as they value the other agent's allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 10, Item 1 = 6, Item 2 = 25.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 69, Item 1 = 13, Item 2 = 54.

One possible fair allocation can be:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 6 (Item 1) + 25 (Item 2) = 31.
- Agent 1's total valuation: 69 (Item 0) = 69.

Agent 0 does not envy Agent 1 because Agent 0 values their own allocation (31) more than Agent 1's allocation (10 for Item 0). Agent 1 does not envy Agent 0 because Agent 1 values their own allocation (69 for Item 0) more than Agent 0's allocation (67 = 54 for Item 2 + 13 for Item 1).

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
