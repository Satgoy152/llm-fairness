Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2
0  49  90  37
1  38  90  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for envy-freeness, where each agent prefers their own allocation over the others'. We can start by summing the total value each agent assigns to all items and examining the possibilities:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 49
- Item 1: 90
- Item 2: 37
- Total: 176

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 38
- Item 1: 90
- Item 2: 89
- Total: 217

We want to allocate the items such that each agent maximizes their valuation of their own set of items, while minimizing envy.

Possible allocations include:
1. Assigning the highest-valued item for each agent.
2. Balancing the total value of items for each agent.

Let's consider allocating items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 and item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.

With this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items valued at 49 (item 0) + 37 (item 2) = 86.
- Agent 1 receives item 1 valued at 90.

This allocation gives a near balance and minimizes potential envy, as Agent 1 gets the item they value highest, and Agent 0 gets two items that together have a significant combined value.

The final allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
