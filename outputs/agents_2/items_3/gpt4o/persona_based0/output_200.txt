Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2
0  91  27   6
1  13  64  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 91
  - Item 1 at 27
  - Item 2 at 6

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 13
  - Item 1 at 64
  - Item 2 at 85

To ensure envy-freeness, we want to allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their total valuation while minimizing envy. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item the highest (91), and giving it to them makes sense as it is the most valuable item for them.

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item at 64, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 27.

3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item at 85, which is significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation of 6.

This allocation ensures that Agent 1 gets the higher total value they can obtain (64 + 85 = 149) compared to Agent 0 (91). Also, Agent 0 cannot envy Agent 1 because they have received their highest valued item (91), and Agent 1 cannot envy Agent 0 as their total valuation is higher.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
