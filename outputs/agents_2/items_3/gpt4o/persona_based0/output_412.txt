Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2
0  47  48   2
1  28  38  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent receives items such that no agent prefers the other's allocation given their respective valuations.

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 47
  - Item 1: 48
  - Item 2: 2

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 28
  - Item 1: 38
  - Item 2: 50

### Total Valuations for Each Item:
- **Item 0:** 47 (Agent 0) + 28 (Agent 1) = 75
- **Item 1:** 48 (Agent 0) + 38 (Agent 1) = 86
- **Item 2:** 2 (Agent 0) + 50 (Agent 1) = 52

### Strategy for Fair Allocation:
1. **Agent 0** values Item 1 the highest and Item 0 the next highest.
2. **Agent 1** values Item 2 the highest and Item 1 the next highest.

To reduce envy:
- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: This maximizes Agent 0's valuation since it's their highest valued item.
- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: This maximizes Agent 1's valuation since it's their highest valued item.
- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: This ensures that Agent 0 has a fair allocation since they value Item 0 highly and it balances their total valuation in comparison to Agent 1.

### Resulting Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets Item 2.

This allocation should be envy-free because each agent receives their most preferred available items given the constraints, and no agent can obtain a higher valuation from the items allocated to the other.

### Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
