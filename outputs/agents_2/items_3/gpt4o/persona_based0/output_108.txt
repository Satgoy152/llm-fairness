Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2
0  36  93  56
1  97  50  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximization of total valuation under the constraint of envy-freeness. This means that we try to allocate the items in such a way that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 36, Item 1 = 93, Item 2 = 56.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 97, Item 1 = 50, Item 2 = 57.

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we will try to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair portion of the total value.

We will consider different allocations to find one that minimizes envy:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 and Items 0 and 2 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0 receives Item 1 (value = 93).
   - Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2 (value = 97 + 57 = 154).

2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 and Items 1 and 2 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0 receives Item 0 (value = 36).
   - Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2 (value = 50 + 57 = 107).

3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 and Items 0 and 1 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0 receives Item 2 (value = 56).
   - Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1 (value = 97 + 50 = 147).

By examining these allocations, Allocation 1 seems to provide a reasonable balance, as Agent 0 receives the most valued item for them, and Agent 1 receives two items, maximizing their total value from the remaining items.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
