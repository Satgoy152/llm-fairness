Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2
0  50  33  23
1  75  68  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure a reasonable distribution of value. Let's examine the total valuations each agent has for all items:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 50
- Item 1: 33
- Item 2: 23  
Total = 50 + 33 + 23 = 106

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 75
- Item 1: 68
- Item 2: 37  
Total = 75 + 68 + 37 = 180

To minimize envy and ensure fairness, we can consider maximizing the value each agent receives relative to their total valuation. Here's a reasonable allocation:

1. Give Item 0 to Agent 1. This is because Agent 1 values Item 0 significantly more than Agent 0 (75 vs. 50).
2. Give Item 1 to Agent 1. Agent 1 values this item higher (68 vs. 33).
3. Give Item 2 to Agent 0. Agent 0 values this item less than Agent 1 does, but it's the remaining item.

This distribution results in:
- Agent 0: Item 2 (Value = 23)
- Agent 1: Item 0 and Item 1 (Value = 75 + 68 = 143)

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to consider each agent's preferences to minimize potential envy.
