Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2
0  68  56  58
1  34  70  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items in a way that each agent perceives as fair based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own based on their own valuations. We have two agents and three items to allocate.

Let's look at the valuation table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 68     | 56     | 58     |
| 1     | 34     | 70     | 20     |

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (68)
   - Second highest: Item 2 (58)
   - Third highest: Item 1 (56)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences**:
   - Highest value: Item 1 (70)
   - Second highest: Item 0 (34)
   - Third highest: Item 2 (20)

### Allocation Strategy:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest (68) and Agent 1 values it less (34).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (70) and Agent 0 values it less (56).
- For Item 2:
  - Assign it to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it more (58) than Agent 1 does (20).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an allocation that they value highly, reducing the possibility of envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, while Agent 1 receives item 1. This allocation is envy-free given the provided valuations.
