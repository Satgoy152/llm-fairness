Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2
0  61  35  42
1   8  91  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 8 91 18]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents (0 and 1) such that the allocation is envy-free, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations:
  - Item 0: 61
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 42

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 8
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 18

An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by the other agent over their own.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values item 1 significantly more (91) than Agent 0 (35). Allocating item 1 to Agent 1 minimizes potential envy.

2. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (61), while Agent 1 values it at only 8. Allocating item 0 to Agent 0 ensures that Agent 0 receives a valuable item.

3. **Item 2:** With item 1 already allocated to Agent 1 and item 0 to Agent 0, item 2 can be considered for either agent. However, Agent 0 values item 2 more (42) than Agent 1 (18), so it would make sense to allocate item 2 to Agent 0 to balance the allocation.

**Final Allocations:**

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 1: Item 1

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
