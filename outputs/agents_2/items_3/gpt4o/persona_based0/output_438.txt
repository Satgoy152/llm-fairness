Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2
0  95  43  26
1  36  88  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to consider the valuations of the items by each agent and try to achieve an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation, according to their own valuations.

Let's start by evaluating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value for all items = 95 + 43 + 26 = 164
- Agent 1's total value for all items = 36 + 88 + 79 = 203

Now, let's analyze the value each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 43
  - Item 2: 26

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 88
  - Item 2: 79

To achieve a fair allocation, we need to ensure that each agent gets a bundle of items such that they feel their allocation is fair compared to what the other agent receives. One approach is to maximize the minimum satisfaction across agents, often referred to as the "maximin" approach.

Let's consider potential allocations:

1. Agent 0 receives item 0 and Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 0's total value: 95
   - Agent 1's total value: 88 + 79 = 167

2. Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2, and Agent 1 receives item 0.
   - Agent 0's total value: 43 + 26 = 69
   - Agent 1's total value: 36

The first allocation results in a higher satisfaction for both agents if we maximize agent 0's allocation based on their highest valued item. The second allocation provides a lower total value for both agents compared to the first allocation.

Therefore, the optimal fair allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
