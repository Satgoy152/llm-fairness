Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2
0  78  18  76
1  75  87   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations from each agent's perspective. Our goal is to assign items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations for items:
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 76

- Agent 1's valuations for items:
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 87
  - Item 2: 4

We need to allocate all three items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share. Let's analyze possible allocations:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item highly (87), whereas Agent 0 values it at 18. Thus, assigning Item 1 to Agent 1 would maximize satisfaction for Agent 1.
  
2. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item at 76, significantly higher than Agent 1 who values it at 4. Therefore, assigning Item 2 to Agent 0 would maximize satisfaction for Agent 0.

3. **Item 0**: Both agents value this item highly (Agent 0 values it at 78, and Agent 1 values it at 75). However, since Agent 1 has already obtained Item 1, which they value the highest, we can assign Item 0 to Agent 0 to maintain fairness.

Given this analysis, the allocations can be made as follows:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while maintaining envy-freeness.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
