Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2
0  63  67  86
1  97  32   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to achieve envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation, based on their valuations.

Let's first examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 63
  - Item 1: 67
  - Item 2: 86

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 1: 32
  - Item 2: 0

A reasonable approach to achieve a fair allocation is to assign items based on the highest valuation by each agent for items that are not already allocated, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is precisely 3.

Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most (86), while Agent 1 values it at 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values it the most (97), while Agent 0 values it at 63.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 1**:
   - Item 1 is the remaining item. Agent 0 values it at 67, while Agent 1 values it at 32.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Thus, the final allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0]
}
```
