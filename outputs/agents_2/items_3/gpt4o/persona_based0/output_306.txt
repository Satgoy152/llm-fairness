Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2
0  56  42  59
1   8  65  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to minimize envy, ensuring that each agent prefers their allocation over the other's. This may not always be possible to achieve perfectly, but we can strive for an allocation that approaches this goal.

Letâ€™s break down the valuations and consider possible allocations:

Valuations:
- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 56
  - Item 1: 42
  - Item 2: 59

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 8
  - Item 1: 65
  - Item 2: 43

We will consider allocations that give each agent at least one item and attempt to balance their perceived value.

### Possible Allocation:
1. **Give Agent 0 Item 0 (value 56) and Item 2 (value 59)**.
2. **Give Agent 1 Item 1 (value 65)**.

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 perceives a total value of 56 + 59 = 115.
- Agent 1 perceives a total value of 65.

Now, let's check for envy:
- Agent 0 has items 0 and 2 with a total perceived value of 115.
- Agent 1 has item 1 with a perceived value of 65.

Both agents prefer their own allocations to the other's, as Agent 0's perceived value of their allocation is higher than the value they would perceive from Agent 1's item, and Agent 1's perceived value is the highest possible for them.

### Allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
