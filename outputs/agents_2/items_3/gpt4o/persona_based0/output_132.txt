Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2
0  91  24  72
1  62  45  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair according to their valuations. The goal is to minimize envy and, ideally, achieve an envy-free allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 91
  - Item 1: 24
  - Item 2: 72

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 62
  - Item 1: 45
  - Item 2: 42

We can examine potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0 gets items that maximize their total value while minimizing potential envy from Agent 1.**

   - If Agent 0 takes item 0 and item 2, their total valuation is 91 + 72 = 163.
   - If Agent 1 takes item 1, their total valuation is 45.

   This allocation results in Agent 0 receiving items with a total valuation of 163, and Agent 1 with 45.

2. **Check for envy:**

   - Agent 0 sees their allocation as 163 versus Agent 1’s 45, so no envy.
   - Agent 1 sees their allocation as 45 versus Agent 0’s 163, which can lead to envy.

3. **Alternative allocation to test for less envy:**

   - Agent 0 takes item 0, their most valued item.
   - Agent 1 takes items 1 and 2.

   - Agent 0's total valuation: 91
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 45 + 42 = 87

   In this allocation:
   - Agent 0’s value is 91, Agent 1’s value is 87.
   - The envy is minimized as both agents receive close to equal valuations.

Final allocation with minimized envy:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
