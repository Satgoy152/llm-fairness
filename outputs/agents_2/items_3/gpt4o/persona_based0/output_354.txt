Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2
0  77   8  64
1  42  25  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. We look at the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0: 77, Item 1: 8, Item 2: 64.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0: 42, Item 1: 25, Item 2: 28.

One potential way to allocate these items is to assign them in a way that maximizes each agent's valuation while trying to ensure that no agent envies the other's allocation. 

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0: Agent 0 values it at 77, which is the highest valuation for any item by any agent.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1: Although Agent 0 values Item 1 at 8, it is not a significant valuation compared to Agent 1's valuation of 25.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1: Agent 1 has a moderate valuation of 28 for this item, which is higher than Agent 0's remaining item valuation of 64 for Item 2.

This allocation attempts to maximize the individual preferences of the agents given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
