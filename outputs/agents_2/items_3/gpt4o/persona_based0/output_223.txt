Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2
0  51  56   3
1  24  62  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should be at least as happy with their allocation as they would be with any other agent's allocation, given their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 2: 3

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 24
  - Item 1: 62
  - Item 2: 98

One simple method to achieve a fair division is to allocate items such that each agent receives the items they value the most, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's one potential allocation:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 because it's the highest valued item for Agent 0 (value of 56).
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because it's the highest valued item for Agent 1 (value of 98).
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it is the second highest valued item for Agent 0 (value of 51), and it is less valued by Agent 1 (value of 24).

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.

The allocations can be represented in the required JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and it respects their individual valuations, aiming for a fair distribution.
