Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2
0  63  39  95
1  40  79  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to minimize envy, ensuring that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 63
  - Item 1 at 39
  - Item 2 at 95

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 40
  - Item 1 at 79
  - Item 2 at 19

A simple approach to achieving envy-freeness, given that each agent must receive an integer number of items, is to allocate items such that each agent gets the items they value the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the highest at 95.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the highest at 79.

Assigning these items to the respective agents:

- Assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to agent 1.

Now, one item remains: item 0.

- For item 0:
  - Agent 0 values it at 63.
  - Agent 1 values it at 40.

Since agent 0 values item 0 higher than agent 1, it is reasonable to allocate item 0 to agent 0.

Therefore, the fair allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.

This allocation minimizes envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
