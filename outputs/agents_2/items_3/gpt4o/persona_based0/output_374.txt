Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2
0  33   8  21
1  13  78   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to make the allocation envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Here's the breakdown of the agents' valuations:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 8
  - Item 2: 21

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 13
  - Item 1: 78
  - Item 2: 8

Analyzing these valuations, we can try to maximize the total satisfaction or ensure that each agent receives items that they value relatively higher compared to the other agent.

### Allocation Proposal:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item significantly higher (78) than Agent 0 (8). Hence, it should be allocated to Agent 1.
2. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item higher (33) than Agent 1 (13). Therefore, it should be allocated to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item (21) more than Agent 1 (8). Thus, it should also be allocated to Agent 0.

Following this logic, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 2
- **Agent 1**: Item 1

These allocations maximize the individual valuations and are as close to an envy-free distribution as possible given the constraints.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
