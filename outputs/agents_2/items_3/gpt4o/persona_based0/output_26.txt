Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2
0  40  51  76
1  43  77  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent believes they have received the best possible allocation given their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 51
  - Item 2: 76

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 43
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 84

To approach a fair allocation, we can use the following strategy:

1. Assign the item with the highest absolute valuation to each agent in rotation, minimizing potential envy.
2. Check if the allocation satisfies both agents such that neither feels they would prefer the allocation of the other.

Let's analyze the possible allocations:

- Agent 0's highest valuation is for item 2 (76), and Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 2 as well (84). 
- To minimize envy, we can assign item 2 to Agent 1 as their valuation of it is higher.
- We then look at the remaining items, 0 and 1. Agent 0 values item 1 at 51, which is higher than their valuation of item 0 (40). Agent 1 also values item 1 highly (77), but since Agent 1 already has item 2, we can assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- The remaining item 0, valued at 40 by Agent 0 and 43 by Agent 1, can be assigned to Agent 0, as it balances the allocation with each agent receiving similar total valuations based on their own perspectives.

Following this strategy, we achieve the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value each agent receives based on their individual valuations, minimizing potential envy.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
