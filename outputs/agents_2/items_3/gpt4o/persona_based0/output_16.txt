Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2
0  44  75  21
1  18  55  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free division if possible. This means each agent should feel that they received a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 44
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 21

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 1: 55
  - Item 2: 20

Given these valuations, we want to allocate items so that each agent feels they have a fair share based on their own valuation.

One possible allocation is:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0. Agent 0 highly values this item (75), making it a significant part of their total perceived value.
- Assign Items 0 and 2 to Agent 1. This adds up to a total value of 38 for Agent 1, which is higher than Agent 1's value of 55 for Item 1 alone.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receiving Item 1, valued at 75.
- Agent 1 receiving Items 0 and 2, valued at 18 and 20, respectively, totaling 38.

This allocation is envy-free because:
- Agent 0 would not prefer Agent 1's allocation, as they perceive Item 1 as having more value than the sum of Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 would not prefer Agent 0's allocation, as they perceive the combined value of Items 0 and 2 (38) to be higher than the value of Item 1 alone (55).

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
