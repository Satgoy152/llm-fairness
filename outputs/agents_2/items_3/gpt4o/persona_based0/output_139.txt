Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2
0   7  31  42
1  33  95  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 95 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to make sure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as the other agent's allocation from their perspective.

### Valuations Table:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 31
  - Item 2: 42

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 95
  - Item 2: 75

### Steps to Allocate Items:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Agent**:  
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (42).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (95).

2. **Initial Allocations Based on Highest Valuation**:
   - Give item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Give item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining Items and Allocation**:
   - The remaining item is 0.
   - Compare the valuation of item 0 for both agents:
     - Agent 0: 7
     - Agent 1: 33
   - Item 0 should be given to Agent 1 because it improves their allocation significantly more.

### Resulting Allocations:
By following the steps above, we ensure that:
- Agent 0 gets item 2, which they value the most.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1, which they value more, ensuring envy-freeness from their perspective.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
