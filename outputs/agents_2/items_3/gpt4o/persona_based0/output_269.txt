Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2
0  51  77  67
1  38  98   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility or minimizing envy. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 51
- Item 1: 77
- Item 2: 67

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 38
- Item 1: 98
- Item 2: 7

We will aim to allocate the items such that each agent gets as much value as possible, and the allocation is envy-free.

### Possible Allocation Strategy:

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1:** This is the highest value item for Agent 1 (value 98).
2. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0:** This is the second highest value for Agent 0 (value 51) but considering Agent 1 has already received a high-value item, Agent 0 should get something comparable.
3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0:** This item has a high value for Agent 0 (value 67), and Agent 1 values it the least (value 7).

### Resulting Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2, with total value = 51 + 67 = 118
- Agent 1 gets item 1, with total value = 98

Agent 0 has no reason to envy Agent 1 because:
- Agent 0’s total value (118) is greater than Agent 1’s total value (98).

Agent 1 has no reason to envy Agent 0 because:
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 98, which is higher than the sum of their valuations for items 0 and 2 (38 + 7 = 45).

Therefore, the allocation is envy-free.

### JSON Format Output:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
