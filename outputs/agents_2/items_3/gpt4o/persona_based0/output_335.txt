Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2
0  43  14  64
1   6  59  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider how each agent values each item and ensure that each agent feels they have received their fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's first summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 43
  - Item 1: 14
  - Item 2: 64

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 6
  - Item 1: 59
  - Item 2: 19

A common approach to achieve envy-freeness is to maximize the minimum utility each agent receives, given their valuations.

Let's consider the possible allocations:

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0, Item 1 to Agent 1, and Item 0 to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of 43 + 64 = 107.
   - Agent 1 receives item 1, with a total valuation of 59.

2. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1, Item 1 to Agent 0, and Item 2 to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2, with a total valuation of 14 + 64 = 78.
   - Agent 1 receives item 0, with a total valuation of 6.

3. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, Item 0 to Agent 1, and Item 2 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 0 receives item 1, with a total valuation of 14.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of 6 + 19 = 25.

From these possible allocations, option 1 maximizes the minimum utility (59 for Agent 1 and 107 for Agent 0) and is also envy-free because:
- Agent 0, with items 0 and 2, has a much higher valuation than if they had Agent 1's item.
- Agent 1, with item 1, values it higher than any single item Agent 0 has.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
