Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2
0  19  64  57
1  46  51  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 = 19, Item 1 = 64, Item 2 = 57
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 = 46, Item 1 = 51, Item 2 = 22

We want to allocate the items such that each agent gets the maximum possible total value while also considering fairness. One common approach is to maximize the sum of the minimum satisfaction for each agent.

Let's analyze possible allocations:

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, Items 0 and 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0 gets Item 1: Value = 64
   - Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2: Value = 46 + 22 = 68

2. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1, Items 1 and 2 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 gets Items 1 and 2: Value = 64 + 57 = 121
   - Agent 1 gets Item 0: Value = 46

3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0, Items 0 and 1 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0 gets Item 2: Value = 57
   - Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 1: Value = 46 + 51 = 97

Option 2 provides the highest value for both agents, but it gives Agent 0 a significantly higher value than Agent 1, which may not be considered fair. Option 1 offers a more balanced distribution of value between the agents while ensuring each agent receives items. 

Thus, the fair allocation, considering both maximum value and fairness, is:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
