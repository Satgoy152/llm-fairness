Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2
0  74  70  80
1  32  85  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents using the concept of envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they perceive as at least as good as any other agent's bundle, according to their own valuation.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 74
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 2: 80

- Agent 1 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 23

To start, we can calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 74 + 70 + 80 = 224
- Total value for Agent 1: 32 + 85 + 23 = 140

Let's consider the allocation that maximizes the perceived value for each agent while ensuring each agent does not envy the other.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Receives items 0 and 2. 
  - Total value: 74 (Item 0) + 80 (Item 2) = 154
- **Agent 1**: Receives item 1.
  - Total value: 85 (Item 1)

This allocation ensures that:
- Agent 0's allocation (154) is greater than Agent 1's allocation (85), according to Agent 0's valuation.
- Agent 1's allocation (85) is greater than Agent 0's perceived value of that item (70), according to Agent 1's valuation.

This allocation maximizes each agent's valuation for their received items and maintains envy-freeness under the given constraints.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
