Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2
0  58  84   8
1  87  18  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as the allocation of any other agent.

Let’s examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 1: 84
  - Item 2: 8
  
- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 87
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 69

First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 58 + 84 + 8 = 150
- Total value for Agent 1: 87 + 18 + 69 = 174

To ensure envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items in such a way that each agent feels they are receiving at least as much value as the other agent does.

Possible allocations:

1. **Initial Evaluation:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 the most, at 84.
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 the most, at 87.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value = 84 for Agent 0)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (value = 87 for Agent 1)
   - The remaining item, Item 2, should be allocated taking into account the remaining values:
     - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 8
     - Agent 1 values Item 2 at 69

Given the remaining values, it’s more beneficial to allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 because it increases their total perceived value significantly more than it would for Agent 0.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: [1] (Value: 84)
- Agent 1: [0, 2] (Value: 87 + 69 = 156)

This allocation ensures that neither agent envies the other, as each feels their allocation is as valuable as the other's.

**JSON Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
