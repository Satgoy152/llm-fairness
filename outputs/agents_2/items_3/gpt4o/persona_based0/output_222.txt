Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2
0  21  64  59
1  97  95  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. We will aim for a division where no agent feels that another agent's allocation is better based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as: 21, 64, 59
- Agent 1 values items as: 97, 95, 79

Let's calculate how each agent values different allocations and choose an allocation that maximizes fairness.

### Possible Allocations:

1. **Agent 0 gets item 0, Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 21
   - Agent 1's total value: 95 + 79 = 174

2. **Agent 0 gets item 1, Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 64
   - Agent 1's total value: 97 + 79 = 176

3. **Agent 0 gets item 2, Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 59
   - Agent 1's total value: 97 + 95 = 192

4. **Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1, Agent 1 gets item 2:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 21 + 64 = 85
   - Agent 1's total value: 79

5. **Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2, Agent 1 gets item 1:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 21 + 59 = 80
   - Agent 1's total value: 95

6. **Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2, Agent 1 gets item 0:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 64 + 59 = 123
   - Agent 1's total value: 97

### Fairness Analysis:

- Allocations 1, 2, and 3 give Agent 1 significantly higher total value compared to Agent 0.
- Allocations 4, 5, and 6 offer more balance but still favor Agent 0 in terms of total value.

The most balanced allocation in terms of minimizing envy seems to be:

- Agent 0 gets item 1, Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.

This allocation gives Agent 0 a valuation of 64, while Agent 1 gets a total valuation of 176, which is less balanced than desired. However, it is the best allocation where each agent gets an integer number of items, and no agent can be given a combination of items that would make them better off without making the other worse off.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
