Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2
0  33  99  49
1  13  40   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 99
  - Item 2: 49

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 13
  - Item 1: 40
  - Item 2: 3

A straightforward method to achieve envy-freeness in this scenario is to allocate the items such that each agent receives the items they value the most, if possible.

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

1. **Item 1** should be allocated to **Agent 0** because Agent 0 values it the highest (99 vs. 40 for Agent 1).

2. **Item 0** should be allocated to **Agent 0** because Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 1 (33 vs. 13).

3. **Item 2** should be allocated to **Agent 1** because Agent 1 does not receive any item yet, and this item is valued less by Agent 0 compared to other items.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value the most out of the remaining items, minimizing envy.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
