Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2
0  55  37  41
1  34  13  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 37
  - Item 2: 41

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 60

We will try to allocate the items in a way that both agents feel they have received a fair share based on their preferences, with the goal of minimizing envy.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 60, which is the highest valuation among all items for Agent 1. 
   - Agent 0 values it at 41.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 55, which is the highest valuation among all items for Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values it at 34.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 37.
   - Agent 1 values it at 13.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

### Resulting Allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1, with a total valuation of 55 + 37 = 92.
- Agent 1 gets item 2, with a total valuation of 60.

This allocation is fair in terms of maximizing each agent's satisfaction given the integer item constraint. Agent 0 ends up with two items, but their combined value is still less than the sum of the highest individual valuations for Agent 1.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
