Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2
0  35  61  53
1  78  17  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 17 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 35 
  - Item 1: 61 
  - Item 2: 53

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 17
  - Item 2: 88

To achieve envy-freeness, we should try to allocate items such that no agent prefers the allocation of the other agent over their own.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 and Items 1 and 2 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 1 gets Item 0 with a value of 78.
   - Agent 0 gets Items 1 and 2 with a total value of 61 + 53 = 114.

2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 and Items 0 and 2 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 1 with a value of 61.
   - Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2 with a total value of 78 + 88 = 166.

3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 and Items 0 and 1 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 1 gets Item 2 with a value of 88.
   - Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 1 with a total value of 35 + 61 = 96.

Considering the allocations, the second allocation strategy provides a more balanced and fair distribution:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1 with a value of 61.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2 with values of 78 and 88, totaling 166.

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 is not envious of Agent 1, as Agent 0 receives Item 1, which they value the most among the available options for a single item. Although Agent 1 receives more total value, Agent 0 cannot receive more than one item due to the constraints, so this allocation balances the perceived fairness.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
