Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2
0  13  56  59
1  44  15  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to each item and allocate items in a way that minimizes envy. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels that their allocation is fair based on their valuation.

Given the valuation table:

| Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  |
|--------------|----|----|----|
| 0            | 13 | 56 | 59 |
| 1            | 44 | 15 | 65 |

Here's how we can approach the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (59), followed by item 1 (56), and item 0 the least (13).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (65), followed by item 0 (44), and item 1 the least (15).

To achieve envy-freeness, we can try to allocate the items in a way that each agent receives items whose total value is maximized from their perspective while maintaining fairness.

A possible fair allocation is:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as both agents value it the highest, but Agent 1 values it more (65 vs. 59).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it significantly more than Agent 1 does (56 vs. 15).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it increases their total valuation without causing envy, and Agent 1 already has item 2.

This allocation results in the following total valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, with a total valuation of 13 + 56 = 69.
- Agent 1 receives item 2, with a total valuation of 65.

Agent 0 ends up with a slightly higher total valuation, but since Agent 1 has their most valued item, the allocation is envy-free from Agent 1's perspective.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
