Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2
0   3   5  87
1  90  94  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [90 94 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can try to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints.

The valuation matrix given is:

| Agent \ Item | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|--------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Agent 0      |   3    |   5    |   87   |
| Agent 1      |  90    |  94    |   66   |

To achieve a fair division, we aim to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness in this context means that no agent prefers the allocation of items given to the other agent over their own allocation. We will consider each agent's valuation of the items to achieve this.

### Possible Allocation:
1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (87), assigning it to them reduces potential envy.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 1 the most (94), so it makes sense to allocate Item 1 to them.
3. **Remaining Item**: Item 0 is left, and Agent 1 values it more (90) than Agent 0 does (3), so it would be fair to allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

This allocation minimizes envy because:
- Agent 0 receives the item they value the most.
- Agent 1 receives the two items they value more than Agent 0 does.

### Final Allocation:
Agent 0 gets Item 2, and Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 1.

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
