Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2
0  99  58  61
1   1  59  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we are aiming for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received the best possible set of items given their valuations. Our goal is to allocate all three items between the two agents such that no agent envies the other.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 61

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 1
  - Item 1: 59
  - Item 2: 44

One approach to ensure an envy-free allocation is to maximize the total perceived value for each agent. We need to assign items such that each agent perceives they have the highest possible value.

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 and Items 1, 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0 receives Item 0: Total value = 99
   - Agent 1 receives Items 1, 2: Total value = 59 + 44 = 103

   This allocation is not envy-free because Agent 0 would envy Agent 1, who has a higher total value.

2. **Allocate Items 0, 2 to Agent 0 and Item 1 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0 receives Items 0, 2: Total value = 99 + 61 = 160
   - Agent 1 receives Item 1: Total value = 59

   Agent 1 would envy Agent 0 in this case.

3. **Allocate Items 0, 1 to Agent 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0 receives Items 0, 1: Total value = 99 + 58 = 157
   - Agent 1 receives Item 2: Total value = 44

   Again, Agent 1 would envy Agent 0.

4. **Allocate Items 1, 2 to Agent 0 and Item 0 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0 receives Items 1, 2: Total value = 58 + 61 = 119
   - Agent 1 receives Item 0: Total value = 1

   Agent 1 would envy Agent 0 in this allocation.

5. **Allocate Items 0, 2 to Agent 1 and Item 1 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 receives Item 1: Total value = 58
   - Agent 1 receives Items 0, 2: Total value = 1 + 44 = 45

   In this scenario, Agent 0 might envy Agent 1 because of the higher number of items, but not due to value.

A truly envy-free solution for this set of valuations is difficult given the constraints. However, considering the possible allocations, we can distribute the items to balance the perceived value to some extent:

Allocate:
- Item 0 to Agent 0
- Items 1, 2 to Agent 1

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Total value = 99
- Agent 1: Total value = 59 + 44 = 103

Though Agent 0 might envy Agent 1 because Agent 1's total value is slightly higher, this allocation provides a reasonable balance given the constraints.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
