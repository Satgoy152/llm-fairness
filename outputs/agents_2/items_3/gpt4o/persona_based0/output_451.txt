Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2
0  62  67  79
1  31  32  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we refer to the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own.

Here is the breakdown of the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 62
  - Item 1: 67
  - Item 2: 79

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 32
  - Item 2: 28

To find an envy-free allocation, we need to ensure that each agent is at least as happy with their own allocation as they would be with the other's.

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 79.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 32.

Let's try an allocation based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

- Allocate item 2 to agent 0 (since it is their highest valued item).
- Allocate item 0 to agent 0 (second highest valued item for agent 0).
- Allocate item 1 to agent 1 (highest valued item for agent 1).

This allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2: Total value = 62 + 79 = 141
- Agent 1 receives item 1: Total value = 32

Now, check for envy-freeness:

- Agent 0 values agent 1's allocation at 67, which is less than 141, so agent 0 does not envy agent 1.
- Agent 1 values agent 0's allocation at 31 + 28 = 59, which is more than 32, but given the constraint of three items, this is the best allocation.

Thus, the allocation is fair under the given constraints:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
