Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2
0  21  65  72
1  81  70  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to analyze the valuations given by each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items so that neither agent envies the allocation of the other.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 21
  - Item 1: 65
  - Item 2: 72

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 81
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 2: 98

Let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0 = 21 + 65 + 72 = 158
- Total value for Agent 1 = 81 + 70 + 98 = 249

To ensure a fair division, we aim to maximize each agent's perceived value from their allocated items. Since Agent 1 has higher valuations across all items, we need to carefully balance the distribution to avoid envy.

An optimal solution considering these valuations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it more significantly (81 vs. 21).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as this is the highest value item for Agent 0 (65), and still provides decent value to Agent 1 (70).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it significantly more (98 vs. 72).

This allocation minimizes potential envy as each agent receives the item(s) they value most.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 one item they value relatively highly, while Agent 1 receives two items with higher valuations, keeping the allocation fair and envy-free based on the given values.
