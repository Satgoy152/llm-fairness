Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2
0  63  68  57
1  42  89  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. An envy-free allocation means that each agent feels they are at least as well-off with their own bundle of items as they would be with any other agent's bundle, given their valuations.

Let's evaluate the total valuation by each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 63
  - Item 1: 68
  - Item 2: 57
  - Total: 63 + 68 + 57 = 188

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 42
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 70
  - Total: 42 + 89 + 70 = 201

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can consider giving each agent the item(s) they value most. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highest (68) and item 0 second highest (63).
- Agent 1 values item 1 highest (89) and item 2 second highest (70).

A possible allocation strategy that minimizes envy:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 because they value it significantly higher than Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 as they value it more than Agent 1.
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it more than Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the distribution respects their preferences, thereby minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
