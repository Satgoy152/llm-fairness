Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2
0  18  76  65
1  49  62  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item. The goal is to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as the allocation of the other agent.

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 1: 76
  - Item 2: 65
  - Total valuation: 18 + 76 + 65 = 159

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 49
  - Item 1: 62
  - Item 2: 16
  - Total valuation: 49 + 62 + 16 = 127

To find an envy-free allocation, we need to ensure that each agent gets an allocation they value at least as much as the other's allocation. 

One approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations each agent places on them. Let's consider the following allocation:

1. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0. This is the item Agent 0 values the most (76).
2. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1. This is the item Agent 1 values the most (49).
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0. This is the next highest item Agent 0 values (65).

Now let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1 and 2
  - Total value for Agent 0: 76 (Item 1) + 65 (Item 2) = 141

- Agent 1 receives item: 0
  - Total value for Agent 1: 49 (Item 0)

In this allocation, both agents receive at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 3. Agent 0 values their allocation (141) more than Agent 1's allocation (49), and Agent 1 values their allocation (49) which matches their highest value item. This ensures that the allocation is envy-free.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
