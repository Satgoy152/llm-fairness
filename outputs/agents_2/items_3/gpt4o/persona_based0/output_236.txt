Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2
0  51  31  19
1  27  54  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total satisfaction or minimizing envy. Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 51
- Item 1: 31
- Item 2: 19

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 27
- Item 1: 54
- Item 2: 97

To strive for a fair division, we need to consider an allocation where each agent perceives that they are receiving a fair share, considering their personal valuations. One approach is to allocate the items such that the difference in perceived values between the agents is minimized.

Let's consider the possible allocations:

1. Allocate each agent the item they value the most:
   - Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 51)
   - Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 97)
   - This leaves item 1 (value 31 for agent 0 and 54 for agent 1)

To decide who gets item 1, we can compare the remaining values:
- If item 1 goes to Agent 0, the total value for Agent 0 is 51 + 31 = 82
- If item 1 goes to Agent 1, the total value for Agent 1 is 97 + 54 = 151

In this scenario, giving item 1 to Agent 1 results in a higher total value, but it creates an imbalance in perception of fairness. However, it ensures Agent 1 gets the item they value the most, and Agent 0 still receives an item they value significantly.

Given the valuations and striving for a fair approach, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0: item 0
- Agent 1: items 1 and 2

This allocation minimizes envy and maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their respective valuations.

The JSON allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
