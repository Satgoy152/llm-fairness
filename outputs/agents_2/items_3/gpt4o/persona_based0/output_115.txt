Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2
0  16  28  21
1   3  46  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1) while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible based on the given valuations. 

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0 assigns values: 16, 28, 21 to items 0, 1, 2 respectively.
- Total value for Agent 0: 16 + 28 + 21 = 65

- Agent 1 assigns values: 3, 46, 97 to items 0, 1, 2 respectively.
- Total value for Agent 1: 3 + 46 + 97 = 146

Given these valuations, Agent 1 highly values item 2, while Agent 0 has a more balanced valuation across all items. 

A reasonable strategy is to allocate item 2 to Agent 1, maximizing their satisfaction, while allocating items 0 and 1 to Agent 0, as they provide a more balanced satisfaction to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution of value is relatively balanced based on their individual preferences. 

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
