Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2
0  11  15  84
1  39  42  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an envy-free solution, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 11
  - Item 1 at 15
  - Item 2 at 84

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 39
  - Item 1 at 42
  - Item 2 at 17

To achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the highest valued item for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest (84).
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (42).

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations while ensuring no envy:**
   - Give Item 2 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valued item.
   - Give Item 1 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item.

3. **Allocate the remaining item:**
   - Item 0 is left. Agent 1 values Item 0 higher than Agent 0 (39 vs. 11).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy. Agent 0 receives their highest valued item, and Agent 1 receives two items they value more than Agent 0 does.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
