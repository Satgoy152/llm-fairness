Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2
0  51  96  26
1  91  93  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while taking into account their valuations, we can consider using the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (51), Item 1 (96), Item 2 (26)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (91), Item 1 (93), Item 2 (83)

We need to allocate the 3 items (0, 1, 2) between the two agents such that both are satisfied with their allocations.

1. **Calculating Total Valuation for each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: \(51 + 96 + 26 = 173\)
   - Agent 1: \(91 + 93 + 83 = 267\)

2. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 1 values each item more highly than Agent 0 does. To achieve envy-freeness, we need to consider both total value and individual preferences.

3. **Potential Allocations:**
   - Since Agent 1 values items significantly higher, we might start by giving Agent 1 the most valuable item according to their own valuation.

4. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value 96 for Agent 0).
   - Allocate Item 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1 (values 91 and 83).

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Item 1 (value 96)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (value 91) and Item 2 (value 83)

**Checking for Envy-Freeness:**
- Agent 0 receives value of 96. If Agent 0 had Agent 1's items (0 and 2), the total value would be 51 + 26 = 77, which is less than 96.
- Agent 1 receives value of 91 + 83 = 174. If Agent 1 had Agent 0's item (1), the value would be 93, which is less than 174.

Thus, this allocation is envy-free and respects each agent's preferences based on their valuations.

**Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
  "0": [1],
  "1": [0, 2]
}
```
