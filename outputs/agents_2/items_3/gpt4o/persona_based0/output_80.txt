Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2
0   8  66  59
1  50  19  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair amount of value based on their valuations. 

Let's examine the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 8
- Item 1: 66
- Item 2: 59

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 50
- Item 1: 19
- Item 2: 46

A good way to approach this is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that no agent envies another. We need to consider the sum value each agent receives for the items allocated to them.

### Possible Allocations and Their Analysis:

**Allocation 1:**
- Agent 0 receives Item 1
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2

**Values:**
- Agent 0: 66 (only Item 1)
- Agent 1: 50 + 46 = 96 (Items 0 and 2)

In Allocation 1, Agent 0 receives their highest-valued item, which is Item 1. Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2, which collectively provide a higher value compared to just receiving Item 1 alone (96 vs. 19). This allocation seems reasonable because neither agent can receive a higher value without making the other worse off, given the constraints.

**Checking Envy-Freeness:**
- Agent 0 does not envy Agent 1 because they value Item 1 at 66, which is higher than their valuation of receiving Items 0 and 2 together (8 + 59 = 67).
- Agent 1 does not envy Agent 0 because they receive a total value of 96 from Items 0 and 2, which is higher than their valuation of receiving only Item 1 (19).

Thus, this allocation is envy-free.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, each agent receives an integer number of items, and the distribution is envy-free based on the given valuations.
