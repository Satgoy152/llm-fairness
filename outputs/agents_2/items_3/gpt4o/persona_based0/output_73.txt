Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2
0  53  27  88
1  77  10  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to fairly allocate the items to the agents such that each agent feels their allocation is satisfactory given their valuations. One common approach to achieve envy-freeness in this context is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: Item 0 = 53, Item 1 = 27, Item 2 = 88
- Agent 1 values items as follows: Item 0 = 77, Item 1 = 10, Item 2 = 48

Our goal is to allocate the items to the agents such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation, and no agent envies another agent's allocation.

One feasible approach is:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 because it has a higher valuation (77 vs. 53).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 because it has a higher valuation (27 vs. 10).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 because it has a higher valuation (88 vs. 48).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total valuation for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
