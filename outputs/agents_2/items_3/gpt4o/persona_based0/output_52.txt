Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2
0  88  11  89
1  22  19  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to make sure that the allocation is as fair as possible and minimizes envy between the agents. In this specific context, we will ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 88, Item 1 at 11, Item 2 at 89.
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 22, Item 1 at 19, Item 2 at 78.

The strategy is to allocate items such that each agent gets the items they value most, while ensuring fairness and minimizing potential envy:

1. **Item 2**: Both agents value this item highly, but Agent 0 values it slightly more (89 vs. 78). Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0**: Again, Agent 0 values this item more than Agent 1 (88 vs. 22). Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 1**: This item is valued more by Agent 1 (19 vs. 11). Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives Agent 0 two items it values highly and Agent 1 the item they value more highly than Agent 0. This distribution minimizes the potential for envy, given the constraints.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
