Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2
0  45  13  30
1  12  61  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a manner that aims to achieve envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to allocate them so that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their preferences.

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 45
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 30

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 12
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 44

Given these valuations, we can use the following strategy to allocate the items:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item the most (61), while Agent 0 values it much less (13). Thus, it is reasonable to allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item significantly higher (45) than Agent 1 (12). Therefore, it should be allocated to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: This item is valued by Agent 0 at 30 and by Agent 1 at 44. Agent 1 has already received a high-value item (Item 1), so allocating Item 2 to Agent 0 helps balance the total value each agent receives, given Agent 0 would then receive items with total value 75, and Agent 1 would receive items with total value 61.

By following this allocation, both agents receive items they value highly, and the allocation seeks to maintain fairness based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
