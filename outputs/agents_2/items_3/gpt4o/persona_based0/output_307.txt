Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2
0   7  86  77
1  29  18  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29 18 55]]
Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim for an envy-free distribution, respecting integer constraints.

Here's the valuation matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   7    |   86   |   77   |
|   1   |   29   |   18   |   55   |

Let's analyze the situation:

- Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest (86) followed by Item 2 (77) and then Item 0 (7).
- Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest (55) followed by Item 0 (29) and then Item 1 (18).

To ensure envy-freeness, we should try to allocate items such that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent given their own valuation.

A potential fair allocation can be:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 because it has the highest valuation by Agent 0.
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 because it has the highest valuation by Agent 1.
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 as it is the next highest valuation for Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their own valuation given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
