Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2
0  36  91  73
1  95  79   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here are the given valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 36     | 91     | 73     |
| 1     | 95     | 79     | 6      |

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 36 + 91 + 73 = 200
- Agent 1's total valuation: 95 + 79 + 6 = 180

The goal is to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy. One way to do this is to allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns, considering the constraint of integer allocation.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 95, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 36.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 91, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 79.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 73, while Agent 1 values it at 6.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 for a better overall fit to balance their perceived values.

### Final Allocation

The allocations based on the above strategy are:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, potentially reducing envy.

### JSON Representation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```

This allocation balances the agents' preferences and values for the items, considering the goal of minimizing envy.
