Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2
0  72  84  50
1  46  93  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[72 84 50]
 [46 93 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable to them as the allocation given to the other agent.

Given the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 72
- Item 1: 84
- Item 2: 50

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 46
- Item 1: 93
- Item 2: 72

First, let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all items:
- Agent 0's total valuation: 72 + 84 + 50 = 206
- Agent 1's total valuation: 46 + 93 + 72 = 211

To achieve an envy-free allocation, the approach is to allocate items such that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while ensuring no agent envies the other's allocation.

Based on the valuation table:
- Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest among all items (93), so it makes sense to allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values Item 0 the highest after Item 1 (72), so allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
- This leaves Item 2, which will be allocated to Agent 0 as Agent 1 already has a higher total valuation with Item 1 alone compared to Agent 0's total.

Thus, the allocation is:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.

This allocation ensures:
- Agent 0 has a combined value of 72 (Item 0) + 50 (Item 2) = 122.
- Agent 1 has a value of 93 (Item 1).

Both agents have received allocations that maximize their preferences without envying the other, given the constraints.

The final allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
