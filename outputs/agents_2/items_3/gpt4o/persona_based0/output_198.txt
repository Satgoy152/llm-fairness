Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2
0  29  45  22
1  85  90  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while minimizing envy, we need to consider their valuations for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations, ideally achieving envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 29, Item 1 at 45, Item 2 at 22.
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 85, Item 1 at 90, Item 2 at 94.

A common approach to achieve a fair division is to maximize each agent's total satisfaction based on their valuations. One way to do this is by using a method like the "Adjusted Winner" procedure, but since we have only two agents and three items, a simpler allocation can be made by direct comparison.

Given the high values Agent 1 places on all items compared to Agent 0, it might be beneficial to allocate the most valued item per agent to them, which minimizes potential envy.

Let's proceed with a possible allocation:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it the most (94).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, since it's the highest valued item left for Agent 0 (45).
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 also values it significantly (85).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0 and Item 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
