Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2
0   1  75  18
1  39   5  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives an allocation they perceive as fair based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 1
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 18

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 39
  - Item 1: 5
  - Item 2: 65

A common criterion to achieve a fair allocation is the "Envy-Free" criterion, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Item 1** is highly valued by Agent 0 (75) and less by Agent 1 (5). Allocating Item 1 to Agent 0 minimizes potential envy from Agent 0.
2. **Item 2** is highly valued by Agent 1 (65) and less by Agent 0 (18). Allocating Item 2 to Agent 1 minimizes potential envy from Agent 1.
3. **Item 0** is moderately valued by both agents, but more by Agent 1 (39) compared to Agent 0 (1). Allocating Item 0 to Agent 1 maximizes the total valuation.

Here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 gets Item 1.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2.

This allocation is fair and envy-free because:
- Agent 0 receives the item they value most.
- Agent 1 receives items that maximize their total valuation without causing envy from Agent 0, given the constraints.

Now, presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
