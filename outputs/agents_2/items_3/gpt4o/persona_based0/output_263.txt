Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2
0  27  57  88
1   0  92  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we want to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness implies that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what any other agent has received, based on their own valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 27, Item 1 = 57, Item 2 = 88
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 0, Item 1 = 92, Item 2 = 94

We want to allocate the 3 items in a manner that maximizes each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Allocate Item 2:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 88, while Agent 1 values it at 94.  
   - To reduce envy, allocate Item 2 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it.

2. **Allocate Item 1:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 57, while Agent 1 values it at 92.
   - However, since Agent 1 has already received the most valued item (Item 2), allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 to balance the allocation.

3. **Allocate Item 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 27, while Agent 1 values it at 0.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 1 places no value on it.

### Final Allocation

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2.

This allocation should minimize envy, given the constraints and the valuations of the items by each agent.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
