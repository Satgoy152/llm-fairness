Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2
0  48  88  98
1  70   9  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0 at 48
  - Item 1 at 88
  - Item 2 at 98

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 70
  - Item 1 at 9
  - Item 2 at 48

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should ensure that each agent gets at least one of their higher valued items if possible, and the total value perceived by each agent for their allocation is as close as possible. 

Step 1: Identify the highest valued item for each agent.
- Agent 0's highest valued item is Item 2 (98).
- Agent 1's highest valued item is Item 0 (70).

Step 2: Allocate the highest valued item to each agent if feasible.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

Step 3: Allocate the remaining item, Item 1.
- Item 1 is more valuable to Agent 0 (88) than to Agent 1 (9). Therefore, allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent has no envy of the other's allocation, as each agent receives their most preferred available items given the other's allocation.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
