Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2
0  43  68  79
1  51  19  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation with the goal of minimizing envy between agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for the items. The concept of envy-freeness suggests that each agent should feel that they have received the best possible allocation given the circumstances.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 43, Item 1 = 68, Item 2 = 79
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 51, Item 1 = 19, Item 2 = 94

We can approach the allocation by considering each agent's preferences and finding a way to assign items such that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

1. **Agent 0's perspective:**
   - Agent 0's highest-valued item is Item 2 (79).
   - The next highest-valued item is Item 1 (68).

2. **Agent 1's perspective:**
   - Agent 1's highest-valued item is Item 2 (94).
   - The next highest-valued item is Item 0 (51).

Given these preferences, we aim to allocate the items to minimize envy. One way to do this is by ensuring that each agent gets their most valued item, if possible, while balancing the total valuation each agent receives.

To achieve a fair allocation:
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as it is their most valued item.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as it is one of their top choices and avoids giving Agent 1 a highly valued item for Agent 0.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as it balances Agent 0's total valuation.

This results in the following allocation:
- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value highly, and it minimizes potential envy since each agent receives their highest or nearly highest-valued items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
