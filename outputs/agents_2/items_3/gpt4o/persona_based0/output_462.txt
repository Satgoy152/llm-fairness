Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2
0  99  57  62
1  43  38  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuation matrix and attempt to give each agent items that maximize their individual valuation while minimizing any potential envy.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

```
    Items
      0   1   2
0  99  57  62
1  43  38  11
```

The goal is to assign all 3 items in a way that each agent ends up with an allocation that they value highly and ideally, the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints. 

One possible approach is to:

1. Allocate item 0 to agent 0 because agent 0 has the highest valuation (99) for this item. 
2. Allocate item 1 to agent 0 because agent 0 has a higher valuation (57) than agent 1 (38).
3. Allocate item 2 to agent 1 because although agent 0 values it more (62) than agent 1 (11), it leaves agent 1 with at least one item and agent 0 already has significant value from the first two items.

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's perceived value while ensuring all items are distributed. 

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
