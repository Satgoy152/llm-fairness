Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2
0  64  83  72
1  97  24  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we are aiming for an envy-free allocation if possible. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 83
  - Item 2: 72

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 1: 24
  - Item 2: 64

A straightforward approach would be to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, if possible:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 97, while Agent 0 values it at 64. Agent 1 should get Item 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it higher at 83 compared to Agent 1's valuation of 24. Agent 0 should get Item 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 72, while Agent 1 values it at 64. Agent 0 should get Item 2.

This allocation ensures that:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2, which they value at 83 and 72, respectively.
- Agent 1 receives item 0, which they value at 97.

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives a total valuation of 155 (83 + 72).
- Agent 1 receives a total valuation of 97.

Both agents do not envy each other's allocations since each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the other's allocation.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
