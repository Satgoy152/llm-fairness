Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2
0  77  85  76
1  88  31  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and then attempt to distribute the items in a way that is consistent with these valuations.

We have the following valuations:

- Agent 0:  
  - Item 0: 77
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 76
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 77 + 85 + 76 = 238

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 88
  - Item 1: 31
  - Item 2: 33
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 88 + 31 + 33 = 152

To achieve a fair allocation, we want to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that reflects their relative valuations. One approach is to use a method that attempts to divide items such that no agent envies the other's allocation.

In this case, let's evaluate the best possible allocation given the valuations:

- Agent 0 seems to value Item 1 (85) the most, followed by Item 0 (77) and then Item 2 (76).
- Agent 1 values Item 0 (88) the most, followed by Item 2 (33) and then Item 1 (31).

Given these preferences, a possible envy-free allocation is:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it the most.
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it highly and more than Agent 1 does.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it higher than Agent 1 does.

This allocation should minimize envy because each agent gets at least one of their most valued items, and Agent 1 gets their highest valued item.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
