Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2
0   4  59  51
1  44  88  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the items to the agents in a way that is fair and envy-free, if possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 4      | 59     | 51     |
| 1     | 44     | 88     | 62     |

Let's consider the agents' preferences based on their valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (59), followed by item 2 (51), and then item 0 (4).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (88), followed by item 2 (62), and then item 0 (44).

We aim for a fair distribution, potentially minimizing envy. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: This is the highest-valued item for both agents, but Agent 1 values it significantly higher than Agent 0 (88 vs. 59).

2. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: This item is the second-highest valued for Agent 0 and also highly valued for Agent 1, but Agent 0 values it almost as much as Agent 1 (51 vs. 62).

3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: Although this item is least valued among all items, Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 (44 vs. 4).

This allocation can be considered fair in terms of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent, given the constraints.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
``` 

This allocation gives Agent 0 item 2 and Agent 1 items 0 and 1. This distribution is based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent and is a reasonable attempt at minimizing potential envy.
