Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2
0   1  77  63
1  63  52  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will analyze the valuations given by each agent for the items. Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, based on their valuations.

Here is the table of valuations:

```
    Item
       0   1   2
Agent 
0     1  77  63
1    63  52  54
```

Let's consider the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 1 + 77 + 63 = 141
- Agent 1: 63 + 52 + 54 = 169

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can consider the following steps:

1. Allocate the most valued item for each agent and review remaining items.
2. Aim for balance where possible by ensuring that each agent gets items they value highly.

From the table:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (77).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (63).

To balance these allocations:
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

Now, consider item 2:
- Agent 0 values item 2 at 63.
- Agent 1 values item 2 at 54.

Since Agent 0 has already received item 1, which they value the most, and Agent 1 has received item 0, which they value the most, we can allocate item 2 to Agent 0 to balance the overall happiness:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

Now the allocations are:

- Agent 0: items 1 and 2
- Agent 1: item 0

This allocation should be envy-free given the highest valued items are distributed according to preferences.

The final allocations in the requested JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
