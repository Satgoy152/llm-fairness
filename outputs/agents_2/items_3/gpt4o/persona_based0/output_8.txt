Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2
0  15  54  99
1  37  88  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we need to compare the valuations and assign the items in a way that minimizes envy between the agents.

The valuations are as follows:
- Agent 0 values the items at: [15, 54, 99]
- Agent 1 values the items at: [37, 88, 93]

We can see:
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it higher than agent 0 (37 vs 15).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it higher than agent 0 (88 vs 54).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it higher than agent 1 (99 vs 93).

To ensure a fair and envy-free allocation, we can follow these steps:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 because they value it higher.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 because they value it higher.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 because they value it higher.

This allocation minimizes envy because each agent receives the items they value more compared to the other agent.

The final allocation is:
- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1.

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
