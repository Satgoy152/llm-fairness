Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2
0  88  82  72
1  54  29  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 88
  - Item 1: 82
  - Item 2: 72

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 54
  - Item 1: 29
  - Item 2: 89

Now, let's consider potential allocations:

1. **Allocate based on highest value per agent**:
   - Agent 0 should receive Item 0 (value 88 for Agent 0, higher than any other item for Agent 0).
   - Agent 1 should receive Item 2 (value 89 for Agent 1, highest value).

2. **Allocate the remaining item**:
   - The remaining item is Item 1.
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 82.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 at 29.

Since Agent 0 values Item 1 more than Agent 1 does, it makes sense to allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

Resulting allocation:
- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2.

This allocation minimizes envy because each agent receives the item they value the most highly, and Agent 0 receives the remaining item, which they value more than Agent 1 does.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
