Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2
0  45  17  90
1  86  40  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we are considering an envy-free allocation if possible, and also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent envies another, meaning each agent should feel that they receive at least as much value as any other agent given the allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 45, Item 1 = 17, Item 2 = 90.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 86, Item 1 = 40, Item 2 = 25.

The total value each agent assigns to all items:
- Agent 0: 45 + 17 + 90 = 152
- Agent 1: 86 + 40 + 25 = 151

To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy, we will allocate based on the maximum value each agent assigns to an item, while also ensuring each item is assigned and that there are no fractional allocations.

1. Start by assigning the item that has the highest individual value for each agent.
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (90).
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 the most (86).

2. Assign these items to the respective agents:
   - Agent 0 receives Item 2.
   - Agent 1 receives Item 0.

3. The remaining item is Item 1.
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 17.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 at 40.

Since Agent 1 values the remaining item (Item 1) more than Agent 0 does, it is reasonable to allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

This allocation should reduce envy, as each agent receives their highest-valued item, and Agent 1 receives an additional item that they value more than Agent 0 does.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
