Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2
0  25  19  97
1  23  24  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to look at their valuations for each item. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by the other agent over their own bundle.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 25
  - Item 1: 19
  - Item 2: 97

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 23
  - Item 1: 24
  - Item 2: 66

From these valuations, we can observe the following:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 significantly higher than the other items, with a valuation of 97. 
2. Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 2 as well, at 66, but it's still lower than Agent 0's.
3. For item 0, Agent 0 values it slightly higher than Agent 1 (25 vs. 23).
4. For item 1, Agent 1 values it slightly higher than Agent 0 (24 vs. 19).

To ensure a fair allocation, we can consider assigning:

- Item 2 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for them.
- Item 1 to Agent 1, since they value it slightly higher than Agent 0.
- Item 0 can go to Agent 1, as this balances the total value of the bundles for both agents more evenly.

This allocation considers the highest value preference of Agent 0 for item 2 and balances the remaining items between the agents to ensure fairness.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
