Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2
0  84   9  86
1  17  36  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their individual valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness. Envy-freeness in this context means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own, given their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 84
- Item 1: 9
- Item 2: 86

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 17
- Item 1: 36
- Item 2: 49

To achieve envy-freeness, we consider the highest valuations each agent has to ensure they receive items they value highly. The goal is to allocate items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation compared to the other agent's allocation.

1. Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest (86), so it would be reasonable to allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (36), so it would be reasonable to allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Now, we have Item 0 left to allocate. Agent 0 values Item 0 at 84, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 17. Allocating Item 0 to Agent 0 would result in the highest satisfaction for Agent 0 without creating envy from Agent 1, who already has their highest valued item (Item 1).

Based on this reasoning, the allocation that appears to be envy-free is:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item they value highly, minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
