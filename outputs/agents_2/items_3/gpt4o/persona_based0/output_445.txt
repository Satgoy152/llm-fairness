Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2
0  94  87  44
1   5  98  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 3 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share given their valuations. In this scenario, we'll aim to maximize each agent's perceived value of the items they receive.

Let's first consider the total value each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0: Values item 0 at 94, item 1 at 87, and item 2 at 44.
  - Total value = 94 + 87 + 44 = 225

- Agent 1: Values item 0 at 5, item 1 at 98, and item 2 at 98.
  - Total value = 5 + 98 + 98 = 201

To divide these items fairly, we need to consider the highest value each agent assigns to any item and try to allocate based on maximizing these values while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Step-by-step allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 since it is the highest value (98) that matches Agent 1's preference.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 since it is the highest value (94) that matches Agent 0's preference.
3. For the remaining item (item 2), we need to decide between the two agents. Agent 0 values it at 44 and Agent 1 values it at 98. However, Agent 1 already received item 1, which is very high in value for them. To balance and ensure a fair division, assign item 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that Agent 1 receives the items they value close to their highest preference, while Agent 0 also receives an item they value highly. Although Agent 0 ends up with fewer items, the allocation is envy-free because Agent 0 receives a high-value item that they preferred.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
