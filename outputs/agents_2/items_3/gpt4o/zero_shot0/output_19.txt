Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2
0  37  41  68
1  31  72  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [31 72 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the table and the valuations:

```
    0   1   2
0  37  41  68
1  31  72  33
```

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 37
  - Item 1: 41
  - Item 2: 68

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 33

To maximize fairness, we try to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation is maximized given their preferences.

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 68.
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 at 33.

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 41.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 at 72.

3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 37.
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 31.

After allocation, the items are distributed as follows:
- Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets Item 1.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items based on their highest valuations for those items. The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
