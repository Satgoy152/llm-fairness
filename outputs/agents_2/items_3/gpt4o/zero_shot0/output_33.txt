Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2
0  86  68  90
1   3  20  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the valuations provided in the table to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their total value. The goal is to distribute the items such that both agents are satisfied with their allocation based on their valuations.

Here are the steps to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **List Item Values for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values:
     - Item 0: 86
     - Item 1: 68
     - Item 2: 90
   - Agent 1 values:
     - Item 0: 3
     - Item 1: 20
     - Item 2: 34

2. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent if Given All Items:**
   - Agent 0 total value if given all items: 86 + 68 + 90 = 244
   - Agent 1 total value if given all items: 3 + 20 + 34 = 57

3. **Determine the Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 should get items they value the most as they have a significantly higher total valuation. Since Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest, they should receive Item 2.
   - Agent 0 also values Item 0 quite highly, so they should receive Item 0.
   - Agent 1 has lower valuations overall, but they should receive Item 1, which is their next highest valued item after Item 2.

4. **Allocate Items:**
   - Agent 0 receives Item 0 and Item 2.
   - Agent 1 receives Item 1.

5. **Present the Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure that both agents receive items in a manner reflective of their valuations, maximizing fairness given the constraints.
