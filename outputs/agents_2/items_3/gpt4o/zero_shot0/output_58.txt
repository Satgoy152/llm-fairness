Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2
0  21  45  38
1  44  55  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can adopt a method that maximizes each agent's valuation for the items they receive. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Identify Total Valuation:** Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items combined.
   - Agent 0: 21 + 45 + 38 = 104
   - Agent 1: 44 + 55 + 35 = 134

2. **Allocate Items Based on Preference:**
   - Compare the valuations for each item individually and assign the item to the agent who values it more.

3. **Item-by-Item Allocation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 values it at 44. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 values it at 55. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 38, Agent 1 values it at 35. Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 2.
   - Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1.

5. **Present the Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the allocation is based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent.
