Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2
0  55  47  88
1  72  43  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations while also making sure that each agent gets an integer number of items. In this case, we have 2 agents and 3 items to allocate.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 at 55, item 1 at 47, and item 2 at 88.
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 72, item 1 at 43, and item 2 at 50.

To determine a fair allocation, we can attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. We can use a simple method by comparing the total valuation each agent has for all items and then allocating items to maximize their satisfaction.

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

   - Agent 0: 55 + 47 + 88 = 190
   - Agent 1: 72 + 43 + 50 = 165

2. Consider the allocation of items:

   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 because they derive the highest value from it (88).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 because they derive the highest value from it (72).
   - For item 1, assign it to Agent 0, as it has a slightly higher value for them (47) compared to Agent 1 (43).

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 is assigned items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 is assigned item 0.
