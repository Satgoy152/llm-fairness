Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2
0   0  70  11
1  12  22  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while considering fairness. Hereâ€™s one way to do it:

1. **Calculate the Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: \(0 + 70 + 11 = 81\)
   - Agent 1: \(12 + 22 + 73 = 107\)

2. **Assign Items to Agents Based on Value:**
   - For each item, assign it to the agent who values it the most.
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 12, Agent 0 at 0. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 at 22. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 73, Agent 0 at 11. Assign to Agent 1.

3. **Verify Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 1.
   - Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.

Now, we can present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
