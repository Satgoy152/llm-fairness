Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2
0  71  17  48
1  77  62  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 62 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's summarize their valuations and determine an allocation strategy.

### Valuations Table:
- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: 71
  - Item 1: 17
  - Item 2: 48

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 77
  - Item 1: 62
  - Item 2: 85

### Strategy:
1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item** and allocate it to the agent who values it the most.
2. **Maximize the total value for each agent** by ensuring each agent receives the items they value most.

### Allocation:
- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it higher (77 vs. 71), allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it higher (62 vs. 17), allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it higher (85 vs. 48), allocate to Agent 1.

### Result:
Since all items are valued higher by Agent 1, they will receive all items in this scenario. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives all items to Agent 1 based on their higher valuations for each item. Agent 0 does not receive any items in this particular valuation scenario.
