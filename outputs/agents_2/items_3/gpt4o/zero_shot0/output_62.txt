Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2
0  61   8  86
1  49  12  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since we have 2 agents and 3 items, one agent will receive 2 items and the other will receive 1 item. 

Let's evaluate possible allocations based on the given valuations:

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: Item 0 = 61, Item 1 = 8, Item 2 = 86
- Agent 1: Item 0 = 49, Item 1 = 12, Item 2 = 21

### Possible Allocations:

1. **Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, Agent 1 receives item 1:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 61 (item 0) + 86 (item 2) = 147
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 12 (item 1)

2. **Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, Agent 1 receives item 2:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 61 (item 0) + 8 (item 1) = 69
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 21 (item 2)

3. **Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2, Agent 1 receives item 0:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 8 (item 1) + 86 (item 2) = 94
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 49 (item 0)

4. **Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2, Agent 0 receives item 1:**
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 49 (item 0) + 21 (item 2) = 70
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 8 (item 1)

5. **Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1, Agent 0 receives item 2:**
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 49 (item 0) + 12 (item 1) = 61
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 86 (item 2)

6. **Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2, Agent 0 receives item 0:**
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 12 (item 1) + 21 (item 2) = 33
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 61 (item 0)

### Optimal Allocation
The allocation that maximizes the total valuations for both agents is:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, Agent 1 receives item 1.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
