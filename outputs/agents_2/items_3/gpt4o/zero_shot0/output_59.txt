Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2
0  22  71  17
1   4  64  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. The goal is to allocate items such that each agent ends up with an integer number of items, and the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations.

In this scenario, we have 2 agents (0 and 1) and 3 items (0, 1, and 2). Here's the valuation table:

| Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  |
|--------------|----|----|----|
| 0            | 22 | 71 | 17 |
| 1            | 4  | 64 | 25 |

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 1**: This item has the highest individual valuation, and agent 0 values it at 71, which is higher than agent 1's valuation of 64. Hence, item 1 should be allocated to agent 0.

2. **Item 0**: Next, agent 0 values item 0 at 22, which is significantly higher than agent 1's valuation of 4. Therefore, item 0 should also be allocated to agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: Finally, we need to allocate item 2. Agent 1 values item 2 at 25, which is higher than agent 0's valuation of 17. Thus, item 2 should be allocated to agent 1.

This allocation aims to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
