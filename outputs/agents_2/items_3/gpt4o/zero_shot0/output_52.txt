Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2
0  91  35  91
1  77  68  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we need to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring both agents get at least one item. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Valuations Summary**:
   - Agent 0 values:
     - Item 0: 91
     - Item 1: 35
     - Item 2: 91
   - Agent 1 values:
     - Item 0: 77
     - Item 1: 68
     - Item 2: 14

2. **Total Valuation for Each Item**:
   - Item 0: 91 (Agent 0) + 77 (Agent 1) = 168
   - Item 1: 35 (Agent 0) + 68 (Agent 1) = 103
   - Item 2: 91 (Agent 0) + 14 (Agent 1) = 105

3. **Allocating Items**:
   - To maximize fairness, we should consider the items that each agent values the most.
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 and Item 2 the highest (both at 91), so we allocate these two items to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (at 68), so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 2.
   - Agent 1 gets Item 1.

Given this allocation, here is the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
