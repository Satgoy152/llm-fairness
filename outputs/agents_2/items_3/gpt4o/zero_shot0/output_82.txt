Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2
0  61  81  96
1  60   0  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items. In this case, there are two agents and three items.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: Item 0 (61), Item 1 (81), Item 2 (96)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: Item 0 (60), Item 1 (0), Item 2 (21)

We can start by considering the highest value items for each agent and try to balance the allocation:

### Allocation Strategy
- Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (96), followed by Item 1 (81), and then Item 0 (61).
- Agent 1 values Item 0 the most (60), followed by Item 2 (21), and has no interest in Item 1 (0).

Given these valuations, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 1 has zero value for it).

This way, each agent receives one or more items, and the total value is fairly distributed according to their preferences.

    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
