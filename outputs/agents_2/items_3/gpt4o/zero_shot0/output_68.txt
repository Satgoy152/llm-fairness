Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2
0   4  70  93
1  18  75  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. We have two agents (0 and 1) and three items (0, 1, and 2) with their respective valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 4
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 2: 93

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 87

To find a fair allocation, let's attempt to maximize the total satisfaction based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0 is valued higher by Agent 1 (18) than Agent 0 (4). So, assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Item 1 is valued higher by Agent 1 (75) than Agent 0 (70), but the difference is small. Since we need to be fair, let's consider the allocation of Item 2 first.
3. Item 2 is valued higher by Agent 0 (93) than Agent 1 (87). Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Now, we have one item left, Item 1. Given that Agent 0 already has Item 2, and Agent 1 has Item 0, we assign Item 1 to Agent 1 to balance the total values.

This allocation ensures that both agents get a fair share based on their valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
