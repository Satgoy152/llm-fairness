Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2
0   6  19  67
1  98  84  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: Item 0 = 6,  Item 1 = 19, Item 2 = 67
Agent 1: Item 0 = 98, Item 1 = 84, Item 2 = 70
```

We need to assess the values to allocate items such that each agent's satisfaction is maximized. Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign the item with the highest value to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (67). Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Assign the remaining items based on their highest value.
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 the most (98), and the second most is Item 1 (84).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 gets Item 2.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 1.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the distribution is based on maximizing the value for each agent given the constraint.
