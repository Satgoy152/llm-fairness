Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2
0  83  78  80
1  55  30  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we consider the valuations provided for each item by each agent. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by giving each agent the items they value the most.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 83
  - Item 1 at 78
  - Item 2 at 80

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 55
  - Item 1 at 30
  - Item 2 at 37

To ensure fairness and maximize each agent's satisfaction, we can assign the items as follows:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it higher (83) than Agent 1 does (55).
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it higher (80) than Agent 1 does (37).
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 because Agent 0 already has two items, and Agent 1 values Item 1 (30) more than nothing.

Now, each agent has a fair share considering their valuations:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 2]
- Agent 1 gets item [1]

Therefore, the final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
