Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2
0  33  95  54
1  61  77  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [61 77 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we should ensure that each agent receives the items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent. In this case, we'll consider two agents (0 and 1) and three items (0, 1, and 2). 

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 95
  - Item 2: 54

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 61
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 80

We will allocate the items to maximize total satisfaction. The optimal allocation can be determined by comparing the valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values this more (61 vs 33).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values this more (95 vs 77).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values this more (80 vs 54).

Based on these valuations, a fair allocation would be:

- Agent 0 gets Item 1.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2.

Now, let's present these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
