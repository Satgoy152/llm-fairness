Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2
0  93  56  24
1  13  46  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [13 46 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives the items in a way that maximizes their total valuation while giving each agent an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: Item 0 = 93, Item 1 = 56, Item 2 = 24
Agent 1: Item 0 = 13, Item 1 = 46, Item 2 = 84
```

We can determine the potential best allocation by looking for the highest valuations for each item and assigning them to the respective agents:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 93, whereas Agent 1 values it at 13. It should go to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 56, whereas Agent 1 values it at 46. It should go to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 24, whereas Agent 1 values it at 84. It should go to Agent 1.

Based on the valuations, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets Item 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value received by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.
