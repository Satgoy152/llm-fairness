Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2
0  98  67  46
1   5  65  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98 67 46]
 [ 5 65 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction while making sure each agent gets an integer number of items. In this case, we have 2 agents and 3 items.

Given the valuations:
- Agent 0 values the items as [98, 67, 46].
- Agent 1 values the items as [5, 65, 93].

The goal is to allocate the items such that the total value for each agent is maximized.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's evaluate each item:
- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 98, and Agent 1 values it at 5. Agent 0 should get Item 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 67, and Agent 1 values it at 65. Agent 0 should get Item 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 46, and Agent 1 values it at 93. Agent 1 should get Item 2.

### Allocations:
- Agent 0 gets items [0, 1].
- Agent 1 gets item [2].

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total satisfaction based on the valuations is maximized.
