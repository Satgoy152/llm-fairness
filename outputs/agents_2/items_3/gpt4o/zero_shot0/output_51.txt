Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2
0  70  46  82
1  28  94  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[70 46 82]
 [28 94 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 70
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 82

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 28
  - Item 1: 94
  - Item 2: 15

Let's consider allocating each item to the agent that values it the most:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 70, and Agent 1 values it at 28. Thus, allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 46, and Agent 1 values it at 94. Thus, allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 82, and Agent 1 values it at 15. Thus, allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

With this allocation, Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2, and Agent 1 receives Item 1. This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent.

The final allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
