Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2
0   3  12  88
1  71  15  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a set of items that maximizes their total valuation while also ensuring each agent receives at least one item (if the number of items is equal to the number of agents). In this scenario, we have 2 agents and 3 items.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (3), Item 1 (12), Item 2 (88)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (71), Item 1 (15), Item 2 (58)

Let's calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation:

1. Allocate Item 0 and 1 to Agent 0, and Item 2 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0: 3 (Item 0) + 12 (Item 1) = 15
   - Agent 1: 58 (Item 2)

2. Allocate Item 0 and 2 to Agent 0, and Item 1 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0: 3 (Item 0) + 88 (Item 2) = 91
   - Agent 1: 15 (Item 1)

3. Allocate Item 1 and 2 to Agent 0, and Item 0 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0: 12 (Item 1) + 88 (Item 2) = 100
   - Agent 1: 71 (Item 0)

From these allocations, we can see that the most balanced allocation (considering maximizing each agent's total value) would be:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1
- Allocate Item 1 and 2 to Agent 0

This allocation ensures that both agents have at least one item and maximizes Agent 0's total value significantly, as Agent 1 already has a high valuation for Item 0.

Now, present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
