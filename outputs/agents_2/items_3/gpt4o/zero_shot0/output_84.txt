Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2
0  65  87  46
1  59  76  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [59 76 99]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we'll consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total satisfaction of both agents.

Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **List the valuations**:
   - Agent 0 values: [65, 87, 46]
   - Agent 1 values: [59, 76, 99]

2. **Identify each agent's highest valued item**:
   - Agent 0's highest valuation is for item 1 (87).
   - Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 2 (99).

3. **Allocate the highest valued item to each agent**:
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Allocate the remaining item**:
   - The remaining item is item 0.
   - Compare the valuations for item 0:
     - Agent 0 values item 0 at 65.
     - Agent 1 values item 0 at 59.
   - Since Agent 0 values item 0 more, allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

5. **Resulting allocation**:
   - Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
   - Agent 1 gets item 2.

Now, presenting the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and maximizes the total satisfaction based on the given valuations.
