Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2
0  99  46  27
1  80  50  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can approach this problem using a simple heuristic method such as the "greedy" approach, which allocates the items to the agent who values them most, one by one. Hereâ€™s how we can do it:

1. **List the items with their valuations by each agent:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 values it at 80.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 46, Agent 1 values it at 50.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 27, Agent 1 values it at 44.

2. **Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (99 > 80), so allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (50 > 46), so allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (44 > 27), so allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Resulting allocation:**

   - Agent 0 gets item 0.
   - Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2.

4. **Present the allocations in the specified JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items that they value the most, and each agent ends up with an integer number of items.
