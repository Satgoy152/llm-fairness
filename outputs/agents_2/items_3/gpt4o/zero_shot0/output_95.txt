Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2
0  60   3  24
1  81  89  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We have 2 agents and 3 items to allocate.

Here is a strategy to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Value for item 0: 60
   - Value for item 1: 3
   - Value for item 2: 24

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Value for item 0: 81
   - Value for item 1: 89
   - Value for item 2: 65

Let's allocate the items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 81, which is higher than Agent 0's 60. So, item 0 goes to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 89, which is higher than Agent 0's 3. So, item 1 goes to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 65, which is higher than Agent 0's 24. However, to balance the allocation since Agent 1 already has two items, we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

Now, each agent has an integer number of items, and the allocation is relatively fair given the valuation differences.

The resulting allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
