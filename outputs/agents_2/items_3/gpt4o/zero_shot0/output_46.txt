Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2
0  23  86  17
1  14  50  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the total valuation each agent has for all items and aim to balance these valuations as evenly as possible among them. Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent and then allocate the items accordingly.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations

- **Agent 0**: 23 (Item 0) + 86 (Item 1) + 17 (Item 2) = 126
- **Agent 1**: 14 (Item 0) + 50 (Item 1) + 31 (Item 2) = 95

### Step 2: Allocate Items

To ensure a fair allocation, we aim to give each agent items such that their total valuations are as balanced as possible:

1. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0**: This item has the highest individual valuation for Agent 0 and a significant valuation gap compared to Agent 1.
2. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 1**: This item has the second-highest valuation for Agent 1 and balances with the remaining item.
3. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1**: This balances the total valuations after assigning the other two items.

### Final Allocations

- **Agent 0**: [1]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 2]

The result is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives as fairly as possible given the constraints.
