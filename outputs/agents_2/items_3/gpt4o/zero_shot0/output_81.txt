Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2
0  17  55  25
1  84  18  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences. We'll aim to distribute the items so that each agent gets an integer number of items, and each agent should ideally receive the items they value the most. Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 17
- Item 1: 55
- Item 2: 25

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 84
- Item 1: 18
- Item 2: 45

To maximize the total value for each agent, we can follow these steps:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most, if possible.
2. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. If conflicts arise (two agents want the same item), consider the overall distribution to maintain fairness.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Identify the highest valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 the most (55).
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 the most (84).

2. Assign the highest valued items:
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. Allocate the remaining items:
   - Agent 0 is left with the choice between Item 0 and Item 2. Since Agent 1 already has Item 0, assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Item 2 is left for Agent 1.

Based on these steps, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items while maximizing their individual valuations. Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2, while Agent 1 receives item 0.
