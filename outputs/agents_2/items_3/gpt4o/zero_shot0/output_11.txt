Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2
0  74  97  65
1  49  76  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 76 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction (or value) each agent gets from the items they receive. We'll evaluate the valuations from each agent for each item and allocate accordingly.

Given the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2
0  74  97  65
1  49  76  42
```

We have two agents (0 and 1) and three items (0, 1, 2). Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 74.
   - Agent 1 values it at 49.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (since 74 > 49).

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 97.
   - Agent 1 values it at 76.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (since 97 > 76).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 65.
   - Agent 1 values it at 42.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (since 65 > 42).

Thus, based on the highest valuation principle, Agent 0 will receive all the items since their valuations for each item are higher than Agent 1's.

Final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed based on the highest value each agent assigns to them. Agent 0 ends up with all the items since their valuations are consistently higher for each item compared to Agent 1.
