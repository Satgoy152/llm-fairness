Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2
0  57  75  45
1  38  23  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[57 75 45]
 [38 23 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can follow the idea of maximizing the total value each agent receives. Let's analyze the given valuations and distribute the items:

Given Valuations Table:
```
    0   1   2
0  57  75  45
1  38  23  76
```

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 57.
   - Agent 1 values it at 38.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 75.
   - Agent 1 values it at 23.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 45.
   - Agent 1 values it at 76.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

### Final Allocations

Based on the above strategy, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives. Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1, while Agent 1 gets item 2.
