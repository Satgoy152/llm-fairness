Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2
0  57  55  56
1  98  95  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. In this case, we have 2 agents and 3 items:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 57  
- Item 1: 55  
- Item 2: 56  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 98  
- Item 1: 95  
- Item 2: 40  

One fair allocation could be to try and maximize the total value for each agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values it the highest (98).
2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values it highly (95) compared to Agent 0.
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 values it more (56).

This gives us the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 0, Item 1

Now, presenting this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and aims to maximize their total valuation.
