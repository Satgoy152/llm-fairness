Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2
0  67  35  33
1  81  22  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: 67 (Item 0) + 35 (Item 1) + 33 (Item 2) = 135
   - Agent 1: 81 (Item 0) + 22 (Item 1) + 34 (Item 2) = 137

2. **Allocate Items Based on Maximum Valuation:**

   - For Item 0:
     - Agent 0 values it at 67.
     - Agent 1 values it at 81.
     - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (since 81 > 67).

   - For Item 1:
     - Agent 0 values it at 35.
     - Agent 1 values it at 22.
     - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (since 35 > 22).

   - For Item 2:
     - Agent 0 values it at 33.
     - Agent 1 values it at 34.
     - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (since 34 > 33).

3. **Allocate the Items:**

   - Agent 0 receives Item 1.
   - Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2.

4. **Present the Allocations:**

   ```json
   {
       "0": [1],
       "1": [0, 2]
   }
   ```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes their total valuation based on the given values.
