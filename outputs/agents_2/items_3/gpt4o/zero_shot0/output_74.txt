Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2
0  27   9  73
1  77  65  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use an algorithm such as the "Maximum Nash Welfare" or simply try to balance the total valuation each agent receives. In this case, we have two agents and three items, and the goal is to distribute the items in a way that is fair based on their valuations.

Let's first examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [27, 9, 73]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [77, 65, 84]

Now, let's consider different allocations and calculate the total valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0 gets items: [0, 1], Agent 1 gets item: [2]**
   - Agent 0's total valuation = 27 + 9 = 36
   - Agent 1's total valuation = 84

2. **Agent 0 gets items: [0, 2], Agent 1 gets item: [1]**
   - Agent 0's total valuation = 27 + 73 = 100
   - Agent 1's total valuation = 65

3. **Agent 0 gets item: [1], Agent 1 gets items: [0, 2]**
   - Agent 0's total valuation = 9
   - Agent 1's total valuation = 77 + 84 = 161

4. **Agent 0 gets item: [2], Agent 1 gets items: [0, 1]**
   - Agent 0's total valuation = 73
   - Agent 1's total valuation = 77 + 65 = 142

Among these allocations, let's choose the one which is most balanced in terms of total valuation received by each agent. Option 1 seems to be the most balanced considering the total valuation each agent receives.

Therefore, the allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 1]
- Agent 1 gets item: [2]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
