Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2
0  89  95  66
1  69  52  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. In this scenario, we have 2 agents and 3 items. 

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 95
  - Item 2: 66

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 69
  - Item 1: 52
  - Item 2: 69

To allocate the items fairly, we can use a simple allocation strategy that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives. A common strategy is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 89, while Agent 1 values it at 69. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 95, while Agent 1 values it at 52. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 66, while Agent 1 values it at 69. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, while Agent 1 receives item 2.
