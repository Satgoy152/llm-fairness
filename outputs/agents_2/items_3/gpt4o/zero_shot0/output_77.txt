Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2
0  90  87  30
1  97  82  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here, we have two agents (0 and 1) and three items (0, 1, and 2). 

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 90, Item 1 at 87, Item 2 at 30
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 97, Item 1 at 82, Item 2 at 80

Given this, we aim to allocate the items such that the total perceived value for each agent is maximized. One common approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

1. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it at 97, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 90. So, allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 87, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 82. So, allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 1 values it at 80, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 30. So, allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives Item 1, and Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items while maximizing their respective valuations.
