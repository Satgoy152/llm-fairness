Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2
0   2  68  44
1  83  96  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that maximizes the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, we have two agents (0 and 1) and three items (0, 1, and 2).

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuation: Item 0 (2), Item 1 (68), Item 2 (44)
   - Total Valuation: 2 + 68 + 44 = 114

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Valuation: Item 0 (83), Item 1 (96), Item 2 (91)
   - Total Valuation: 83 + 96 + 91 = 270

Given that Agent 1 has significantly higher valuations compared to Agent 0, it would be fair to allocate the higher valued items to Agent 1 to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's allocate the items:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it at 83 and Agent 0 values it at 2).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it at 96 and Agent 0 values it at 68).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it at 44 and Agent 1 values it at 91).

Now, each agent has received an integer number of items as required. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items while considering their valuations.
