Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2
0  79  53   5
1  37   2  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim for a distribution that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the given valuations and make allocations accordingly:

Valuations table:
```
    Item
    0   1   2
0  79  53   5
1  37   2  25
```

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: Item 0 (79), Item 1 (53), Item 2 (5)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: Item 0 (37), Item 1 (2), Item 2 (25)

A fair allocation can be achieved by assigning the items based on the highest value preference for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0:** 
  - Highest value by Agent 0 (79), second highest by Agent 1 (37).
  - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

- **Item 1:**
  - Highest value by Agent 0 (53), second highest by Agent 1 (2).
  - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

- **Item 2:**
  - Highest value by Agent 1 (25), second highest by Agent 0 (5).
  - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures both agents receive an integer number of items, with Agent 0 receiving two items and Agent 1 receiving one item. 

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
