Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2
0  65  73  87
1  21  25  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's first calculate the total value each agent would receive for each possible allocation and then choose the allocation that provides a balanced distribution.

We have two agents (0 and 1) and three items (0, 1, and 2). The goal is to allocate these items such that:

1. Each agent receives an integer number of items.
2. The allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations.

**Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations for Each Possible Allocation**

- **Allocation 1:** Agent 0 receives items [0, 1], and Agent 1 receives item [2].
  - Agent 0's total value: 65 (item 0) + 73 (item 1) = 138
  - Agent 1's total value: 42 (item 2) = 42

- **Allocation 2:** Agent 0 receives items [0, 2], and Agent 1 receives item [1].
  - Agent 0's total value: 65 (item 0) + 87 (item 2) = 152
  - Agent 1's total value: 25 (item 1) = 25

- **Allocation 3:** Agent 0 receives items [1, 2], and Agent 1 receives item [0].
  - Agent 0's total value: 73 (item 1) + 87 (item 2) = 160
  - Agent 1's total value: 21 (item 0) = 21

- **Allocation 4:** Agent 0 receives item [0], and Agent 1 receives items [1, 2].
  - Agent 0's total value: 65 (item 0) = 65
  - Agent 1's total value: 25 (item 1) + 42 (item 2) = 67

- **Allocation 5:** Agent 0 receives item [1], and Agent 1 receives items [0, 2].
  - Agent 0's total value: 73 (item 1) = 73
  - Agent 1's total value: 21 (item 0) + 42 (item 2) = 63

- **Allocation 6:** Agent 0 receives item [2], and Agent 1 receives items [0, 1].
  - Agent 0's total value: 87 (item 2) = 87
  - Agent 1's total value: 21 (item 0) + 25 (item 1) = 46

**Step 2: Choose the Most Fair Allocation**

We should choose an allocation where both agents receive a relatively fair share based on their valuations:

- **Allocation 4** seems to be the most balanced, where Agent 0 and Agent 1 both receive a reasonable amount: 65 for Agent 0 and 67 for Agent 1.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
