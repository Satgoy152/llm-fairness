Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2
0  68  34  12
1  19  49  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on each item. In this case, we have 2 agents and 3 items. We can use a strategy known as the "Maximum Nash Welfare" which aims to maximize the product of utilities for a fair division.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 68, Item 1 at 34, Item 2 at 12
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 19, Item 1 at 49, Item 2 at 80

We need to allocate the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and we want the allocation to be fair based on their valuations. Here's a possible fair allocation:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it significantly higher (68 vs. 19).
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it significantly higher (80 vs. 12).
3. For Item 1, even though Agent 1 values it slightly higher (49 vs. 34), Agent 0 has already received one high-value item, so to balance the allocation slightly, we can give Item 1 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items, and each agent gets at least one high-value item according to their preferences.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
