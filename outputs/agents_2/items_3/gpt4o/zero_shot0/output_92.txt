Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2
0  86  55  81
1  58  61  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 61 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider their valuations for each item and aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We have two agents (0 and 1) and three items (0, 1, and 2). Below is the valuation matrix again for clarity:

|       | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| Agent 0 | 86     | 55     | 81     |
| Agent 1 | 58     | 61     | 68     |

Given that we have two agents and three items, our goal is to allocate these items fairly. One approach is to assign the items to the agents based on which agent values them more. Let's analyze this approach:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 86, and Agent 1 values it at 58. We allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 55, and Agent 1 values it at 61. We allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 81, and Agent 1 values it at 68. We allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it more, thus maximizing the total value for each agent.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
