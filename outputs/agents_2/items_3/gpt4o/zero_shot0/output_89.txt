Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2
0  35  38  20
1  69  12  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We have two agents (0 and 1) and three items (0, 1, and 2). The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is the valuation matrix for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 35     | 38     | 20     |
| 1     | 69     | 12     | 15     |

We can use a simple approach to allocate items based on the highest valuation first:

1. For Item 0, Agent 1 has a higher valuation (69) compared to Agent 0 (35).
2. For Item 1, Agent 0 has a higher valuation (38) compared to Agent 1 (12).
3. For Item 2, Agent 0 has a higher valuation (20) compared to Agent 1 (15).

Based on the valuations, the allocations are as follows:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 2, with a total value of 38 + 20 = 58.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0, with a total value of 69.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
