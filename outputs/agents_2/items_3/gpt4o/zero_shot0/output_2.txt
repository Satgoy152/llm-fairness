Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2
0  93   8   6
1  74  14  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [74 14 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. We need to ensure each agent gets a fair share, while also considering their individual valuations.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 93
  - Item 1 at 8
  - Item 2 at 6

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 74
  - Item 1 at 14
  - Item 2 at 66

We need to allocate each item to one of the agents in such a way that the distribution is fair and each agent gets a reasonable value based on their preferences.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 93
   - Agent 1 values it at 74
   - Allocate to Agent 0 because 93 > 74

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 8
   - Agent 1 values it at 14
   - Allocate to Agent 1 because 14 > 8

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 6
   - Agent 1 values it at 66
   - Allocate to Agent 1 because 66 > 6

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0]
- Agent 1 gets items: [1, 2]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
