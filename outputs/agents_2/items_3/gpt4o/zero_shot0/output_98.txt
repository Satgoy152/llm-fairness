Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2
0  15  93   7
1  76  42  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [76 42 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0:
Item 0: 15
Item 1: 93
Item 2: 7

Agent 1:
Item 0: 76
Item 1: 42
Item 2: 71
```

To maximize fairness, we should try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction (valuation) of each agent. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** values Item 1 the most (93), so we can allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values Item 0 the most (76), so we can allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
- For Item 2, Agent 1 values it more (71) compared to Agent 0 (7), so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocations would be:
- Agent 0 gets Item 1.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2.

Now, let's format this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation means that Agent 0 gets Item 1, and Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2, which maximizes fairness based on their valuations.
