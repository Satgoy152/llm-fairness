Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0  1   2
0  13  0  91
1  90  8  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [90  8 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction for all agents. One way to do this is to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and the distribution of total value is as equal as possible.

Let's analyze the given table:

```
    0  1   2
0  13  0  91
1  90  8  92
```

Agent 0 values:
- Item 0: 13
- Item 1: 0
- Item 2: 91

Agent 1 values:
- Item 0: 90
- Item 1: 8
- Item 2: 92

Each agent needs to receive at least one item. We will try to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent.

Possible allocations:
- Agent 0 should receive item 2 because that's their highest valuation (91).
- Agent 1 should receive item 0 because that's their highest valuation (90).
- We are left with item 1, which has a valuation of 0 for agent 0 and 8 for agent 1. Thus, item 1 should be allocated to agent 1.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 0 and Item 1

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
