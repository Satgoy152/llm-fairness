Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2
0  62  29  35
1  71  85   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we need to consider the total value each agent places on the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction of both agents. Here is a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate the Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 62 (item 0) + 29 (item 1) + 35 (item 2) = 126
   - Agent 1: 71 (item 0) + 85 (item 1) + 4 (item 2) = 160

2. **Identify Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most, followed by item 2, and then item 1.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most, followed by item 0, and then item 2.

3. **Allocate Items Based on Preferences:**
   - Since Agent 1 values item 1 the highest, allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Since Agent 0 values item 0 the highest, allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Finally, allocate item 2, which is valued more by Agent 0 than Agent 1, to Agent 0.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
   - Agent 1 receives item 1.

5. **Ensure Each Agent Gets an Integer Number of Items:**
   - Both agents receive a fair distribution of items according to their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
