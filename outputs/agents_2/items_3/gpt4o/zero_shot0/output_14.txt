Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2
0  70  77  11
1  63  41  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and attempt to maximize the total satisfaction of both agents. This can be approached as a fair division problem, often exploring methods like maximizing the sum of valuations or ensuring each agent receives a bundle of items that they value as much as possible relative to the other agent's valuations.

Here's a breakdown of the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 70
  - Item 1 at 77
  - Item 2 at 11

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 63
  - Item 1 at 41
  - Item 2 at 68

To allocate these items, we'll try to maximize the total satisfaction:

1. Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest (77), and Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest (68).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1.
3. For Item 0, Agent 0 values it higher (70) than Agent 1 (63), so assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

Thus, the allocation could be:
- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
