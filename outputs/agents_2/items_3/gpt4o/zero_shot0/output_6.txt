Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2
0  14  15  23
1  98  66  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**  
   For Agent 0: \( 14 + 15 + 23 = 52 \)  
   For Agent 1: \( 98 + 66 + 83 = 247 \)

2. **Determine Proportional Fair Share:**  
   Total Valuation: \( 52 + 247 = 299 \)  
   Proportional fair share for Agent 0: \( \frac{52}{299} \) of the total items  
   Proportional fair share for Agent 1: \( \frac{247}{299} \) of the total items

3. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation Preference:**  
   Since there are only 3 items and 2 agents, we look to allocate items based on maximizing the agents' individual valuations. This can lead to a practical allocation.

4. **Allocation Process:**  
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 98, which is higher than Agent 0’s 14.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 66, which is higher than Agent 0’s 15.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 83, which is higher than Agent 0’s 23.

   Agent 1 has higher valuations for all items, but we need to allocate one item to Agent 0 due to fairness and the need for each agent to receive some items. We'll consider giving Agent 0 the item where the difference in valuation is the least.

5. **Final Allocation:**  
   - Give Item 2 to Agent 0 (Agent 1 values it at 83 and Agent 0 at 23, which is the smallest difference compared to other items).
   - Give Items 0 and 1 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values these the highest).

This allocation gives Agent 0 one item and Agent 1 two items, while trying to respect the overall valuations as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
