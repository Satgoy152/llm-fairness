Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2
0  70  60  27
1  24  87  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can approach this problem by aiming to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of a possible allocation:

1. **List the valuations:**

   | Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
   |-------|--------|--------|--------|
   | 0     | 70     | 60     | 27     |
   | 1     | 24     | 87     | 88     |

2. **Determine the highest value each item is perceived at:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 values it at 24. Agent 0 values it higher.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 values it at 87. Agent 1 values it higher.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 27, Agent 1 values it at 88. Agent 1 values it higher.

3. **Allocate based on highest value:**

   - Item 0 is allocated to Agent 0.
   - Item 1 is allocated to Agent 1.
   - Item 2 is allocated to Agent 1.

Given these allocations, we can see that each agent receives the items they value the most:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.

4. **Present the allocations in the required JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total value for each agent is maximized based on their preferences.
