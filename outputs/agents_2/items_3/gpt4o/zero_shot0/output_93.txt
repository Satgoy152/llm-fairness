Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2
0  18  64  60
1  62  63  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One way to do this is to use a simple heuristic: allocate items to the agent who values them the most.

Here is the breakdown of the values each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: Item 0 = 18, Item 1 = 64, Item 2 = 60.
- Agent 1 values items as follows: Item 0 = 62, Item 1 = 63, Item 2 = 39.

To allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 18.
   - Agent 1 values it at 62.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 since 62 > 18.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 64.
   - Agent 1 values it at 63.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 since 64 > 63.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 60.
   - Agent 1 values it at 39.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 since 60 > 39.

With this allocation, each agent gets one or more items, and the allocation maximizes the value for each agent based on their preferences.

The final allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
