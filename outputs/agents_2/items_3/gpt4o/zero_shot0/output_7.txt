Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2
0  32  50  66
1  76  20  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between agents 0 and 1, we want to ensure that each agent receives items such that their overall satisfaction or value is as balanced as possible given their preferences. Let's analyze the values for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations:
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 50
  - Item 2: 66

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 76
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 10

We aim to allocate the items such that both agents have a comparable total value. A straightforward approach is to maximize each agentâ€™s total value by assigning items they value most. 

Let's examine a possible allocation:

1. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 76, which is the highest value among all items for both agents.
   
2. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 50, which is the highest remaining value for Agent 0.
   
3. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**:
   - The remaining item, Agent 0 values it at 66, which is greater than Agent 1's value for it.

Now, let's check the total value each agent receives:

- **Agent 0**: Value of Item 1 (50) + Value of Item 2 (66) = 116
- **Agent 1**: Value of Item 0 (76)

Given this allocation, Agent 0 receives a total value of 116, and Agent 1 receives a total value of 76. This allocation is a fair distribution based on the highest possible total value each agent can receive given their preferences and the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
