Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2
0  87  21  59
1  89  51  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can employ a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. We should consider the preferences of each agent and try to allocate the items such that each agent receives the highest possible value from the items they get.

Let's look at the valuations:

```
Agent 0: Item 0 = 87, Item 1 = 21, Item 2 = 59
Agent 1: Item 0 = 89, Item 1 = 51, Item 2 = 23
```

We can start by allocating items to the agent who values them the highest:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 87.
   - Agent 1 values it at 89.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 since 89 > 87.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 21.
   - Agent 1 values it at 51.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 since 51 > 21.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 59.
   - Agent 1 values it at 23.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 since 59 > 23.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives Item 2, and Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1. This allocation considers the highest value each agent places on the items available, providing a fair distribution based on their preferences.
