Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0  1   2
0  85  4  75
1  24  0  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total happiness (valuation) for each agent. We need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are only two agents and three items, one agent will get two items, and the other will get one item.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has valuations for items: 
  - Item 0: 85 
  - Item 1: 4 
  - Item 2: 75

- Agent 1 has valuations for items:
  - Item 0: 24
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 57

To maximize fairness, we can use a method such as maximizing the minimum valuation each agent receives or using a strategic allocation such as envy-freeness if possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Highest Value Item First**: Allocate the item with the highest value to the agent who values it the most.
2. **Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items to balance the total valuation for each agent.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item the most (85 vs. 24). Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values this second highest (57 vs. 75). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 1**: The only item left. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 4 while Agent 1 values it at 0).

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1 gets Item 2

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
