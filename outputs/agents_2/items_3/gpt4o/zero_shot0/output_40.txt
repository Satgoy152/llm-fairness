Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2
0  81  37  39
1  71  11  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations of each item and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are two agents and three items, each agent should receive a fair share of the total valuation.

Here's a step-by-step process to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 81 (item 0) + 37 (item 1) + 39 (item 2) = 157
   - Agent 1: 71 (item 0) + 11 (item 1) + 76 (item 2) = 158

2. **Determine the Fair Share:**
   - Since there are two agents, each should ideally control about half the total value.
   - Total valuation = 157 (Agent 0) + 158 (Agent 1) = 315
   - Fair share per agent = 315 / 2 = 157.5

3. **Allocate Items Based on Valuations:**
   - Start by allocating the item with the highest valuation preference for each agent.
   - Ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total valuation.

4. **Item Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (81), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (76), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - The remaining item is item 1.

5. **Consider Remaining Item:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 37, while Agent 1 values it at 11.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 to balance the valuations.

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items [0,1]
   - Agent 1 receives item [2]

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the distribution considers the agents' preferences and attempts to fairly balance their total valuations.
