Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2
0  29  32  78
1   9  26  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. Let's allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [29, 32, 78]
Agent 1: [9, 26, 30]
```

We will allocate items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 29
   - Agent 1 values it at 9
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 32
   - Agent 1 values it at 26
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 78
   - Agent 1 values it at 30
   - Allocate to Agent 0

This allocation gives all three items to Agent 0 because these items have higher value for Agent 0 compared to Agent 1.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": []
}
```

This allocation gives all items to Agent 0, maximizing the total valuation and ensuring an integer number of items per agent. Agent 1 does not receive any items in this particular allocation because Agent 0's valuations are significantly higher for each item.
