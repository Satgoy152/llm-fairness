Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2
0   9  55  44
1  94  70  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 70 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to look at the valuations of each item by each agent and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we'll try to allocate the items to maximize fairness based on the agents' preferences.

Here is the valuation table for reference:

```
         0   1   2
Agent 0  9  55  44
Agent 1 94  70  18
```

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest with a value of 94.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the highest with a value of 70.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the highest with a value of 44.

Based on this analysis, a fair allocation would be:

- Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 1 because they have significantly higher valuations for these items.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 because they have the highest valuation for this item.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and maximizes the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.
