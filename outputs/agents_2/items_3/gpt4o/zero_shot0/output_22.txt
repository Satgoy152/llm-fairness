Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0  1   2
0  35  2  71
1  85  2  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuation matrix:

```
    0  1   2
0  35  2  71
1  85  2  94
```

We can follow an allocation strategy such as maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. Here is a step-by-step plan to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**
   - Item 0: 35
   - Item 1: 2
   - Item 2: 71

2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**
   - Item 0: 85
   - Item 1: 2
   - Item 2: 94

To fairly allocate these items, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences. Since Agent 1 values Item 2 the most, and Agent 0 values Item 0 the most, we can allocate those items accordingly. Item 1 has the least value for both agents, so we can allocate it to Agent 0 since Agent 1 is getting a higher value item.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 and Item 1
- **Agent 1**: Item 2

This allocation aims to distribute the items based on the highest value each agent assigns to an item and ensures each agent gets at least one item.

### JSON Format Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.

This allocation respects the constraint of each agent receiving an integer number of items and aims to fairly distribute the items based on their valuations.
