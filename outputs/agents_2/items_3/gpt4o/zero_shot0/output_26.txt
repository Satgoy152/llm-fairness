Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2
0  52  27  19
1  58   9  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction (or value) each agent gets from the items they receive. Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: Item 0 = 52, Item 1 = 27, Item 2 = 19
Agent 1: Item 0 = 58, Item 1 = 9,  Item 2 = 59
```

We can attempt to allocate the items such that the total value each agent receives is roughly equal, while each agent receives a whole number of items.

### Allocation Plan:

1. **Agent 1** seems to value Item 2 the most (59), and also values Item 0 quite highly (58). Allocating these two items to Agent 1 would give them a total value of 117.
2. **Agent 0** can receive Item 1, which they value at 27, and Item 0, which they value at 52. This gives Agent 0 a total value of 79.

This allocation gives Agent 1 a higher total value, but each agent receives an integer number of items, and this seems to be one of the most balanced distributions given the constraints.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total satisfaction for both agents while ensuring each agent receives a whole number of items.
