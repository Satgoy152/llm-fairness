Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2
0  91  81  44
1  34  59  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [34 59 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2
0  91  81  44
1  34  59  33
```

Let's go through a potential process to allocate these items:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 has higher valuations for all items compared to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most, followed by item 1, and then item 2.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most, followed by item 0, and then item 2.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign the highest valued items to each agent in a way that maximizes the total valuation.
   - Consider the relative valuations of items for each agent.

3. **Possible Allocation**:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 because it has the highest valuation for it and it maximizes Agent 0's total valuation.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because it maximizes Agent 1's total valuation and is the highest valued item for Agent 1.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it still provides some value to Agent 0 and Agent 1 values it the least.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
   - Agent 1 receives item 1.

Now, let's represent this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures both agents receive an integer number of items and the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations.
