Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2
0  13  13  32
1  45  48  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the valuations**:  
   - Agent 0 values items as follows:  
     - Item 0: 13  
     - Item 1: 13  
     - Item 2: 32  
   - Agent 1 values items as follows:  
     - Item 0: 45  
     - Item 1: 48  
     - Item 2: 65  

2. **Choose allocations to maximize fairness**:  
   - First, let's look at which item each agent values the most:
     - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (32).
     - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (65).
   - Since both agents value item 2 the most, we need to allocate other items to balance the total value.

3. **Allocate items**:
   - Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 1 since they value it much higher than Agent 0.
   - Next, allocate item 0 and item 1 to Agent 0 as they have the same value for these items and Agent 1 already received the item they value the most.

4. **Sum of allocated values**:
   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1: \(13 + 13 = 26\).
   - Agent 1 receives item 2: \(65\).

5. **Check for fairness**:
   - Each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. This allocation ensures that each agent's total valuation is maximized based on their preferences.

6. **JSON Output**:
   - Now, present the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation based on the given preferences.
