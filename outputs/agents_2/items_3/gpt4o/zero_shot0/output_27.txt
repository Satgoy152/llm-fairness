Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2
0  67  98  65
1  58  34  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67 98 65]
 [58 34 82]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: Examine each agent's valuation for each item.
2. **Maximize total value**: Assign items to agents to maximize their total received value.

Let's analyze the given valuation matrix:

```
     0   1   2
0  67  98  65
1  58  34  82
```

- Agent 0 values the items as: 
  - Item 0: 67
  - Item 1: 98
  - Item 2: 65

- Agent 1 values the items as:
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 1: 34
  - Item 2: 82

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (98) for Item 1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 2**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (82) for Item 2 than Agent 0 (65). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 0**: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (67) for Item 0 than Agent 1 (58). Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 1].
- Agent 1 gets item [2].

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent given the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items.
