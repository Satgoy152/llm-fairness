Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2
0  31  71  67
1  38  71   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocations are as fair as possible given the values each agent assigns to the items. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 31
  - Item 1 at 71
  - Item 2 at 67

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 38
  - Item 1 at 71
  - Item 2 at 6

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 1**: Both agents value this item the same (71), so it can go to either. To balance the overall values, let's allocate it to Agent 0 for now.

2. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this item higher (38) compared to Agent 0 (31), so allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item much higher (67) compared to Agent 1 (6), so allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

Now, let's look at the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.

This allocation is based on maximizing the total valuations for each agent. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
