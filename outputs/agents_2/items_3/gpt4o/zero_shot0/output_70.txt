Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2
0  69  30  23
1   4  79  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1) based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. Here's how we can proceed with the allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Agent:**
   - For agent 0, the total valuation for all items is 69 + 30 + 23 = 122.
   - For agent 1, the total valuation for all items is 4 + 79 + 59 = 142.

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Each Agent's Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (69), while Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (79).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 next highest (59), which is still higher than Agent 0's valuation of any remaining items.

3. **Decision:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 and items 1 and 2 to Agent 1. This way, each agent receives higher-valued items according to their preferences.

4. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 0.
   - Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2.

Finally, the allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
