Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

   0   1   2
0  7   2  16
1  2  89  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuations each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a whole number of items. Given the table:

| Agent/Item | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Agent 0    | 7      | 2      | 16     |
| Agent 1    | 2      | 89     | 78     |

We need to allocate the 3 items (0, 1, 2) to the 2 agents (0, 1). Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item**:
   - For Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 7, Agent 1 values it at 2. Higher valuation by Agent 0.
   - For Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 values it at 89. Higher valuation by Agent 1.
   - For Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 16, Agent 1 values it at 78. Higher valuation by Agent 1.

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuation**:
   - Item 0 goes to Agent 0.
   - Item 1 goes to Agent 1.
   - Item 2 goes to Agent 1.

3. **Review the allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [0]
   - Agent 1: [1, 2]

This allocation maximizes the total valuations agents receive for the items they are allocated. 

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
