Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2
0  48  85  83
1  48  69  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes fairness while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: 48 (Item 0) + 85 (Item 1) + 83 (Item 2) = 216
   - Agent 1: 48 (Item 0) + 69 (Item 1) + 57 (Item 2) = 174

2. **Determine Fair Allocations**:
   - Since there are only two agents and three items, one logical approach is to allocate two items to the agent with the higher total valuation and one item to the other.

3. **Allocate the Items**:
   - We aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's start by allocating the item with the highest valuation to each agent one by one.

   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (85), so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (69), but it's already allocated. Their next highest is item 0 at 48, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Now, allocate the remaining item (item 2) based on who would benefit more:
     - Agent 0 values item 2 at 83.
     - Agent 1 values item 2 at 57.
     - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 since they value it more.

4. **Resulting Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 1 receives item 0.

Here is the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets an integer number of items, and the distribution is as fair as possible given their valuations.
