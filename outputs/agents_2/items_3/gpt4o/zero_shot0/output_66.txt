Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2
0  99  94  46
1  42  96  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations provided and aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives a whole number of items. Given that we have two agents and three items, a balanced distribution would mean each agent gets a reasonably fair share of the total value.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: item 0 = 99, item 1 = 94, item 2 = 46
- Agent 1 values items as follows: item 0 = 42, item 1 = 96, item 2 = 43

We'll try to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's total perceived value, keeping in mind that:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (99) and item 1 (94).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (96).

A potential fair allocation would be:

- Give Agent 0 item 0 (valued at 99) and item 2 (valued at 46) for a total value of 145.
- Give Agent 1 item 1 (valued at 96) for a total value of 96.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations. Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
