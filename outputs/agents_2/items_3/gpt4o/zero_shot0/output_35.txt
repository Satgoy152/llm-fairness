Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2
0  57  16  98
1  99   5  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are two agents and three items, one agent will receive two items, and the other will receive one item.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 57
  - Item 1: 16
  - Item 2: 98

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 5
  - Item 2: 20

A fair allocation aims to distribute the items such that the total perceived value for each agent is maximized or balanced as equitably as possible. Here's a possible fair allocation strategy:

1. Agent 1 highly values Item 0 (99), while Agent 0 values it at 57. Hence, allocating Item 0 to Agent 1 maximizes its value.
2. Agent 0 highly values Item 2 (98), while Agent 1 values it at 20. Allocating Item 2 to Agent 0 maximizes its value.
3. The remaining item, Item 1, should be allocated to Agent 0, as it provides a slightly higher value to Agent 0 (16) than to Agent 1 (5).

Based on this analysis, the fair allocation would be:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
