Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2
0  55  83  63
1  49  62  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maximizing their valuations, we should consider their preferences and attempt to distribute items such that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible. Let's analyze and allocate the items accordingly.

The valuation matrix is:

```
    Items
    0   1   2
0  55  83  63
1  49  62  49
```

Each value represents how much each agent values each item. We need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and the distribution should be fair.

1. **Assigning Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 has a higher valuation for item 1 (83) compared to agent 1 (62). Assign item 1 to agent 0.

2. **Assigning Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 55, while agent 1 values it at 49. Agent 0 has a slightly higher valuation. However, to balance the allocations, we will consider agent 1 for this item since agent 0 already got item 1.

3. **Assigning Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 63, whereas agent 1 values it at 49. Agent 0 has a higher valuation, and since agent 1 received item 0, item 2 will go to agent 0.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
