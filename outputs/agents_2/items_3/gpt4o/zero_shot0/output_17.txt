Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2
0  91  30  62
1  53  94  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction for each agent.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations:
  - Item 0: 91
  - Item 1: 30
  - Item 2: 62

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 53
  - Item 1: 94
  - Item 2: 44

From these valuations, we can observe the following preferences:

- Agent 0 values Item 0 the highest (91), followed by Item 2 (62).
- Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (94), followed by Item 2 (44).

A fair allocation would attempt to give each agent the item they value the most. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 because it's highly valued by them (94).
2. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 because it's highly valued by them (91).
3. Allocate Item 2 to any agent. Since Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 1, we will allocate it to Agent 0.

Thus, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 1.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
