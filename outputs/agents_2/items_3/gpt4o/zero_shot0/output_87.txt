Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2
0  60  47  65
1  43  13  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents (agent 0 and agent 1), we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. There are three items (0, 1, and 2) to be allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: 60
  - Item 1: 47
  - Item 2: 65

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 43
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 14

To make a fair allocation, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value received by each agent. The goal is to allocate the items such that the total valuation is maximized for both agents.

### Allocating Items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it higher (60 vs. 43), so allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it higher (47 vs. 13), so allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it higher (65 vs. 14), so allocate to Agent 0.

In this case, Agent 0 receives all items because their valuations are consistently higher for every item.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": []
}
```

With this allocation, Agent 0 receives all items, which reflects each agent receiving an integer number of items.
