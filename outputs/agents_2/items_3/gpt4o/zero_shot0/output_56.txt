Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2
0  19  32   5
1  47  20  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[19 32  5]
 [47 20 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple method to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and try to maximize the total value for each agent. 

Given the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2
0  19  32   5
1  47  20  89
```

Let's break down the allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**
   - Item 0: 19
   - Item 1: 32
   - Item 2: 5

2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**
   - Item 0: 47
   - Item 1: 20
   - Item 2: 89

### Allocation Strategy:

- Start by assigning items based on the highest valuation for each item to ensure fairness and maximize satisfaction.
- Each agent should get at least one item.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Item 2 Allocation:**
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest at 89. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 0 Allocation:**
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 higher at 47 compared to Agent 0's 19. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 1 Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 higher at 32 compared to Agent 1's 20. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets Item 1.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
