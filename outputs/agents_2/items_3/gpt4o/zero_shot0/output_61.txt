Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2
0   2  65  63
1  27  64  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **List the Items and Valuations**:
   - Agent 0 valuations: Item 0 = 2, Item 1 = 65, Item 2 = 63
   - Agent 1 valuations: Item 0 = 27, Item 1 = 64, Item 2 = 93

2. **Determine Optimal Allocation**:
   - To maximize the total valuation across all agents, we need to compare the values each agent assigns to each item and allocate the items based on the highest valuation.

3. **Assign Items**:
   - **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it higher (27 vs. 2) → Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
   - **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it higher (65 vs. 64) → Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it higher (93 vs. 63) → Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 1.
   - Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2.

5. **Format the Allocation**:
   - Since there are only 2 agents, they can be represented as keys "0" and "1" in the JSON format.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
