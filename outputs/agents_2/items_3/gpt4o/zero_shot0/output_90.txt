Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2
0  93  35  72
1  77  90  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuation table provided and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction for each agent. Given the table:

```
    0   1   2
0  93  35  72
1  77  90  75
```

We have two agents (0 and 1) and three items (0, 1, and 2). Each agent should receive an integer number of items, and ideally, we should try to distribute the items such that each agent's total value is maximized.

Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 93
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 72

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 77
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 75

Looking at the values, we can make the following observations:

1. Agent 0 highly values Item 0 (93) and Item 2 (72).
2. Agent 1 values Item 1 the most (90) and also values Item 2 (75) nearly equally.

To fairly allocate and maximize satisfaction, let's proceed with the following allocation:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 since they value it the most.
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 since they value it the most.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.

This gives us the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 1.

Now, let's represent the allocations in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' valuations, maximizing the total value for each agent.
