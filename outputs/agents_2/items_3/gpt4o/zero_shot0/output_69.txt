Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2
0  99  20  79
1  35  94  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items based on the given valuations, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 99 (item 0) + 20 (item 1) + 79 (item 2) = 198
   - Agent 1: 35 (item 0) + 94 (item 1) + 16 (item 2) = 145

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 at 35. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 94, Agent 0 at 20. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 at 16. Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
   - Agent 1 gets item 1.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
