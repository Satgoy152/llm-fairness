Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2
0  37  89  39
1  17  44  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17 44 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we have to consider their valuations and try to maximize the fairness of the distribution. In this scenario, we have two agents and three items with different valuations. Below is one way to allocate the items:

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 37
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 39

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 17
  - Item 1: 44
  - Item 2: 33

### Allocation Strategy:
Let's consider maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive:

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest at 89.
   
2. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 has a higher valuation for Item 2 (33) compared to Item 0 (17).

3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0:**
   - With Agent 0 receiving Item 1, allocating Item 0 increases their total valuation.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 126 (37 + 89) and Agent 1 a total valuation of 33, which is the best allocation considering the given valuations.
