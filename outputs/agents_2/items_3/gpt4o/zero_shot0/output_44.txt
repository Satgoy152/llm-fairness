Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2
0  23  28  91
1  99  48  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 48 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuations each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the table of valuations:

```
       Items
        0   1   2
Agents
0      23  28  91
1      99  48  18
```

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 23, Item 1 = 28, Item 2 = 91
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 99, Item 1 = 48, Item 2 = 18

Given that there are only 3 items and 2 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the other agent will receive 1 item.

To maximize fairness, we can look at the highest value each agent places on the items:

1. Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (91).
2. Agent 1 values Item 0 the most (99).

By assigning Item 0 to Agent 1 and Item 2 to Agent 0, we can then decide on Item 1, which is valued at 28 by Agent 0 and 48 by Agent 1. To balance the total value, we assign Item 1 to Agent 1, who values it more.

So, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
