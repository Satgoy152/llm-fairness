Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2
0  30  20  25
1  90  21  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are two agents and three items, one possible fair allocation is to maximize the value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. 

Let's analyze the given values:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 30
- Item 1: 20
- Item 2: 25

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 90
- Item 1: 21
- Item 2: 25

One possible allocation that maximizes the overall value for each agent could be:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it the highest at 90.
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 1.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it slightly higher than Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is as fair as possible based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
