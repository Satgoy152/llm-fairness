Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2
0  82  79  47
1  41   0  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 82
- Item 1: 79
- Item 2: 47

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 41
- Item 1: 0
- Item 2: 96

To maximize the satisfaction, we'll assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 82, Agent 1 values it at 41. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 values it at 0. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 values it at 96. Assign to Agent 1.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
