Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2
0  93  54  26
1  53  40  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations. Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 93
- Item 1: 54
- Item 2: 26

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 53
- Item 1: 40
- Item 2: 54

To achieve a fair allocation, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. One common approach is to use a method like the "maximum sum of valuations" or a "greedy" allocation based on the highest valuation per item.

Let's proceed with allocating the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 93
   - Agent 1 values it at 53
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 54
   - Agent 1 values it at 40
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation)

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 26
   - Agent 1 values it at 54
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation)

Based on the above allocation, each agent receives the following items:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Item 2

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
