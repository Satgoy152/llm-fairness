Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2
0  53  69  29
1  36  70  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's break down the task based on the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 53
- Item 1: 69
- Item 2: 29

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 36
- Item 1: 70
- Item 2: 79

We want to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's analyze each item:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 53, and Agent 1 values it at 36.  
   Thus, Item 0 should be allocated to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 69, and Agent 1 values it at 70.  
   Thus, Item 1 should be allocated to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 29, and Agent 1 values it at 79.  
   Thus, Item 2 should be allocated to Agent 1.

Based on this analysis, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.

Now, we'll present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
