Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2
0  88  70   5
1  45  21  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 21 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we need to ensure that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 88
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 2: 5

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 45
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 43

Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive for different allocations to seek a fair distribution:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 and Item 1 and Item 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0: 88 (Item 0)
   - Agent 1: 21 + 43 = 64 (Items 1 and 2)

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 and Item 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0: 70 (Item 1)
   - Agent 1: 45 + 43 = 88 (Items 0 and 2)

3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 and Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0: 5 (Item 2)
   - Agent 1: 45 + 21 = 66 (Items 0 and 1)

Based on these calculations, the allocation with the closest value distribution is option 1:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0
- Allocate Item 1 and Item 2 to Agent 1

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
