Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2
0  55  29   2
1  38  42  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive. Let's evaluate the given values:

```
Agent 0:
- Item 0: 55
- Item 1: 29
- Item 2: 2

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 38
- Item 1: 42
- Item 2: 81
```

To find a fair allocation, we can use a simple method like maximizing the total value for each agent by selecting items based on their preferences.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Choose Item 0 (value 55) and Item 1 (value 29). These provide Agent 0 with the highest total value (55 + 29 = 84).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Choose Item 2 (value 81). This provides Agent 1 with the highest possible value for a single item.

This allocation leaves each agent with a fair share based on their preferences:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.

Now, to present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```
