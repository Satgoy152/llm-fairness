Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2
0  55  69  45
1   4  52  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. Here's how we can approach the allocation:

1. **Valuations Table:**

   | Agent/Item | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
   |------------|--------|--------|--------|
   | Agent 0    | 55     | 69     | 45     |
   | Agent 1    | 4      | 52     | 95     |

2. **Optimal Allocation Strategy:**

   - Agent 0 values Item 1 the most (69), followed by Item 0 (55), then Item 2 (45).
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 the most (95), followed by Item 1 (52), then Item 0 (4).

3. **Allocate Items:**

   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 because they value it the most (95), much higher than Agent 0 (45).
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 because they value it slightly more (69) than Agent 1 (52).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 because they value it significantly more (55) than Agent 1 (4).

4. **Final Allocation:**

   - Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 1.
   - Agent 1 gets Item 2.

5. **JSON Representation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations of the items, ensuring a fair and efficient distribution.
