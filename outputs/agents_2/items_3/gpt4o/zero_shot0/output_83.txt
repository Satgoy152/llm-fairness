Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2
0  66  95  99
1  65   6  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will use a simple approach to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. In this case, we have two agents and three items. We aim to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2
0  66  95  99
1  65   6  16
```

Let's evaluate the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: 66, 95, 99
   - Total value if given all items: 66 + 95 + 99 = 260

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: 65, 6, 16
   - Total value if given all items: 65 + 6 + 16 = 87

To maximize the allocation, we should prioritize the items that have the highest individual value for each agent. In this case, Agent 0 has higher valuations across the board compared to Agent 1.

Since we only have two agents and three items, a straightforward allocation is to give two items to the agent with higher overall valuations (Agent 0) and one item to the other agent (Agent 1). Here's a potential allocation:

- Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

This allocation is based on maximizing the total value for Agent 0 while ensuring Agent 1 gets at least one item.

Let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and attempts to fairly distribute based on the given valuations.
