Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2
0  79  18  99
1  70  77  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can use a simple procedure to ensure that the distribution is as fair as possible based on the agents' valuations. Given the valuations of 2 agents for 3 items, we can analyze and allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction.

Here's the valuation table:

```
Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2
-----------|----|----|---
Agent 0    | 79 | 18 | 99
Agent 1    | 70 | 77 | 63
```

To allocate the items fairly, we can use a strategy similar to a "greedy algorithm" where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 79 and Agent 1 values it at 70. Therefore, allocate **Item 0** to **Agent 0**.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 18 and Agent 1 values it at 77. Therefore, allocate **Item 1** to **Agent 1**.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 99 and Agent 1 values it at 63. Therefore, allocate **Item 2** to **Agent 0**.

Thus, the allocation based on the highest valuations would be:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 2]
- Agent 1 receives item [1]

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation based on their preferences.
