Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2
0  33  85  21
1  44  92  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple method where we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one way to do it:

1. **Analyze the Valuation Matrix:**

    |     | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 |
    |-----|--------|--------|--------|
    | Agent 0 | 33     | 85     | 21     |
    | Agent 1 | 44     | 92     | 57     |

2. **Consider the Total Valuation:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 33 + 85 + 21 = 139
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 44 + 92 + 57 = 193

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, given there are only 3 items, one simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest individual valuations.

4. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Step 1:** Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it the most (92).
   - **Step 2:** Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 also has a higher valuation for it (44 vs. 33).
   - **Step 3:** Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 because that is the remaining item.
   
   This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items.

5. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, with Agent 1 receiving two items they value highly and Agent 0 receiving the remaining item.
