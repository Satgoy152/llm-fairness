Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2
0  31  13  40
1  19  52  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can follow a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent. In this scenario, we have two agents and three items, and we want each agent to receive at least one item.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 40

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 52
  - Item 2: 74

To maximize fairness, we should aim to allocate items so that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible. The simplest approach is to allocate the highest valued items to each agent:

1. **Agent 1** values Item 2 the most (74). Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values Item 0 the most (31). Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
3. The remaining item is Item 1. Agent 1 values Item 1 higher (52) than Agent 0 (13). Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

Thus, the final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
