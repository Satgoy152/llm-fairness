Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2
0  16  36  48
1  13  45  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents based on their valuations, we should aim for an allocation that maximizes the total value for each agent. We must also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since we have two agents (0 and 1) and three items (0, 1, 2), let's analyze and allocate the items:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 16
- Item 1: 36
- Item 2: 48

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 13
- Item 1: 45
- Item 2: 61

To ensure a fair distribution, we should consider the total valuation each agent places on each possible allocation and try to maximize the overall satisfaction.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 2** has the highest valuation for both agents, but Agent 1 values it more (61 compared to 48). Therefore, we allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item at 45, whereas Agent 0 values it at 36. Agent 1 has already received Item 2, so to balance the allocation, we assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 0**: Finally, Agent 0 values this item at 16, and Agent 1 values it at 13. Since Agent 0 has only received one item so far, we allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive an integer number of items and the distribution is fair based on their valuations.

### JSON Representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
