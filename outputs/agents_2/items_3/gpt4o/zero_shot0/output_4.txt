Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2
0  57  21  14
1  94  10  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [94 10 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each receives an integer number of items. Given the values:

```
Agent 0:
  Item 0: 57
  Item 1: 21
  Item 2: 14

Agent 1:
  Item 0: 94
  Item 1: 10
  Item 2: 94
```

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Allocate Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 57.
   - Agent 1 values it at 94.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

2. **Allocate Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 21.
   - Agent 1 values it at 10.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

3. **Allocate Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 14.
   - Agent 1 values it at 94.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

The final allocation would be:
- Agent 0 gets Item 1.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2.

Presented in the requested JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
