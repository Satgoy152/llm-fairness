Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2
0  92  89  89
1  40  39   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 89 89]
 [40 39  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 values all items equally at high values (92, 89, 89), they should receive the items that maximize their total valuation.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has lower valuations for the items, with the highest being 40 and 39. 

Given these observations, let's allocate the items as follows:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for item 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it at 0, and Agent 0 has already been allocated two items).

The resulting allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and Agent 0 receives the items that they value the most.
