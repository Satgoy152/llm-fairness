Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2
0  61  92  88
1  37  74  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the table:

```
    0   1   2
0  61  92  88
1  37  74  28
```

We have two agents and three items. We need to distribute these items in a way that maximizes each agent's perceived value. The values assigned to each item by each agent are:

- Agent 0 values: [61, 92, 88]
- Agent 1 values: [37, 74, 28]

To determine a fair allocation, we can use a simple approach by comparing the values and allocating items to the agent who values them more.

1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 61, and Agent 1 values it at 37. So, assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 92, and Agent 1 values it at 74. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 88, and Agent 1 values it at 28. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

Based on this, the allocation can be:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives no items in this scenario, which indicates an imbalance.

To ensure fairness, we can reconsider the allocation to allow Agent 1 to receive at least one item if possible while maintaining the highest total valuation for both agents.

Let's make a balanced allocation:

1. **Item 0:** Assign to Agent 0 (higher value).
2. **Item 1:** Assign to Agent 1 to ensure they receive at least one item.
3. **Item 2:** Assign to Agent 0 (higher value).

Thus, the adjusted allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 1: Item 1

Now, we format this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This solution ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and aims to maximize the total perceived value for each agent while providing a basic form of fairness.
