Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2
0  11  97  90
1  79  41  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[11 97 90]
 [79 41 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, considering their respective preferences. Let's analyze the given valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2
0  11  97  90
1  79  41  53
```

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (97), followed by item 2 (90), and then item 0 (11).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (79), followed by item 2 (53), and then item 1 (41).

Based on this, we can use a simple allocation method:

1. Allocate item 1 to agent 0 because it is their highest-valued item.
2. Allocate item 0 to agent 1 because it is their highest-valued item.
3. Allocate item 2 to agent 0 because it is their second highest-valued item, and it does not conflict with agent 1's highest-valued item.

This allocation results in the following distribution:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
