Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2
0  81  55  18
1  16  12  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total satisfaction of both agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2
0  81  55  18
1  16  12  98
```

Let's analyze:

- Agent 0 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 81
  - Item 1: 55
  - Item 2: 18

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 16
  - Item 1: 12
  - Item 2: 98

The goal is to allocate the items to maximize the perceived value for each agent. A straightforward allocation could consider giving each agent the items they value the most.

### Allocation:
1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values Item 0 the highest (81).
   - Values Item 1 the second highest (55).
   - Therefore, allocate Items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values Item 2 the highest (98).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive the items they value the most.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items they value the most (0 and 1), and Agent 1 receives the item they value the most (2). Each agent receives a different number of items, but this allocation maximizes overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
