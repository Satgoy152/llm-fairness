Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

        0   1   2
0  69  43  63
1  84  93  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives items in a way that reflects their preferences. 

Given the valuations:

```
    Item
       0   1   2
    0  69  43  63   (Agent 0)
    1  84  93  48   (Agent 1)
```

We can analyze the total value of each item and the preference of each agent for each item. Since we want a fair allocation, we can consider a method that maximizes the total satisfaction of the agents.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: 69 (Agent 0) + 84 (Agent 1) = 153
   - Item 1: 43 (Agent 0) + 93 (Agent 1) = 136
   - Item 2: 63 (Agent 0) + 48 (Agent 1) = 111

2. **Sort Items by Total Value:**
   - Item 0: 153
   - Item 1: 136
   - Item 2: 111

3. **Allocate the Items:**
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest total value).
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (next highest total value).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

### Proposed Allocations:
- Agent 0 receives Item 2.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1.

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed while considering the valuations of both agents. Each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocations reflect their preferences.
