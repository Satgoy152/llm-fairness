Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

        0   1   2
0  45  83  19
1   3  45  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider the preferences of each agent for each item. The given valuations are:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 45
  - Item 1: 83
  - Item 2: 19

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 3
  - Item 1: 45
  - Item 2: 75

### Step 1: Analyze the Valuations
From the valuations, we can see the preferences:
- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest, followed by item 1.

### Step 2: Allocation Strategy
We will try to allocate items based on the highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. 

### Allocation Process
1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valued item (83).
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item (75).
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 as well, since Agent 0 has already received their preferred item.

### Final Allocation
- Agent 0 receives: [1]
- Agent 1 receives: [0, 2]

### JSON Format
We need to represent the allocations in the specified JSON format. Since there are only two agents, we will represent the allocations accordingly.

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

### Final Allocations
Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
