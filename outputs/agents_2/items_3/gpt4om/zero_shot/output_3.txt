Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

        0   1   2
0  76  46   4
1  53  18  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple approach. We need to ensure that each agent receives items in such a way that their total value is maximized while also keeping the allocation fair. 

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 76
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 4
  
- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 53
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 64

### Steps for Allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valued item for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 prefers Item 0 (76).
   - Agent 1 prefers Item 2 (64).

2. **Allocate items based on preferences:**
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
   - The remaining item (Item 1) can be allocated to either agent. 

3. **Fair allocation of remaining item:**
   - Since both agents will end up with one item each, we can allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, resulting in:
     - Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
     - Agent 1: Item 2

### Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2]
}
```

Here, Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, while Agent 1 receives item 2. This allocation is fair and maximizes the total value for each agent.
