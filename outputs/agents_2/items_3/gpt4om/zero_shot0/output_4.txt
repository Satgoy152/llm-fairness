Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

        0   1   2
0  48  40  97
1  22   5   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will consider the valuations given in the table for each item by each agent. The goal is to maximize the total utility for all agents while ensuring that they all receive an integer number of items.

Given the table:

```
        0   1   2
0  48  40  97
1  22   5   5
```

We have:

- Agent 0 values item 0 at 48, item 1 at 40, and item 2 at 97.
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 22, item 1 at 5, and item 2 at 5.

One way to approach this problem is to allocate the items based on the highest total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's assume the following allocation strategy:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 since it has the highest value for that item (97).
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 next as it also has a high value (48).
3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 since it has the next highest value (5).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2 (total value: 48 + 97 = 145).
- Agent 1 receives item 1 (total value: 5).

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```

In summary, the final allocations are:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.

Hereâ€™s the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": []
}
```
