Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

        0   1   2
0  17  45  58
1   5  83  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider how to distribute the items (0, 1, 2) to agents (0, 1) based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
      0   1   2
0  17  45  58
1   5  83  33
```

- Agent 0 values item 0 at 17, item 1 at 45, and item 2 at 58.
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 5, item 1 at 83, and item 2 at 33.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Evaluate total values**:
   - Total value for Agent 0: 17 + 45 + 58 = 120
   - Total value for Agent 1: 5 + 83 + 33 = 121

2. **Fair distribution**:
   - We will aim to allocate the items such that both agents feel fairly treated based on their valuations.

### Possible Allocation
We can allocate the items as follows:
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, item 1 to Agent 1, and item 2 to Agent 1.

This gives:
- Agent 0 receives item 0 (value = 17)
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2 (values = 83 + 33 = 116)

### Valuation Comparison
- Agent 0's total value: 17
- Agent 1's total value: 116

This allocation is not fair as Agent 1 receives a much higher total value.

### Adjusted Allocation
Instead, let's try:
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1, item 1 to Agent 0, and item 2 to Agent 0.

This gives:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2 (values = 45 + 58 = 103)
- Agent 1 receives item 0 (value = 5)

Now, we can try to balance it better. Ultimately, let's try:
- Agent 0 receives item 2
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.

This gives:
- Agent 0: 58 (item 2)
- Agent 1: 5 + 83 = 88 (items 0 and 1)

### Final Allocation
After trying different combinations, one fair allocation can be:
- Agent 0 gets item 1 and item 2
- Agent 1 gets item 0

This gives:
- Agent 0: 45 + 58 = 103
- Agent 1: 5

This is still not balanced. 

Instead, the final fair allocation could be:
- Agent 0 receives item 2
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.

This gives:
- Agent 0: 58
- Agent 1: 5 + 83 = 88.

To summarize, the fair allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
``` 

### Final Allocations
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0]
}
```
