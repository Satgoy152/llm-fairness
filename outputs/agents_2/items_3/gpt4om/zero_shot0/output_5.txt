Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

        0   1   2
0  32  11  13
1  79  70  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can start by determining the total value each agent assigns to each item and then allocate items in a way that aims to maximize the value for each agent while ensuring that the allocations are fair.

Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2
0  32  11  13
1  79  70  79
```

We can summarize the process as follows:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: 
   - Agent 0 values the items as follows:
     - Item 0: 32
     - Item 1: 11
     - Item 2: 13
   - Agent 1 values the items as follows:
     - Item 0: 79
     - Item 1: 70
     - Item 2: 79

2. **Total Value for Each Item**: 
   - Item 0 total value: 32 + 79 = 111
   - Item 1 total value: 11 + 70 = 81
   - Item 2 total value: 13 + 79 = 92

3. **Prioritize Allocation Based on Value**: 
   - We can allocate items based on the highest total value while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. 

4. **Fair Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 1 (highest value for agent 1).
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 0 (agent 0 has a higher value for this item compared to agent 1).
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1 (agent 1 has a higher value).

After the allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

5. **Final Allocation**:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and they are distributed based on the valuation provided.
