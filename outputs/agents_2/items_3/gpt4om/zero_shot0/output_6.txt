Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

        0   1   2
0  93   1  27
1  62  48  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider the preferences of each agent for each item and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation considering the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0** values items as follows:
   - Item 0: 93
   - Item 1: 1
   - Item 2: 27

2. **Agent 1** values items as follows:
   - Item 0: 62
   - Item 1: 48
   - Item 2: 12

### Allocation Strategy
We can allocate the items based on the highest value for each agent:

- **Agent 0** should receive Item 0 since it has the highest value (93).
- **Agent 0** can also be allocated Item 2 since it has the next highest value (27).
- **Agent 1** will then receive Item 1 as it is the only item left.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and takes into account their highest valuations.

### Final Allocation
Based on our allocation strategy, the final allocation looks like this:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": []
}
```

This means:
- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets no items.

This allocation is fair based on the valuations provided.
