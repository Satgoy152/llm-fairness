Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

        0   1  2
0  23  92  8
1  55  24  8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items based on the valuations of the agents, we can approach this problem by trying to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. 

Given the valuations:

```
    0   1  2
0  23  92  8
1  55  24  8
```

- For Agent 0:
  - Item 0: Value = 23
  - Item 1: Value = 92
  - Item 2: Value = 8

- For Agent 1:
  - Item 0: Value = 55
  - Item 1: Value = 24
  - Item 2: Value = 8

To allocate the items, we can consider the total value each agent would get from receiving specific items while trying to keep the allocations fair. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 or Agent 1, as both agents have the same value for this item.

We can try the following allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.

This gives us the following allocations based on the values:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 2].
- Agent 1 receives item [0].

To represent this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": []
}
```

Thus, the final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": []
}
```
