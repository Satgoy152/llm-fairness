Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

        0   1   2
0  55  36  14
1  65  55  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can consider the values each agent has for each item and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

```
        0   1   2
0  55  36  14  (Agent 0)
1  65  55  44  (Agent 1)
```

We have a total of 3 items and 2 agents. A fair allocation might involve giving each agent items based on their highest valuations.

A possible allocation could be:
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it (65).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it (36).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it (44).

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

Now, we can represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This means Agent 0 receives item 1, and Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2. Each agent receives an integer number of items, and we have fairly considered their valuations.
