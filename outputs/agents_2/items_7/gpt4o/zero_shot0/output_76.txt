Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  34  21  49  22  27  93
1  11  52  94  77   8  44  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. One common approach to achieve this is to use the "Envy-Free" method, though it may not always be perfectly possible with integer allocations. Here, we'll try to allocate the items by maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

First, let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [65, 34, 21, 49, 22, 27, 93]
- Agent 1: [11, 52, 94, 77, 8, 44, 63]

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it higher (65 vs. 11).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it higher (52 vs. 34).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it significantly higher (94 vs. 21).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it higher (77 vs. 49).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it higher (22 vs. 8).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it higher (44 vs. 27).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it higher (93 vs. 63).

Here's one way to fairly allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets items with higher valuation for them: 0, 4, 6.
- Agent 1 gets items with higher valuation for them: 1, 2, 3, 5.

Now, the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the total valuation each agent receives based on their individual preferences.
