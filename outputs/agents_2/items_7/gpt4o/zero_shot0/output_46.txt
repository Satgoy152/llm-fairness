Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26   3  54  43  60  42  27
1  83  60  62  65  48  47  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value. One common method is to aim for an allocation where the total value of items each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

First, let's calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 26 + 3 + 54 + 43 + 60 + 42 + 27 = 255
- Agent 1: 83 + 60 + 62 + 65 + 48 + 47 + 96 = 461

The goal is to allocate items to each agent such that the value each agent receives is as close as possible to half of the combined total value.

Combined total value = 255 + 461 = 716
Half of the combined total value = 716 / 2 = 358

Next, let's allocate the items:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued items to the agent that values them the most until their total value is close to 358.
2. Balance the remaining items between the agents to achieve fairness.

After considering the above steps, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 (total value 255): Allocate items to get as close to 358.
- Agent 1 (total value 461): Allocate items to get as close to 358.

Let's allocate:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 3, 5] (Values: 26, 3, 43, 42 = 114)
- Agent 1: [2, 4, 6] (Values: 62, 60, 96 = 218)

Re-evaluate to balance better by swapping items if necessary:

- Swap item 3 from agent 0 to agent 1 and item 2 from agent 1 to agent 0 to better balance.

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 2, 5] (Values: 26, 3, 54, 42 = 125)
- Agent 1: [3, 4, 6] (Values: 65, 48, 96 = 209)

This allocation is close to fair based on the given valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
