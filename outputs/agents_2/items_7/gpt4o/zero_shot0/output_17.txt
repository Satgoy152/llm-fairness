Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  71  39  57  35  65  51
1   8  59  68   4  91  88  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple optimization approach to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's consider the possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would have for all items.
2. Try to balance the total value each agent receives by assigning items that have high value for one agent but lower value for the other, whenever possible.
3. Ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has higher value for items 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6 compared to Agent 1.
- Agent 1 has higher value for items 2 and 4 compared to Agent 0.

Based on this, we can allocate items as follows:

- Agent 0 will receive items 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6.
- Agent 1 will receive items 2 and 4.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
