Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  31  86  63  62  31  79
1   4  16  51  84   1   7  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 4 16 51 84  1  7 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. We'll try to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [75, 31, 86, 63, 62, 31, 79]
- Agent 1's valuations: [4, 16, 51, 84, 1, 7, 30]

We can use a greedy algorithm to allocate items based on where the largest disparity exists (i.e., where one agent values an item much more than the other).

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it significantly higher (75 vs. 4).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it higher (31 vs. 16).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it higher (86 vs. 51).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it higher (84 vs. 63).
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it higher (62 vs. 1).
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it higher (31 vs. 7).
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it higher (79 vs. 30).

From this, we can suggest an allocation that balances the total value as best as possible:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5
- Agent 1 gets items: 3, 6

Now, let's evaluate the total value for each agent:
- Agent 0's total value: 75 + 31 + 86 + 62 + 31 = 285
- Agent 1's total value: 84 + 30 = 114

This allocation attempts to balance the value, but due to the disparity in individual item valuations, agent 0 will naturally have a higher total value.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
