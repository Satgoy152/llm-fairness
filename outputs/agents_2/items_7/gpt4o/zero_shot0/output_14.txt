Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  96  39  22  88  96  61
1  90   7   4  88  44  59  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we can try to distribute the items to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent.

Let's evaluate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [25, 96, 39, 22, 88, 96, 61]
- Agent 1's valuations: [90, 7, 4, 88, 44, 59, 96]

We can try to allocate items to agents based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. Item 1 (96) is highly valued by both agents, but Agent 0 values it more (96) compared to Agent 1 (7).
2. Item 0 (25) is more valuable to Agent 1 (90) than to Agent 0 (25).
3. Item 2 has a low valuation for both agents but is slightly higher for Agent 0 (39) than for Agent 1 (4).
4. Item 3 and Item 4 have higher overall valuations for Agent 1.
5. Item 5 is highly valued by both agents, but Agent 0 values it more (96) compared to Agent 1 (59).
6. Item 6 is highly valued by Agent 1 (96) and less by Agent 0 (61).

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 2, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 3, 4, 6

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
