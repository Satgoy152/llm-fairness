Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  77  64  94  36  33  93
1  42  17  50  81  27  43  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where items are given to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations and allocate items accordingly:

1. For item 0, agent 0 values it at 29 and agent 1 at 42. Allocate to agent 1.
2. For item 1, agent 0 values it at 77 and agent 1 at 17. Allocate to agent 0.
3. For item 2, agent 0 values it at 64 and agent 1 at 50. Allocate to agent 0.
4. For item 3, agent 0 values it at 94 and agent 1 at 81. Allocate to agent 0.
5. For item 4, agent 0 values it at 36 and agent 1 at 27. Allocate to agent 0.
6. For item 5, agent 0 values it at 33 and agent 1 at 43. Allocate to agent 1.
7. For item 6, agent 0 values it at 93 and agent 1 at 59. Allocate to agent 0.

After allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 5

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 5]
}
```
