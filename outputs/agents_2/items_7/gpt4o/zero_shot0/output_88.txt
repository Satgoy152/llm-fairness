Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  38  88  24  81  68   3
1  44   5  29  17  89  99  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44  5 29 17 89 99 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would get if they received each item.
2. Allocate items to agents such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 4, 6
  - Total valuation: 94 + 88 + 81 + 3 = 266
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 5
  - Total valuation: 5 + 17 + 99 = 121

This allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
