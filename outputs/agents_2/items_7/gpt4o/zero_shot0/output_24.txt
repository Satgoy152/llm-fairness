Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  58  17  17  87  61  40
1  76  69  34  41  67  58  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim for a distribution where each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items. Given there are 7 items and 2 agents, one way to approach this is to use a method like maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent's allocated items, ensuring each agent gets either 3 or 4 items.

Let's calculate a fair allocation by maximizing the total value for each agent:

1. List all item values for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values: [57, 58, 17, 17, 87, 61, 40]
   - Agent 1 values: [76, 69, 34, 41, 67, 58, 84]

2. Sort items by value for each agent:
   - Agent 0 sorted: [(4, 87), (1, 58), (5, 61), (0, 57), (6, 40), (2, 17), (3, 17)]
   - Agent 1 sorted: [(0, 76), (6, 84), (1, 69), (4, 67), (5, 58), (3, 41), (2, 34)]

3. We can start allocating items by alternating between the agents to ensure fairness, taking the highest valued available item for each agent.

4. Let's allocate the items:
   - Agent 0 gets items: [4, 1, 5] (values: 87, 58, 61)
   - Agent 1 gets items: [0, 6, 2, 3] (values: 76, 84, 34, 41)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the items and maximizes their individual total valuations as much as possible.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 5],
    "1": [0, 6, 2, 3]
}
```
