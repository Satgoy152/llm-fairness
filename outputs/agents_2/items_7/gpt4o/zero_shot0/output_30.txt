Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  57   7  71  42  99  49
1  28  85  22  25  51  76  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 57  7 71 42 99 49]
 [28 85 22 25 51 76 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuation difference between the two agents.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
Agent 0's valuations: [96, 57, 7, 71, 42, 99, 49]
Agent 1's valuations: [28, 85, 22, 25, 51, 76, 53]
```

To decide which agent should get each item, we calculate the difference in valuations for each item and assign the item to the agent who values it more:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 values it at 28. Difference: 68 (allocated to Agent 0)
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 values it at 85. Difference: 28 (allocated to Agent 1)
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 7, Agent 1 values it at 22. Difference: 15 (allocated to Agent 1)
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 values it at 25. Difference: 46 (allocated to Agent 0)
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 values it at 51. Difference: 9 (allocated to Agent 1)
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 values it at 76. Difference: 23 (allocated to Agent 0)
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 values it at 53. Difference: 4 (allocated to Agent 1)

After assigning items based on the highest valuation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 4, 6

Now, let's structure these allocations into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
