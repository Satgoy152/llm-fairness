Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  81  64   7  27  54  38
1  44  70   8  73  32  40  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will evaluate the valuations and attempt a balanced distribution based on the given values.

First, let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 21, 81, 64, 7, 27, 54, 38
- Agent 1's total valuation: 44, 70, 8, 73, 32, 40, 15

A strategy is to assign items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction and ensuring a reasonable balance in the total valuation between the two agents.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High valuation items: 1 (81), 2 (64), 5 (54)
   - Total value: 81 + 64 + 54 = 199

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuation items: 3 (73), 0 (44), 4 (32), 6 (15)
   - Total value: 73 + 44 + 32 + 15 = 164

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

**Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive while ensuring a fair distribution based on their valuations.
