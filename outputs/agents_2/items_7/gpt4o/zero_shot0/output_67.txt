Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  67  90  90   8  25   6
1  62  17  96  18  74  18  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent. One approach is to assign items to agents such that the total value for each agent is maximized, while also ensuring that each agent receives a roughly equal number of items.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for each item.
2. Start by assigning the item to the agent who values it more.
3. If an agent's allocation exceeds the other agent's by more than one item, attempt to reallocate the least valued item from the agent with more items.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Assign items with a higher value to each agent.
- Allocate items to ensure each agent receives a balanced number of items.

Based on the values provided, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 5, while Agent 1 receives items 3, 4, and 6. This allocation aims to balance the number of items and maximize the value for each agent based on their preferences.
