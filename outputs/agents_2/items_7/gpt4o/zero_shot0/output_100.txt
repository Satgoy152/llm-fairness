Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  32  66  47  87   5  36
1  69  12   6  54  61  32   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent based on their valuations of the items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where each agent selects the item that provides the highest remaining value, one at a time, until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **List all items with their valuations for each agent:**

   | Item | Agent 0 Valuation | Agent 1 Valuation |
   |------|-------------------|-------------------|
   | 0    | 58                | 69                |
   | 1    | 32                | 12                |
   | 2    | 66                |  6                |
   | 3    | 47                | 54                |
   | 4    | 87                | 61                |
   | 5    |  5                | 32                |
   | 6    | 36                |  1                |

2. **Determine the preference of each agent for each item based on their valuations.** 
   - Agent 0: [4, 2, 0, 3, 6, 1, 5]
   - Agent 1: [0, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 6]

3. **Allocate items to each agent based on their preference and availability:**

   - Agent 1 selects item 0 (highest value 69).
   - Agent 0 selects item 4 (highest value 87).
   - Agent 0 selects item 2 (next highest value 66).
   - Agent 1 selects item 3 (next highest value 54).
   - Agent 1 selects item 5 (next highest value 32).
   - Agent 0 selects item 6 (next highest value 36).
   - Agent 0 selects item 1 (next highest value 32).

4. **Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 6, 1],
    "1": [0, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items while attempting to maximize their total valuation based on the given preferences.
