Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  99  65  77   3  43  86
1   5  75  26  48  19   6  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a method like the "round-robin" allocation or to maximize the sum of values for each agent while ensuring fairness.

Let's consider the valuations provided:

- Agent 0's valuations: [28, 99, 65, 77, 3, 43, 86]
- Agent 1's valuations: [5, 75, 26, 48, 19, 6, 33]

The goal is to allocate the items to maximize the perceived fairness or utility. We can adopt a greedy strategy where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with an equal number of items, given there are 7 items.

However, since there are only 7 items and 2 agents, a completely equal distribution isn't possible. Instead, we will aim to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Compare the valuations for each item and allocate it to the agent with the higher valuation.
2. Adjust if necessary to ensure a balanced distribution.

### Allocation Process:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it 28 vs. Agent 1 values it 5. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it 99 vs. Agent 1 values it 75. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it 65 vs. Agent 1 values it 26. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it 77 vs. Agent 1 values it 48. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it 3 vs. Agent 1 values it 19. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it 43 vs. Agent 1 values it 6. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it 86 vs. Agent 1 values it 33. Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation leaves Agent 1 without a fair share. We need to adjust:

Re-evaluate to ensure fairness:

1. Transfer some items from Agent 0 to Agent 1 to balance:
   - Move Item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 48, which is a reasonable value compared to other items).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation provides a fair distribution based on the initial high-valued allocation and subsequent adjustments to improve fairness.
