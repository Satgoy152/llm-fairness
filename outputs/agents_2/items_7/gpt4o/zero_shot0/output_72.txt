Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  51  14  96  95   8  47
1  60  49   2   0   5  78   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent and attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use a method such as the "Max-Min Fairness" or "Envy-Free" allocation, but given the simplicity of the problem, we'll aim for a straightforward allocation that balances value as evenly as possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Distribute items to balance the total value each agent receives.

Calculating total values:
- Agent 0: 75 + 51 + 14 + 96 + 95 + 8 + 47 = 386
- Agent 1: 60 + 49 + 2 + 0 + 5 + 78 + 7 = 201

To balance the allocation, we can try the following approach:

1. Assign items with high value from agent 0 to agent 0.
2. Assign items with high value from agent 1 to agent 1.
3. Balance remaining items to equalize total value as much as possible.

Using this strategy:

Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 4, 6 (high value for agent 0)
- Total value: 75 + 96 + 95 + 47 = 313

Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 5 (high value for agent 1 and balancing)
- Total value: 49 + 2 + 78 = 129

This allocation provides a relatively balanced distribution of total value based on the agents' own valuations.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
