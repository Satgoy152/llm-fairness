Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  63  53  51  17  38   4
1  36  61  59  58  56  96  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 63 53 51 17 38  4]
 [36 61 59 58 56 96 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the following strategy: aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a similar number of items. Given that there are 7 items, one agent will get 4 items and the other will get 3 items.

Let's go through the valuations:

Agent 0: [89, 63, 53, 51, 17, 38, 4]
Agent 1: [36, 61, 59, 58, 56, 96, 70]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Identify the items with the highest total value for both agents.
2. Allocate items with the highest individual valuations to each agent in a way that balances the total value received by each agent.

#### Step-by-step Allocation:
- Item 0: Highest value for Agent 0 (89 vs. 36)
- Item 5: Highest value for Agent 1 (96 vs. 38)
- Item 6: Highest value for Agent 1 (70 vs. 4)
- Item 1: Higher value for Agent 0 (63 vs. 61)
- Item 2: Higher value for Agent 1 (59 vs. 53)
- Item 3: Higher value for Agent 1 (58 vs. 51)
- Item 4: Higher value for Agent 1 (56 vs. 17)

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 3, 5, and 6.

This allocation provides a fair distribution based on the given valuations.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
