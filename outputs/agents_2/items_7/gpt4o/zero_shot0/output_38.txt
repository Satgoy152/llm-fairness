Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  56   3  67  61   1  95
1  82   8  76  28  83  50  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to each agent to balance their total valuation as much as possible.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 51 + 56 + 3 + 67 + 61 + 1 + 95 = 334
- Agent 1's total valuation: 82 + 8 + 76 + 28 + 83 + 50 + 24 = 351

Next, we aim to distribute the items to balance the valuations. A common approach is to try to alternate giving high-value items to each agent to balance their total valuations. Let's allocate:

1. Allocate the highest value item (index 6, value 95) to Agent 0.
2. Allocate the next highest value item (index 4, value 83) to Agent 1.
3. Allocate the next highest value item (index 0, value 82) to Agent 1.
4. Allocate the next highest value item (index 3, value 67) to Agent 0.
5. Allocate the next highest value item (index 2, value 76) to Agent 1.
6. Allocate the next highest value item (index 1, value 56) to Agent 0.
7. Allocate the last item (index 5, value 50) to Agent 1.

The allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 3, and 1
- Agent 1: Items 4, 0, 2, and 5

The JSON format for the allocations is:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3, 1],
    "1": [4, 0, 2, 5]
}
```
