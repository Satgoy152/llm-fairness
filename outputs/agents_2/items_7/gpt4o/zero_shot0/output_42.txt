Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74   2  25  40  70  13  27
1  65  99  49  16  69  96  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction for both agents or balances the perceived value they receive.

Given the valuations, let's try to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0's total valuation for all items is: 74 + 2 + 25 + 40 + 70 + 13 + 27 = 251
2. Agent 1's total valuation for all items is: 65 + 99 + 49 + 16 + 69 + 96 + 80 = 474

We aim to balance the total value each agent perceives. Here is one potential allocation:

- Allocate high-value items for each agent to balance the perceived total value.
  
**Allocation:**
- Agent 0: [0, 2, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: [1, 4, 6]

**Explanation:**
- Agent 0 values items 0, 2, 3, 5 as follows: 74, 25, 40, 13. Total value = 152
- Agent 1 values items 1, 4, 6 as follows: 99, 69, 80. Total value = 248

This allocation gives each agent a set of items they value highly while keeping a fair distribution in terms of perceived value.

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6]
}
```
