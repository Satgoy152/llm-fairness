Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  43  20  42  90  38  45
1  71  65  98  51  19  38  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's start by considering the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 42 + 43 + 20 + 42 + 90 + 38 + 45 = 280
- Agent 1's total valuation: 71 + 65 + 98 + 51 + 19 + 38 + 51 = 393

Next, we will attempt to allocate items to balance the perceived value each agent receives. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Allocate items based on the highest relative value for each agent.
2. Ensure each agent receives an approximately equal number of items.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 highly (90), so we assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 highly (98), so we assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. For the remaining items, we'll give priority based on each agent's relative valuation:

   - Item 0: Agent 1 (71) > Agent 0 (42) -> Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (65) > Agent 0 (43) -> Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (42) > Agent 1 (51) -> Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 5: Both have the same value (38), prioritize balancing the number of items -> Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (51) > Agent 0 (45) -> Assign to Agent 1

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 3, 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 0, 1, 6

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 0, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
