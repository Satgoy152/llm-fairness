Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  72  56  52  72  55  73
1  31  23  89  83  61  59   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use an algorithm like the "Greedy Allocation" which assigns items based on the highest difference in value between the agents. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuations.
3. Allocate items to the agent that values them more until all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the differences:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 71, Agent 1 values at 31. Difference = 40.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 72, Agent 1 values at 23. Difference = 49.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 56, Agent 1 values at 89. Difference = 33.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 52, Agent 1 values at 83. Difference = 31.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 72, Agent 1 values at 61. Difference = 11.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values at 55, Agent 1 values at 59. Difference = 4.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values at 73, Agent 1 values at 9. Difference = 64.

Now, sort the items based on the absolute differences:

1. Item 6 (64)
2. Item 1 (49)
3. Item 0 (40)
4. Item 2 (33)
5. Item 3 (31)
6. Item 4 (11)
7. Item 5 (4)

Allocate based on who values the item more:

- Item 6: Agent 0
- Item 1: Agent 0
- Item 0: Agent 0
- Item 2: Agent 1
- Item 3: Agent 1
- Item 4: Agent 0
- Item 5: Agent 1

Let's represent this in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value received by each agent based on their preferences while ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items.
