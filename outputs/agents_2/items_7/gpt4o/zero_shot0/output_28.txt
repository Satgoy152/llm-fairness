Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  60  61   7  77  25  35
1  85  64  75  43  88  99   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the strategy of maximizing the total value for each agent by assigning items based on their highest value preferences. We will go through each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most. Here's the allocation process:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 81.
   - Agent 1 values it at 85.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 60.
   - Agent 1 values it at 64.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 61.
   - Agent 1 values it at 75.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 7.
   - Agent 1 values it at 43.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 77.
   - Agent 1 values it at 88.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 25.
   - Agent 1 values it at 99.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 0 values it at 35.
   - Agent 1 values it at 5.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

To ensure fairness, we should try to balance the number of items each agent receives. Since Agent 1 has been allocated 6 items, we need to re-evaluate one item to balance the allocation, aiming for each agent to receive 3 items:

- Reassign Item 0 to Agent 0, since both agents have nearly similar valuations (81 vs 85).

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the number of items between the two agents while considering their valuations.
