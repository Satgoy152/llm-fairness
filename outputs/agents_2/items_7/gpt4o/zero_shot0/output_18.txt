Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  18  75  64  98  12  20
1  74  30  91  93  65  38   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [74 30 91 93 65 38  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim for an allocation that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. This involves analyzing the value each agent assigns to each item and distributing the items accordingly.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [46, 18, 75, 64, 98, 12, 20]
- Agent 1's valuations: [74, 30, 91, 93, 65, 38, 1]

A straightforward approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's do this comparison:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (74 > 46).
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (30 > 18).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (91 > 75).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (93 > 64).
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (98 > 65).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (38 > 12).
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (20 > 1).

This allocation would result in:

- Agent 0 receiving items: [4, 6]
- Agent 1 receiving items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]

Let's express this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
