Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  97  31  58  69  54  22
1  64  24  52  10  34  19  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive. Each agent should receive 3 or 4 items since there are 7 items in total.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. Calculate the total value for each item for each agent.
2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing their total value while ensuring each agent gets 3 or 4 items.

Let's examine the individual valuations:

- Agent 0: [93, 97, 31, 58, 69, 54, 22]
- Agent 1: [64, 24, 52, 10, 34, 19, 59]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can follow these steps:

1. Assign items based on the highest value differential between the two agents, prioritizing the higher value for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution.

Let's allocate:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (93), Item 1 (97), Item 3 (58), Item 5 (54)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (52), Item 4 (34), Item 6 (59)

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the total value each agent receives while maintaining a fair distribution of items. Agent 0 receives items that they value significantly higher than Agent 1, and vice versa.
