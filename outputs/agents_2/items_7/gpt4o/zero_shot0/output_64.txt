Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  98  35  92  39   0  89
1  44  39  80  30  46  22  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44 39 80 30 46 22 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, we can aim for a balanced allocation in terms of total valuation rather than the number of items.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 27 + 98 + 35 + 92 + 39 + 0 + 89 = 380
- Agent 1: 44 + 39 + 80 + 30 + 46 + 22 + 72 = 333

Now, let's allocate the items in a way that each agent gets items they value highly while keeping the total valuation balanced. 

One approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the marginal gain for each agent alternatively. Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (98) - Highest value for Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (80) - Highest value for Agent 1.
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (92) - Second highest for Agent 0 and more than Agent 1's valuation.
4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (46) - More than Agent 0's valuation.
5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (44) - More than Agent 0's valuation.
6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (89) - Highest remaining for Agent 0.
7. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (22) - Only item left, and higher than Agent 0's valuation.

Now, let's see the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4, 0, 5]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 0, 5]
}
```
