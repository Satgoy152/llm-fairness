Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  12  68  89  21   4  16
1  51  59  53  29  38  80  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a greedy approach to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's calculate the valuations first:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 71
- Item 1: 12
- Item 2: 68
- Item 3: 89
- Item 4: 21
- Item 5: 4
- Item 6: 16

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 51
- Item 1: 59
- Item 2: 53
- Item 3: 29
- Item 4: 38
- Item 5: 80
- Item 6: 69

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (71 > 51), so allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (59 > 12), so allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (68 > 53), so allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (89 > 29), so allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (38 > 21), so allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (80 > 4), so allocate to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (69 > 16), so allocate to Agent 1.

Allocations based on the above:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 4, 5, and 6.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
