Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  7   0  13  89  35  68  75
1  4  53  36  50  16  97  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. One approach is to use the "maximum weighted matching" algorithm from graph theory, which can be applied to this kind of problem. Here's how we can fairly allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has higher valuations for items: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
2. **Agent 1** has higher valuations for items: 1.

Based on this, we try to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share considering their valuations. We'll balance the distribution by ensuring both agents get a reasonable total value.

Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2, 3, 4]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 5, 6]

Now, let's present the allocations in the JSON format you requested:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each item is allocated to one agent.
