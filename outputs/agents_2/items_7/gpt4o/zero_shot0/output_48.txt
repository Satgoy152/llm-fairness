Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  43  75  68  93  45  86
1  11  96   2   4  84  81  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach to solve this is using the "Hungarian algorithm" or any optimization strategy that balances the allocations based on the given valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations and try to distribute the items optimally:

```
Valuations:
Agent 0: [27, 43, 75, 68, 93, 45, 86]
Agent 1: [11, 96,  2,  4, 84, 81, 60]
```

To maximize each agent's satisfaction, we should aim to allocate items that each agent values highly. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (93), and item 6 the second highest (86).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (96), and item 5 the second highest (81).

We can try the following allocation to balance the total valuations for each agent:

- Assign items with higher valuations to the corresponding agents.
- Ensure each agent receives a fair share.

Based on the valuations, a reasonable allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5, 6]

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 27 + 75 + 68 + 93 = 263, and Agent 1 a total valuation of 96 + 81 + 60 = 237. This is fairly balanced given the constraints. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5, 6]
}
```
