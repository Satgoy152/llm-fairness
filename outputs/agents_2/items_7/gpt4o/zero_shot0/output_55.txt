Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  30  57  37  90  41  38
1  74  62  66  25  49   1  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. This can be approached as a problem of maximizing the sum of the allocated values for each agent.

Let's examine the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  30  57  37  90  41  38
1  74  62  66  25  49   1  25
```

To distribute the items, we will allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation of those items. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has higher valuations for items 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Agent 1 has higher valuations for items 1.

Thus, the allocations can be as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: [1]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing the value they receive based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1]
}
```
