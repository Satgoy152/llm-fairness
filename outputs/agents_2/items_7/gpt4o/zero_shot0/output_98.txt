Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  80   0   5  78  77  18
1  47  35  63  66  71  56  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed with the given valuations:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.

Here are the allocations based on the given table:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 47, which is more than Agent 0's 38, so it goes to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 80, which is more than Agent 1's 35, so it goes to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 63, which is more than Agent 0's 0, so it goes to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 66, which is more than Agent 0's 5, so it goes to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 78, which is more than Agent 1's 71, so it goes to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 77, which is more than Agent 1's 56, so it goes to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 51, which is more than Agent 0's 18, so it goes to Agent 1.

Based on this allocation, the JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
