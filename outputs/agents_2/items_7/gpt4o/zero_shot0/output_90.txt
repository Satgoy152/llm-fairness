Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  48  52  88  54  90  72
1  19  26  84  16  33  11   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim for maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. This is a classic problem of maximizing total welfare while ensuring fairness.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all the items:

- Agent 0 values: [0, 48, 52, 88, 54, 90, 72]
- Agent 1 values: [19, 26, 84, 16, 33, 11, 7]

Let's try to allocate items in a manner that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

1. Assign the highest-valued item of each agent to them first.
2. Continue assigning the remaining items to the agent who values them more until all items are allocated.

### Allocation Process

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it more (19 vs. 0), so give it to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it more (48 vs. 26), so give it to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it more (84 vs. 52), so give it to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it more (88 vs. 16), so give it to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it more (54 vs. 33), so give it to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it more (90 vs. 11), so give it to Agent 0.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it more (72 vs. 7), so give it to Agent 0.

### Resulting Allocation

After assigning all items, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the value for each agent given their preferences.
