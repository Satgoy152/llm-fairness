Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  42  90  66  51  91  26
1   8  13  86  20  96  36  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One way to achieve this is by using a greedy approach, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. List each item's value for both agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least some items.

Let's perform this allocation based on the given valuations:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| 0    | 32            | 8             |
| 1    | 42            | 13            |
| 2    | 90            | 86            |
| 3    | 66            | 20            |
| 4    | 51            | 96            |
| 5    | 91            | 36            |
| 6    | 26            | 64            |

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (32 vs 8).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (42 vs 13).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (90 vs 86).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (66 vs 20).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (96 vs 51).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (91 vs 36).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (64 vs 26).

Final allocation ensuring both agents receive some items:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 5
- Agent 1: Items 4, 6

This allocation gives Agent 0 five items and Agent 1 two items. All items have been allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [4, 6]
}
```
