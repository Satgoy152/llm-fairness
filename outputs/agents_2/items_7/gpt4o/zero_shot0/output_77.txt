Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  77  20  57  71  91  33
1  46  85  75  57   4  34  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items and aim to maximize their satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will use a simple fair division approach by considering each agentâ€™s preferences.

1. We start by listing each agent's highest valued items and proceed to allocate them in descending order of preference.

2. To ensure fairness, we will alternate the allocations between the two agents, adjusting as necessary if one agent has already received an item.

Let's go through the allocation process:

Agent 0's valuations: [66, 77, 20, 57, 71, 91, 33]
Agent 1's valuations: [46, 85, 75, 57, 4, 34, 87]

Sorting by preference for Agent 0:
- Item 5 (91)
- Item 1 (77)
- Item 4 (71)
- Item 0 (66)
- Item 3 (57)
- Item 6 (33)
- Item 2 (20)

Sorting by preference for Agent 1:
- Item 1 (85)
- Item 2 (75)
- Item 6 (87)
- Item 0 (46)
- Item 3 (57)
- Item 5 (34)
- Item 4 (4)

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 gets Item 5 (91)
2. Agent 1 gets Item 1 (85)
3. Agent 0 gets Item 4 (71)
4. Agent 1 gets Item 6 (87)
5. Agent 0 gets Item 0 (66)
6. Agent 1 gets Item 2 (75)
7. Agent 0 gets Item 3 (57)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share according to their preferences.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 0, 3],
    "1": [1, 6, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive an integer number of items while trying to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.
