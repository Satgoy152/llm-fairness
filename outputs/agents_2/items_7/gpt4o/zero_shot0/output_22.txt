Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  12  79  40   3  75  52
1  14   8  57  93  71  10   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Let's go through the valuations and try to allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 52  
- Item 1: 12  
- Item 2: 79  
- Item 3: 40  
- Item 4: 3  
- Item 5: 75  
- Item 6: 52  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 14  
- Item 1: 8  
- Item 2: 57  
- Item 3: 93  
- Item 4: 71  
- Item 5: 10  
- Item 6: 8  

A possible fair allocation strategy is to give each agent items such that each agent has an equal number of items and the maximum possible valuation given the constraints.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 5, and 0.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 2.

Since both agents highly value item 2, we need to decide based on other preferences:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value: 79 vs. 57)
2. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value: 75 vs. 10)
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value: 52 vs. 14)

4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value: 93 vs. 40)
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value: 71 vs. 3)
6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value: 52 vs. 8)
7. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value: 8 vs. 12)

Now, let's check the allocation and adjust if necessary to ensure each agent has an equal number of items:

Agent 0: [0, 2, 5, 6]  
Agent 1: [1, 3, 4]  

Each agent should have three items. Let's reallocate:

1. Agent 0: [0, 2, 5]  
2. Agent 1: [1, 3, 4, 6]  

This gives Agent 0 three items and Agent 1 four items. We need a balanced allocation with three items each:

1. Reallocate item 6 to Agent 0 and item 5 to Agent 1.

Final Allocation:  
- Agent 0: [0, 2, 6] (Total Valuation: 52 + 79 + 52 = 183)
- Agent 1: [1, 3, 4, 5] (Total Valuation: 8 + 93 + 71 + 10 = 182)

Since we need to balance and ensure three items each, let's try a final reallocation:

- Split item 6 and item 5 differently to balance.

Final Allocation:  
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents have three items and are reasonably satisfied with their valuations.
