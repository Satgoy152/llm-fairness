Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  45  45  27  39  98  38
1  56  27  46   5  55  27  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to use the "envy-free" method, where each agent prefers their own allocation over the other agent's allocation.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign items to each agent based on the highest individual valuations while ensuring the distribution is balanced:

   - Agent 0 has higher valuations on items 0, 1, and 5.
   - Agent 1 has higher valuations on items 2, 3, 4, and 6.

2. Allocate items accordingly:

   - Agent 0: Items 0, 1, and 5
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 4, and 6

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some of the items they value highly. Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
