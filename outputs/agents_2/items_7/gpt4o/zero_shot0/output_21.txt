Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  43  92  56  87  90  62
1  16  95  80  80  55  92  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. A common approach to achieve this is using a method called Envy-Free Allocation, where each agent prefers their own allocation and does not envy the other's allocation. However, given the constraints and the need for a simple allocation, we can use a heuristic approach like maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Sort items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents**: This helps to allocate items where there is the largest difference in preference.

2. **Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation of the item**.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Calculate the difference in valuations**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (35) - Agent 1 (16) = 19
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (43) - Agent 1 (95) = -52
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (92) - Agent 1 (80) = 12
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (56) - Agent 1 (80) = -24
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (87) - Agent 1 (55) = 32
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (90) - Agent 1 (92) = -2
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (62) - Agent 1 (70) = -8

2. **Sort items by absolute differences**:
   - Item 1: -52
   - Item 3: -24
   - Item 6: -8
   - Item 5: -2
   - Item 0: 19
   - Item 2: 12
   - Item 4: 32

3. **Allocate items based on highest valuation**:
   - Agent 0 gets items where their valuation is higher: 0, 2, 4
   - Agent 1 gets items where their valuation is higher: 1, 3, 5, 6

Therefore, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
