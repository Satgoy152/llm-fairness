Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  45  94  66  82  24  17
1  57  28  29  90  85  20  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items, aiming to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a method that aims for an envy-free allocation.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent would receive if they were allocated each item individually:

Agent 0's total valuation for each item:
- Item 0: 8
- Item 1: 45
- Item 2: 94
- Item 3: 66
- Item 4: 82
- Item 5: 24
- Item 6: 17

Agent 1's total valuation for each item:
- Item 0: 57
- Item 1: 28
- Item 2: 29
- Item 3: 90
- Item 4: 85
- Item 5: 20
- Item 6: 73

Next, let's aim to allocate the items such that the difference in total valuation between the agents is minimized, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

By examining the valuations, we can attempt the following allocation:

- Assign items 2, 4, and 6 to Agent 0. The total valuation for Agent 0 is 94 + 82 + 17 = 193.
- Assign items 0, 1, 3, and 5 to Agent 1. The total valuation for Agent 1 is 57 + 28 + 90 + 20 = 195.

This allocation provides a fairly balanced distribution of total valuations between the two agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 5]
}
```
