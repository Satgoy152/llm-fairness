Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  69  78  12  24  88  60
1  75  48  82  50   3  11  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. One approach to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm or a simple optimization method, such as the Hungarian algorithm, to maximize each agent's total value for the items they receive.

Here's a simple way to approach this by assigning items based on the highest difference in values between the two agents:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuations.
3. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more.

Using the given table:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value | Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| 0    | 98            | 75            | 23                             |
| 1    | 69            | 48            | 21                             |
| 2    | 78            | 82            | -4                             |
| 3    | 12            | 50            | -38                            |
| 4    | 24            | 3             | 21                             |
| 5    | 88            | 11            | 77                             |
| 6    | 60            | 37            | 23                             |

Sort the items based on the absolute value of the difference, and allocate each item to the agent with the higher valuation:

1. Item 5: Allocate to Agent 0
2. Item 3: Allocate to Agent 1
3. Item 0: Allocate to Agent 0
4. Item 6: Allocate to Agent 0
5. Item 1: Allocate to Agent 0
6. Item 4: Allocate to Agent 0
7. Item 2: Allocate to Agent 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations for each item.
