Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  76  15  21  64  72  20
1  91  52  71  25  10   3  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to aim for a distribution where both agents derive similar total value from their allocated items. One approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or ensuring an envy-free allocation.

Let's evaluate the total valuation for both agents if they were to get each item:

- **Agent 0**: [12, 76, 15, 21, 64, 72, 20]
- **Agent 1**: [91, 52, 71, 25, 10, 3, 21]

To start, we will allocate items in a way that balances the total valuation for both agents:

1. Allocate items to the agent who values them the most, then balance the total value:

   - Item 0: Agent 1 (91 > 12)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (76 > 52)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (71 > 15)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (25 > 21)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (64 > 10)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (72 > 3)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (20 > 21)

2. Calculate total value for each agent and adjust for fairness:

   - Agent 0: [76, 64, 72, 20] = 232
   - Agent 1: [91, 71, 25] = 187

3. Balance the allocation by swapping items to make total values more equal:

   - Swap Item 6 from Agent 0 to Agent 1:
      - Agent 0: [76, 64, 72] = 212
      - Agent 1: [91, 71, 25, 20] = 207

After adjustments, the allocation is fairly balanced:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
