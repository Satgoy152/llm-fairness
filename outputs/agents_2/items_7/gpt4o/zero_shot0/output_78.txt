Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  34  12  20  99  25  30
1  91  63  39  18  73  60  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation that each agent receives while ensuring each item is assigned to one of the agents.

Let's calculate the total valuation for different allocation scenarios and decide based on fairness (i.e., trying to balance the valuation each agent receives):

1. **Agent 0's preferences:**  
   - Item 0: 42
   - Item 1: 34
   - Item 2: 12
   - Item 3: 20
   - Item 4: 99
   - Item 5: 25
   - Item 6: 30
   
2. **Agent 1's preferences:**  
   - Item 0: 91
   - Item 1: 63
   - Item 2: 39
   - Item 3: 18
   - Item 4: 73
   - Item 5: 60
   - Item 6: 16

To start, let's allocate items based on the highest preference for each agent:

- **Agent 0 values item 4 the most (99).**
- **Agent 1 values item 0 the most (91).**

Next, we continue allocating items while balancing the total valuation for each agent:

- **Agent 1 values item 1 second most (63).**
- **Agent 0 values item 6 next (30).**
- **Agent 1 values item 5 next (60).**
- **Agent 0 values item 2 next (12).**
- **Agent 1 values item 3 next (18).**

After this process, the allocations would be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 2],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair distribution of items based on their preferences, balancing the total valuation each agent receives.
