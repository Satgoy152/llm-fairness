Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  44  65  71  72  84  39
1  25  42   4  70  48  93  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 42  4 70 48 93 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's go through the items and allocate them based on their valuations.

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: [27, 44, 65, 71, 72, 84, 39]
- Agent 1: [25, 42, 4, 70, 48, 93, 79]

### Allocation:
1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 27
   - Agent 1 values it at 25
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 44
   - Agent 1 values it at 42
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 65
   - Agent 1 values it at 4
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 71
   - Agent 1 values it at 70
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 72
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Allocate to Agent 0

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 84
   - Agent 1 values it at 93
   - Allocate to Agent 1

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 39
   - Agent 1 values it at 79
   - Allocate to Agent 1

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 6]

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items while maximizing each agent's valuation of the items they receive.
