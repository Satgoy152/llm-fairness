Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  17  80  48  55  46  58
1  98  63  10  21  15  62  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a simple greedy approach to achieve this by allocating items one by one to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated.

Let's examine the table and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 98, and Agent 0 values it at 26. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 63, and Agent 0 values it at 17. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 80, and Agent 1 values it at 10. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 48, and Agent 1 values it at 21. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 55, and Agent 1 values it at 15. Allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 62, and Agent 0 values it at 46. Allocate to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 58, and Agent 1 values it at 35. Allocate to Agent 0.

With this allocation, each agent receives a total valuation that is as balanced as possible given the constraints.

Now present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
