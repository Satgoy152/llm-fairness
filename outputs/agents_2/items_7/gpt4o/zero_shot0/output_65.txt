Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  51  32   0  97  41  53
1  76  17  57  18   8  83  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [76 17 57 18  8 83 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. List the total valuations for each agent if they received all the items:
   - Agent 0: 66 + 51 + 32 + 0 + 97 + 41 + 53 = 340
   - Agent 1: 76 + 17 + 57 + 18 + 8 + 83 + 42 = 301

2. To ensure fairness, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while keeping the allocation as balanced as possible.

3. Assign items to agents:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 highly (97), so assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 highly (83), so assign item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 0 highly (66), so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 (57), so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 (51), so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 6 (42), so assign item 6 to Agent 1.
   - The remaining item (3) has low value for both, but since Agent 1's total valuation is currently lower, assign item 3 to Agent 1.

4. Final allocation:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 4]
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 5, 6]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
