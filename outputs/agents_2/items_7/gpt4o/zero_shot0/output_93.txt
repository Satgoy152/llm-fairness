Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  24  38  29  16  67   6
1  98  11  32  53  86  87  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. A possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items based on the highest value each agent places on them.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: 47
   - Item 1: 24
   - Item 2: 38
   - Item 3: 29
   - Item 4: 16
   - Item 5: 67
   - Item 6: 6

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0: 98
   - Item 1: 11
   - Item 2: 32
   - Item 3: 53
   - Item 4: 86
   - Item 5: 87
   - Item 6: 81

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values this item significantly higher (98 vs. 47). So, allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values this item more (24 vs. 11). So, allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values this item higher (38 vs. 32). So, allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3:** Agent 1 values this item more (53 vs. 29). So, allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 4:** Agent 1 values this item significantly higher (86 vs. 16). So, allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 5:** Agent 1 values this item slightly more (87 vs. 67). So, allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 6:** Agent 1 values this item significantly higher (81 vs. 6). So, allocate to Agent 1.

Given these allocations, Agent 1 receives more items, but these allocations maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences.

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items such that each agent receives the highest possible total value based on their preferences.
