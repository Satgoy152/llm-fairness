Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  18  62  62  94  59  55
1  74  32  76   4  52  16  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the "envy-free" criterion, meaning each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation. Given the valuations, we aim to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring an integer number of items is distributed to each. Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:  
- Items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
- Values: [51, 18, 62, 62, 94, 59, 55]  

Agent 1:  
- Items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
- Values: [74, 32, 76, 4, 52, 16, 62]  

To find an allocation that seems fair, we can try to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0's High-Value Items**: 4 (94), 2 (62), 3 (62)
2. **Agent 1's High-Value Items**: 2 (76), 0 (74), 6 (62)

We can attempt the following distribution to balance their interests:

- Assign items 0, 5, and 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 1, 2, 3, and 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation results in:

- **Agent 0**: Values = 18 (item 1) + 62 (item 2) + 62 (item 3) + 94 (item 4) = 236
- **Agent 1**: Values = 74 (item 0) + 16 (item 5) + 62 (item 6) = 152

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 a higher total value, but considering their valuation preferences, this method aims to provide a reasonable division based on their highest preferences for certain items. If any further balancing is needed, additional trade-offs could be considered based on specific fairness criteria.
