Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  60  34  81  97   0  33
1  21   8  25  38  20  83  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
    - Agent 0: \(7 + 60 + 34 + 81 + 97 + 0 + 33 = 312\)
    - Agent 1: \(21 + 8 + 25 + 38 + 20 + 83 + 68 = 263\)

2. We need to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

3. A potential fair allocation is achieved by examining various combinations and distributing items to get close total valuations for each agent.

After evaluating different combinations, one fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 5, 6

Calculating the total value for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0's total value: \(7 + 81 + 97 = 185\)
- Agent 1's total value: \(60 + 34 + 83 + 68 = 245\)

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived values as closely as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 6]
}
```
