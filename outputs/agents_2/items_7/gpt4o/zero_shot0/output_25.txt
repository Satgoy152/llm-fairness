Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  69  94  88   1  40  17
1  72   9  14  87  15  23  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72  9 14 87 15 23 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent. The goal is to create a balanced allocation where each agent is satisfied with the items they receive.

### Analysis:
- **Agent 0** valuations: [18, 69, 94, 88, 1, 40, 17]
- **Agent 1** valuations: [72, 9, 14, 87, 15, 23, 80]

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it higher (72 vs. 18).
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it higher (69 vs. 9).
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it higher (94 vs. 14).
4. **Item 3:** Both agents have high valuations, but Agent 0 values it slightly higher (88 vs. 87).
5. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it higher (15 vs. 1).
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it higher (40 vs. 23).
7. **Item 6:** Agent 1 values it higher (80 vs. 17).

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Items 1, 2, 3, 5
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 4, 6

### JSON Result:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and each item is allocated to only one agent.
