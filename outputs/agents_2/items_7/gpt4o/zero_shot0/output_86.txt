Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  71   4  31  44  44  88
1  40  23  16  47  14  85  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a simple greedy approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it most. Here's how the allocation could look:

1. Compare the values of each item for both agents.
2. Allocate the item to the agent who values it more.

Let's apply this to the provided table:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 88, and agent 1 values it at 40. Assign to agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 71, and agent 1 values it at 23. Assign to agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 4, and agent 1 values it at 16. Assign to agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 31, and agent 1 values it at 47. Assign to agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 44, and agent 1 values it at 14. Assign to agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 44, and agent 1 values it at 85. Assign to agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 88, and agent 1 values it at 22. Assign to agent 0.

Based on this allocation, agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 4, and 6, while agent 1 receives items 2, 3, and 5.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
