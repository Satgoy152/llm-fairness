Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  21  55  71  78  97  79
1  34  58   8   5  51  35  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use an approach that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common technique is to use the "greedy" method, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most.

Let's evaluate the items one by one and assign them to the agent with the highest valuation:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 31, and Agent 1 values it at 34.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 21, and Agent 1 values it at 58.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 55, and Agent 1 values it at 8.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 71, and Agent 1 values it at 5.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 78, and Agent 1 values it at 51.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 97, and Agent 1 values it at 35.
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 0 values it at 79, and Agent 1 values it at 12.
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 0.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
