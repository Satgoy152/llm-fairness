Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  17  68   4  75  33  10
1  54  16  47  64   4  64  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54 16 47 64  4 64 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use a greedy method where each agent picks the highest valued item available until all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given table:

1. Agent 0 values the items as follows: `[85, 17, 68, 4, 75, 33, 10]`.
2. Agent 1 values the items as follows: `[54, 16, 47, 64, 4, 64, 68]`.

We will aim to give each agent items that maximize their respective total value:

- For Item 0: Agent 0 values it higher (85 vs 54).
- For Item 1: Agent 0 values it higher (17 vs 16).
- For Item 2: Agent 0 values it higher (68 vs 47).
- For Item 3: Agent 1 values it higher (64 vs 4).
- For Item 4: Agent 0 values it higher (75 vs 4).
- For Item 5: Agent 1 values it higher (64 vs 33).
- For Item 6: Agent 1 values it higher (68 vs 10).

Based on this analysis, we can allocate the items as follows to maximize each agent's value:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 1, 2, 4].
- Agent 1 gets items [3, 5, 6].

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
