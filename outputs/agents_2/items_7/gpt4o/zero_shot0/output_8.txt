Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  76  21  27  62   0  43
1  26  89  76  55  39  75  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 26, and Agent 0 values it at 21. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 89, and Agent 0 values it at 76. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 76, and Agent 0 values it at 21. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 55, and Agent 0 values it at 27. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 62, and Agent 1 values it at 39. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 75, and Agent 0 values it at 0. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 78, and Agent 0 values it at 43. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's look at the distribution:
- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
