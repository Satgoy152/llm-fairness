Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  82  67  69  78  33  97
1  90  69  55  75  15  10  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Below is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 78 + 82 + 67 + 69 + 78 + 33 + 97 = 504
   - Agent 1: 90 + 69 + 55 + 75 + 15 + 10 + 53 = 367

2. To make the allocation fair, we should consider allocating items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

3. We can start by allocating items based on the highest individual valuations first, and then balance them out:

    - Agent 0: Values are highest for items 6 (97), 1 (82), and 0 (78).
    - Agent 1: Values are highest for items 0 (90), 3 (75), and 1 (69).

4. Next, balance the allocations:
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest for Agent 1).

5. Remaining items:
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (67 vs 55).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (78 vs 15).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (10 vs 33, but to balance based on previous allocations).

6. Final allocation:
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 4, 6
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 5

7. Calculate total values for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 82 + 67 + 78 + 97 = 324
   - Agent 1: 90 + 75 + 10 = 175

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 324 and Agent 1 a total value of 175. Although Agent 0 receives more in this distribution, it considers the higher valuations Agent 1 has for certain items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
