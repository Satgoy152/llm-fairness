Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  30  16  99  50   5  84
1  19  86  46  82  90  21  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value while keeping the overall distribution fair.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would get for each possible allocation:

1. Assign items to the agent who values them more until all items are allocated.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure both agents have approximately equal total value.

Here's how the allocation can be done:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [47, 30, 16, 99, 50, 5, 84]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [19, 86, 46, 82, 90, 21, 48]

Steps:
1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 47 vs 19).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 86 vs 30).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 46 vs 16).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 99 vs 82).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 90 vs 50).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 5 vs 21).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 84 vs 48).

Now let's check the total value:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 3, 5, 6] with values [47, 99, 5, 84] totaling 235.
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 2, 4] with values [86, 46, 90] totaling 222.

This allocation is close to being fair, so we'll use it.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
