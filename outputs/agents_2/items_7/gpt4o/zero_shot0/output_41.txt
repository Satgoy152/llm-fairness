Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  90  27  76   0  17  73
1  76  93  99  81  62  93  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. This approach is often referred to as the "maximum sum" allocation, and we'll try to distribute the items such that the sum of the valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here are the steps for allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation = 1 + 90 + 27 + 76 + 0 + 17 + 73 = 284
   - Agent 1's total valuation = 76 + 93 + 99 + 81 + 62 + 93 + 75 = 579

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Each Agent's Valuation:**
   - Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Allocations:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (76 vs 1)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (93 vs 90)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (99 vs 27)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (81 vs 76)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (62 vs 0)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (93 vs 17)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (73 vs 75) - assign to Agent 0 to ensure Agent 0 gets at least one item.

4. **Ensure Fairness:**
   - Since Agent 1 has all items except item 6, we need to balance it a bit more for fairness. One way to do this is to transfer some items to Agent 0 that they value relatively high but Agent 1 values less than other items.
   - Transfer Item 3 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 76, which is relatively high for Agent 0).

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [3, 6]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
