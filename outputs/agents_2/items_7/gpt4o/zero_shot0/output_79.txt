Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  14  81  43  28  54  61
1  97  48  21   6  12  56   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction or total value for each agent. One approach is to use a method similar to the "greedy" algorithm, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 97, and Agent 0 values it at 52. Assign to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 14, and Agent 1 values it at 48. Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 81, and Agent 1 values it at 21. Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 43, and Agent 1 values it at 6. Assign to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 28, and Agent 1 values it at 12. Assign to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 54, and Agent 1 values it at 56. Assign to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 61, and Agent 1 values it at 5. Assign to Agent 0.

The allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 4, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 5]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
