Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  43   0  73  88  62  44
1  16  80  39  67   1  95   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Here's how we can approach the allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on maximizing their individual valuations while keeping the total number of items equal or nearly equal if possible.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

**Agent 0:**
- Item 0: 20
- Item 1: 43
- Item 2: 0
- Item 3: 73
- Item 4: 88
- Item 5: 62
- Item 6: 44

Total valuation for Agent 0 = 20 + 43 + 0 + 73 + 88 + 62 + 44 = 330

**Agent 1:**
- Item 0: 16
- Item 1: 80
- Item 2: 39
- Item 3: 67
- Item 4: 1
- Item 5: 95
- Item 6: 4

Total valuation for Agent 1 = 16 + 80 + 39 + 67 + 1 + 95 + 4 = 302

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize the individual valuations while keeping the allocations balanced:

- Assign Agent 0 the items with higher values according to their preferences.
- Assign Agent 1 the items with higher values according to their preferences.

After analyzing, a fair allocation can be:

- Agent 0: Allocate items [0, 3, 4, 6]
- Agent 1: Allocate items [1, 2, 5]

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: 20 (item 0) + 73 (item 3) + 88 (item 4) + 44 (item 6) = 225
- Agent 1: 80 (item 1) + 39 (item 2) + 95 (item 5) = 214

The allocations are balanced in terms of total valuation received by each agent.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
