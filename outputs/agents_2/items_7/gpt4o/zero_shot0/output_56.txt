Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  54  49  85  60  21  94
1  75   0  98  16  29  16  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [75  0 98 16 29 16 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 84
   - Item 1: 54
   - Item 2: 49
   - Item 3: 85
   - Item 4: 60
   - Item 5: 21
   - Item 6: 94

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 75
   - Item 1: 0
   - Item 2: 98
   - Item 3: 16
   - Item 4: 29
   - Item 5: 16
   - Item 6: 92

To maximize fairness, we should aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest valued items: 6 (94), 3 (85), 0 (84)
  - Total valuation = 94 + 85 + 84 = 263

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest valued items: 2 (98), 6 (92), 0 (75)
  - Total valuation = 98 + 92 + 75 = 265

This allocation maximizes the fairness based on the valuation each agent has for the items.

Adjust the allocations to balance the total value each agent receives:

- **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations while keeping the overall distribution as fair as possible, given the integer constraint.
