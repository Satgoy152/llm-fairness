Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  19   0  15  33  59  20
1  61  71  45  53  31  46  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We can use a greedy algorithm to achieve this allocation. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the allocation:

1. **List the items with their values for each agent:**

   - For Agent 0: 
     - Item 0: 10
     - Item 1: 19
     - Item 2: 0
     - Item 3: 15
     - Item 4: 33
     - Item 5: 59
     - Item 6: 20

   - For Agent 1: 
     - Item 0: 61
     - Item 1: 71
     - Item 2: 45
     - Item 3: 53
     - Item 4: 31
     - Item 5: 46
     - Item 6: 69

2. **Calculate the preference difference for each item, which is the absolute difference between the valuations of the two agents for that item.**

3. **Sort the items based on the preference difference in descending order.**

4. **Allocate items to agents starting from the largest preference difference, giving the item to the agent who values it more.**

5. **Continue until all items are allocated.**

Following this procedure, we get the following allocation:

- Item 1 has the highest preference difference (52), and Agent 1 values it more, so it is allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 0 has the next highest preference difference (51), and Agent 1 values it more, so it is allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 5 has the next preference difference (13), and Agent 0 values it more, so it is allocated to Agent 0.
- Item 6 has the next preference difference (11), and Agent 1 values it more, so it is allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 3 has the next preference difference (38), and Agent 1 values it more, so it is allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 4 has the next preference difference (2), and Agent 0 values it more, so it is allocated to Agent 0.
- Item 2 has the next preference difference (45), and Agent 1 values it more, so it is allocated to Agent 1.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [1, 0, 6, 3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is based on maximizing the valuation for each agent.
