Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  97  96  69  64  78  70
1  87  27  78  38  52  66   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total value each agent receives. The goal is to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the allocation is as balanced as possible in terms of value.

Let's start by looking at the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 0
- Item 1: 97
- Item 2: 96
- Item 3: 69
- Item 4: 64
- Item 5: 78
- Item 6: 70

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 87
- Item 1: 27
- Item 2: 78
- Item 3: 38
- Item 4: 52
- Item 5: 66
- Item 6: 5

We can try to maximize the total value by assigning items based on the highest valuation where possible:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (87 vs. 0) - higher for Agent 1.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (97 vs. 27) - higher for Agent 0.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (96 vs. 78) - higher for Agent 0.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (69 vs. 38) - higher for Agent 0.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (52 vs. 64) - higher for Agent 0 (corrected for balance).
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (66 vs. 78) - higher for Agent 0 (corrected for balance).
7. Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (70 vs. 5) - higher for Agent 0.

To ensure a fair distribution, we want each agent to have a similar total valuation from the items they receive. After assigning items with this method, let's check the allocations:

Agent 0 gets items 1, 2, 3, 6.
Agent 1 gets items 0, 4, 5.

Now, we can present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and attempts to balance the total value each agent receives.
