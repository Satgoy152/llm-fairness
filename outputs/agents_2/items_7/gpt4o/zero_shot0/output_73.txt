Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  41  61  74  51  32  88
1   0  13  96  87  44   5  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each gets a fair number of items. Let's first calculate the total value each agent gives to all items and then try to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation is relatively balanced.

Here are the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 17 + 41 + 61 + 74 + 51 + 32 + 88 = 364
- Agent 1: 0 + 13 + 96 + 87 + 44 + 5 + 36 = 281

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. We will prioritize giving each item to the agent who values it more.
2. We aim to make sure each agent gets 3 or 4 items in total (since there are 7 items).

Let's allocate the items one by one:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 17, Agent 1 values it at 0. Give to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 values it at 13. Give to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 96. Give to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 values it at 87. Give to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 values it at 44. Give to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 values it at 5. Give to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 values it at 36. Give to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the allocation to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0 has items: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6
- Agent 1 has items: 2, 3

Agent 0 received 5 items, and Agent 1 received 2 items. To balance this more evenly, let's adjust:

- Move item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0 has items: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Agent 1 has items: 2, 3, 5

This gives each agent 4 and 3 items respectively, which is more balanced.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
