Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6   4  85  73  12  68  83
1  92  87  40  39  25  57  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5
   - Total Value: 6 + 4 + 73 + 12 + 68 = 163

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: 2, 6
   - Total Value: 40 + 83 = 123

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 6]
}
```
