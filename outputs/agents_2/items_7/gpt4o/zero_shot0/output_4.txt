Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2  3   4   5   6
0  47  20  41  4  88  76  92
1  25  40   7  8  61   3  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 40  7  8 61  3 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. One common method to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed with the given data:

1. **Identify the Value Matrix:**

   ```
   Agent 0: [47, 20, 41, 4, 88, 76, 92]
   Agent 1: [25, 40, 7, 8, 61, 3, 60]
   ```

2. **Allocate Items:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 47, and Agent 1 values it at 25. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 20, and Agent 1 values it at 40. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 41, and Agent 1 values it at 7. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 4, and Agent 1 values it at 8. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 88, and Agent 1 values it at 61. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 76, and Agent 1 values it at 3. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 92, and Agent 1 values it at 60. Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Resulting Allocations:**

   - Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 4, 5, 6]
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 3]

4. **Present the Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and maximizes the value each agent receives based on their preferences.
