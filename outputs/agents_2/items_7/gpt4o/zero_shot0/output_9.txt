Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36   2  39  56   4  14  61
1  63  10  49  80  54  11  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to balance the total valuations each agent receives. One approach is to use a method that seeks to equalize the total value of items assigned to each agent as closely as possible.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on each item:

Agent 0:  
- Items: 0 (36), 1 (2), 2 (39), 3 (56), 4 (4), 5 (14), 6 (61)  
- Total value of all items for Agent 0: 36 + 2 + 39 + 56 + 4 + 14 + 61 = 212

Agent 1:  
- Items: 0 (63), 1 (10), 2 (49), 3 (80), 4 (54), 5 (11), 6 (91)  
- Total value of all items for Agent 1: 63 + 10 + 49 + 80 + 54 + 11 + 91 = 358

Now, let's try to allocate the items in a way that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible:

1. Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1).
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (third highest value for Agent 1).
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (fourth highest value for Agent 1).
5. Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (balance the allocation).
6. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (balance the allocation).
7. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (balance the allocation).

After allocation, the total values are:

- Agent 0:  
  - Items: 1 (2), 4 (4), 5 (14)  
  - Total value: 2 + 4 + 14 = 20

- Agent 1:  
  - Items: 0 (36), 2 (39), 3 (56), 6 (61)  
  - Total value: 36 + 39 + 56 + 61 = 192

This allocation balances the total valuation between the agents as much as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
