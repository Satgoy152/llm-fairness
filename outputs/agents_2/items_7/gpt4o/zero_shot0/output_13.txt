Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  37  35  22  28  16  33
1  57   6  12  85   2  90  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [57  6 12 85  2 90 79]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we want to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they get. Let's evaluate a strategy to do this:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values for items: [25, 37, 35, 22, 28, 16, 33]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values for items: [57, 6, 12, 85, 2, 90, 79]

We can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 57, Agent 0 values it at 25. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 values it at 6. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 values it at 12. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 85, Agent 0 values it at 22. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 values it at 2. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 90, Agent 0 values it at 16. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 79, Agent 0 values it at 33. Assign to Agent 1.

Based on this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 3, 5, and 6.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
