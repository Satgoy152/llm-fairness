Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  68  14  93  89  69  53
1  68  97  64  89  57  51  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize their satisfaction. We can do this by allocating items in such a way that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 3, Agent 1 values it at 68.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 values it at 97.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 values it at 64.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 values it at 89.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 89, Agent 1 values it at 57.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 values it at 51.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 values it at 65.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

With these allocations, we attempt to balance the total value each agent receives, given their preferences. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6]
}
```
