Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  75  29  72  76  37  57
1  38   4  98  27  31  20  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations:** 1, 75, 29, 72, 76, 37, 57
2. **Agent 1 Valuations:** 38, 4, 98, 27, 31, 20, 81

We'll allocate items based on the highest valuations while ensuring a fair distribution of items:

- First, assign the item with the highest valuation to the respective agent and then alternate to balance the distribution.
- Ensure each agent receives a similar number of items.

Following this strategy:

1. **Agent 1 gets item 2** (value of 98)
2. **Agent 0 gets item 4** (value of 76)
3. **Agent 0 gets item 1** (value of 75)
4. **Agent 0 gets item 3** (value of 72)
5. **Agent 1 gets item 6** (value of 81)
6. **Agent 0 gets item 5** (value of 37)
7. **Agent 1 gets item 0** (value of 38)

The allocations in JSON format based on the above reasoning would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items fairly while respecting each agent's valuation preferences.
