Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  73  10  40  97  94  17
1  81  11  19  69  80  78  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Compute the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. **Greedy Allocation**: Start by assigning the item to the agent who values it most, then check if the allocation is fair. If necessary, adjust the allocation to ensure fairness.

Let's calculate the total valuation:

- Agent 0's total value for all items: 95 + 73 + 10 + 40 + 97 + 94 + 17 = 426
- Agent 1's total value for all items: 81 + 11 + 19 + 69 + 80 + 78 + 36 = 374

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 values it at 81. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 values it at 11. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 10, Agent 1 values it at 19. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 values it at 69. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 values it at 80. Allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 94, Agent 1 values it at 78. Allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 17, Agent 1 values it at 36. Allocate to Agent 1.

After allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 6]

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and attempts to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences.
