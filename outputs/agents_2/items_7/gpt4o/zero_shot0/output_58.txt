Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  84  96  21  23  83  49
1  29  75  89  52   1  63  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of both agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We can start by examining the valuations and assigning items based on the highest value per agent until all items are allocated. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 0, valued at 96 (highest value for agent 0).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 0, valued at 93 (next highest value for agent 0).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 1, valued at 75 (highest value for agent 1).
4. Assign item 6 to agent 1, valued at 83 (next highest value for agent 1).
5. Assign item 5 to agent 0, valued at 83 (next highest remaining value for agent 0).
6. Assign item 3 to agent 1, valued at 52.
7. Assign item 4 to agent 0, valued at 23.

With these assignments, each agent receives 3 or 4 items. The final allocation based on the values is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 5, 4],
    "1": [1, 6, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
