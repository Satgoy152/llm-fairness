Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  60   2  43  19   2  50
1   5  24  94  14  26  79  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple method called "maximum marginal utility." This approach attempts to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated. Here's the step-by-step allocation for the given valuations:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most and allocate it to that agent.
2. After each allocation, remove the allocated item from consideration.

Let's apply this method to the given table:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 | Allocated to |
|------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 0    | 21      | 5       | 0            |
| 1    | 60      | 24      | 0            |
| 2    | 2       | 94      | 1            |
| 3    | 43      | 14      | 0            |
| 4    | 19      | 26      | 1            |
| 5    | 2       | 79      | 1            |
| 6    | 50      | 18      | 0            |

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 3, and 6, while Agent 1 receives items 2, 4, and 5. This allocation is based on maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive.
