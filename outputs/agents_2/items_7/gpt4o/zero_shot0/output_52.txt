Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  61  34  11  26  70  61
1  74   5  61  54  24  43  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring an integer number of items for each agent. Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 20
   - Item 1: 61
   - Item 2: 34
   - Item 3: 11
   - Item 4: 26
   - Item 5: 70
   - Item 6: 61

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 74
   - Item 1: 5
   - Item 2: 61
   - Item 3: 54
   - Item 4: 24
   - Item 5: 43
   - Item 6: 27

The goal is to allocate items so that both agents have an equitable total valuation. We can use a heuristic to assign items by focusing on the highest valuations each agent has for different items while ensuring fairness.

### Allocation Plan:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 1 (Value: 61)
  - Item 5 (Value: 70)
  - Item 6 (Value: 61)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0 (Value: 74)
  - Item 2 (Value: 61)
  - Item 3 (Value: 54)
  - Item 4 (Value: 24)

### Verification:
- **Agent 0's Total Valuation:** 61 + 70 + 61 = 192
- **Agent 1's Total Valuation:** 74 + 61 + 54 + 24 = 213

While Agent 1 has a slightly higher total valuation, both agents receive a fair share of high-value items.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items with an attempt to balance the total valuation as fairly as possible given the constraints.
