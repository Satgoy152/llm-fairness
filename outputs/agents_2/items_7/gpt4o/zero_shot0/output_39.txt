Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  48   2  68  57  46  28
1  78   8  83  34  27   7  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to divide the total value of items as evenly as possible between the two agents, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

First, let's calculate the total value of items for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [14, 48, 2, 68, 57, 46, 28]
- Total value for Agent 0: 14 + 48 + 2 + 68 + 57 + 46 + 28 = 263

- Agent 1's valuations: [78, 8, 83, 34, 27, 7, 16]
- Total value for Agent 1: 78 + 8 + 83 + 34 + 27 + 7 + 16 = 253

Now we proceed with an allocation strategy that tries to balance the total values received by each agent.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Assign high-value items based on each agent's preference:**
   - Item 2 (83) is highly valued by Agent 1, so allocate it to Agent 1.
   - Item 3 (68) is highly valued by Agent 0, so allocate it to Agent 0.

2. **Balance remaining items:**
   - Consider remaining high-value items and allocate them such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's allocate items based on the strategy:

- Agent 1 gets Item 2.
- Agent 0 gets Item 3.

Remaining items and their valuations for each agent:

- Remaining items: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6
- Agent 0 valuations: [14, 48, 57, 46, 28]
- Agent 1 valuations: [78, 8, 27, 7, 16]

3. **Allocate remaining items to balance the total values:**

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.
- Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 3, 4, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 5]

This allocation attempts to balance the total values received by each agent. Let's represent this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
