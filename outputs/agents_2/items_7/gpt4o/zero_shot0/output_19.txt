Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  35  89  34  92  89  44
1  24   6  48  65  88  25  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives by considering each agent's preferences. A fair allocation means that each agent should ideally have a roughly equal share of the total value based on their valuations. Let's calculate the total valuation for each item and distribute them to maximize fairness.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each item.

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 values it at 24.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 values it at 6.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 89, Agent 1 values it at 48.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 values it at 65.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 88.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 89, Agent 1 values it at 25.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 44, Agent 1 values it at 28.

Now, let's allocate the items to ensure fairness. We can start by allocating items based on which agent values them more:

1. Item 0: Allocated to Agent 0 (70 > 24)
2. Item 1: Allocated to Agent 0 (35 > 6)
3. Item 2: Allocated to Agent 0 (89 > 48)
4. Item 3: Allocated to Agent 1 (65 > 34)
5. Item 4: Allocated to Agent 0 (92 > 88)
6. Item 5: Allocated to Agent 0 (89 > 25)
7. Item 6: Allocated to Agent 0 (44 > 28)

Upon initial allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, and Agent 1 receives item 3. This allocation is heavily skewed towards Agent 0, as they receive significantly more value.

To better balance the allocation, we can review and reallocate one or more items:

- Reallocate item 5 to Agent 1, even though it's valued less by Agent 1, to balance the total value received by each agent.

After this adjustment, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 5.

Finally, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [3, 5]
}
```
