Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  44   2  95  71  61  34
1  51  39  87  80  22  51  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total utility or value for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We should try to allocate items such that the sum of values for each agent is balanced, or as close as possible.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [86, 44, 2, 95, 71, 61, 34]
- Agent 1: [51, 39, 87, 80, 22, 51, 33]

Here’s one way to allocate the items fairly:

1. Start by assigning the highest value items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring both agents receive a fair number of items.
2. Try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with these steps:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values this at 86, Agent 1 at 51. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values this at 44, Agent 1 at 39. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values this at 2, Agent 1 at 87. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values this at 95, Agent 1 at 80. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values this at 71, Agent 1 at 22. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values this at 61, Agent 1 at 51. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values this at 34, Agent 1 at 33. Allocate to Agent 0.

After this allocation, Agent 0 has 6 items, and Agent 1 has 1 item. To balance the number of items, we can adjust by giving Item 5 to Agent 1, as it's the least costly switch in terms of value loss for Agent 0.

Here’s the final allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 3, 4, 6]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 5]
}
```
