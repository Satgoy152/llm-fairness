Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  40   8  48  26  59  98
1  79  19  52  79  41  89  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. We'll use a simple method to allocate items based on maximizing the total perceived value for each agent.

Let's compare the value each agent assigns to each item and allocate the item to the agent that values it more:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 39, and Agent 1 values it at 79. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 40, and Agent 1 values it at 19. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 8, and Agent 1 values it at 52. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 48, and Agent 1 values it at 79. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 26, and Agent 1 values it at 41. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 59, and Agent 1 values it at 89. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 98, and Agent 1 values it at 11. Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation assigns items to the agents based on their valuations, ensuring each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value.
