Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  68  78  18  80  42  47
1  37  62  81  86  27  94  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can look at the valuations and try to balance the total value each agent receives. We'll aim to make the sum of the values for each agent as equal as possible.

Let's calculate the total value for each agent if they were to receive each item:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 99
- Item 1: 68
- Item 2: 78
- Item 3: 18
- Item 4: 80
- Item 5: 42
- Item 6: 47

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 37
- Item 1: 62
- Item 2: 81
- Item 3: 86
- Item 4: 27
- Item 5: 94
- Item 6: 58

Now, let's allocate the items to balance the total values:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 99) and Agent 1 (value 37).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 68) and Agent 1 (value 62).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (value 81) and Agent 0 (value 78).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (value 86) and Agent 0 (value 18).
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (value 80) and Agent 1 (value 27).
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (value 94) and Agent 0 (value 42).
7. Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (value 47) and Agent 1 (value 58).

Let's calculate the total values for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0, Item 1, Item 4, Item 6
  - Total value: 99 + 68 + 80 + 47 = 294

- Agent 1: Item 2, Item 3, Item 5
  - Total value: 81 + 86 + 94 = 261

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 294 and Agent 1 a total value of 261. This is a relatively fair distribution based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
