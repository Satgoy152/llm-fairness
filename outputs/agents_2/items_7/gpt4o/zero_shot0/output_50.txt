Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15   0  16  18  71  78  15
1  31  91  32  71  23  15  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's evaluate a possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations: [15, 0, 16, 18, 71, 78, 15]  
Agent 1's valuations: [31, 91, 32, 71, 23, 15, 28]

We'll allocate items to maximize each agent's total value:

1. **Agent 0** should prioritize items with higher valuations for them:
   - Item 5: Value 78
   - Item 4: Value 71
   - Item 3: Value 18
   - Item 6: Value 15
   - Item 2: Value 16
   - Item 0: Value 15

2. **Agent 1** should also prioritize their highest valuations:
   - Item 1: Value 91

Since Agent 1 has a very high valuation for Item 1 compared to Agent 0, it is optimal to allocate Item 1 to Agent 1. Let's assign the remaining items to Agent 0 as they have no interest in Item 1.

Here is the allocation based on the above reasoning:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.
