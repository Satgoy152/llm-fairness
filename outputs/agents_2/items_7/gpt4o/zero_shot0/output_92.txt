Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  80  92  53   0  81  23
1  48  86  69  44  50  50   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. This can be approached as an optimization problem, such as using a greedy strategy or a more sophisticated method like solving an assignment problem.

Given the valuations:

```
0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  80  92  53   0  81  23
1  48  86  69  44  50  50   2
```

We can start by assigning items to the agent who values them most:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 58, and Agent 1 values it at 48. Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 80, and Agent 1 values it at 86. Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 92, and Agent 1 values it at 69. Assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 53, and Agent 1 values it at 44. Assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 0, and Agent 1 values it at 50. Assign to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 81, and Agent 1 values it at 50. Assign to Agent 0.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 23, and Agent 1 values it at 2. Assign to Agent 0.

The allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers maximizing the value each agent receives based on their individual preferences.
