Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  65  84  11  64  13   6
1  60  48  91  85   3  33  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. Here's one way to achieve a fair distribution:

1. List the items with their valuations for both agents:

   - Item 0: Agent 0 = 20, Agent 1 = 60
   - Item 1: Agent 0 = 65, Agent 1 = 48
   - Item 2: Agent 0 = 84, Agent 1 = 91
   - Item 3: Agent 0 = 11, Agent 1 = 85
   - Item 4: Agent 0 = 64, Agent 1 = 3
   - Item 5: Agent 0 = 13, Agent 1 = 33
   - Item 6: Agent 0 = 6, Agent 1 = 44

2. Calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items to understand the distribution of values:

   - Total for Agent 0: 263
   - Total for Agent 1: 364

3. Allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while maintaining an equal number of items (3 items per agent, and 1 item will be left unallocated for better fairness):

   - Allocate items based on the highest relative value to each agent.

   - Agent 0:
     - Item 1 (Agent 0: 65, Agent 1: 48)
     - Item 2 (Agent 0: 84, Agent 1: 91)
     - Item 4 (Agent 0: 64, Agent 1: 3)

   - Agent 1:
     - Item 0 (Agent 0: 20, Agent 1: 60)
     - Item 3 (Agent 0: 11, Agent 1: 85)
     - Item 5 (Agent 0: 13, Agent 1: 33)

4. Check if there's a balance or need for adjustment based on the remaining item:

   - Item 6: (Agent 0: 6, Agent 1: 44)

   Since Agent 1 has a higher valuation for the remaining item, it can be allocated to them to balance the overall allocation.

5. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 three items with relatively high values for them, and Agent 1 gets four items, including the one with a higher value for them, balancing the fair distribution.
