Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  80  43  42  50  94  66
1  53   6   5  61  90   9  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53  6  5 61 90  9 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider the total value each agent assigns to the items and aim to balance these values as closely as possible while ensuring each agent gets a discrete number of items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 62 + 80 + 43 + 42 + 50 + 94 + 66 = 437
- Agent 1: 53 + 6 + 5 + 61 + 90 + 9 + 89 = 313

Now, let's try to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

A possible allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 2, 5 (total value = 62 + 80 + 43 + 94 = 279)
- Agent 1 receives items: 3, 4, 6 (total value = 61 + 90 + 89 = 240)

This allocation gives a reasonable balance between the total values received by each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
