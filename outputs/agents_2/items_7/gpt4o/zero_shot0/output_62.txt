Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  68  17  16  66  87  16
1  29  79  22  42  43   5  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. One approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum bipartite matching" or "knapsack problem" to ensure a fair and efficient distribution of items.

First, let's summarize the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [74, 68, 17, 16, 66, 87, 16]
- Agent 1: [29, 79, 22, 42, 43, 5, 23]

Now, we'll allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent. We can use a greedy approach, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, ensuring both agents get a similar number of items.

### Allocation Strategy

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.
3. Ensure that both agents receive a balanced number of items.

### Step-by-step Allocation

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 values it at 29. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 values it at 79. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 17, Agent 1 values it at 22. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 16, Agent 1 values it at 42. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 values it at 43. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 values it at 5. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 16, Agent 1 values it at 23. Allocate to Agent 1.

Based on this allocation, each agent receives three items, and the allocation is balanced.
