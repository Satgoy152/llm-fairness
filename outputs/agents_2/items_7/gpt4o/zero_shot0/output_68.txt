Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3  4   5   6
0  90  69  75  26  4  54  99
1  56  15   4   9  8  44  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. One way to achieve this is by maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each possible allocation and ensure we distribute the items as evenly as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 90
   - Item 1: 69
   - Item 2: 75
   - Item 3: 26
   - Item 4: 4
   - Item 5: 54
   - Item 6: 99

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 56
   - Item 1: 15
   - Item 2: 4
   - Item 3: 9
   - Item 4: 8
   - Item 5: 44
   - Item 6: 38

### Allocation Strategy:
- We will allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair number of items.

**Allocation:**
- Item 0: Agent 0 (90 vs. 56)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (69 vs. 15)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (75 vs. 4)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (9 vs. 26)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (8 vs. 4)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (54 vs. 44)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (99 vs. 38)

**Final Allocation:**
- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6
- Agent 1 gets items: 3, 4

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
