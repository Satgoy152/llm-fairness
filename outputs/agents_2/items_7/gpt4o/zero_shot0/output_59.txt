Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1  2   3   4   5   6
0  29  86  0   3   0  45  48
1  77  64  9  77  78  74  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 64  9 77 78 74 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent has for their assigned items. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Value 29
   - Item 5: Value 45
   - Item 6: Value 48

   Total valuation for Agent 0: 29 + 45 + 48 = 122

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 1: Value 64
   - Item 2: Value 9
   - Item 3: Value 77
   - Item 4: Value 78

   Total valuation for Agent 1: 64 + 9 + 77 + 78 = 228

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations of the items. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
