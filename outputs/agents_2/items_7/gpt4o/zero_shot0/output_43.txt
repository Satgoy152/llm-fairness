Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  77  27   4  40  92  78
1   9  12  57  60  64  36   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 9 12 57 60 64 36  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, I will use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

   - Agent 0: 33 + 77 + 27 + 4 + 40 + 92 + 78 = 351
   - Agent 1: 9 + 12 + 57 + 60 + 64 + 36 + 0 = 238

2. Allocate items to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness. Given there are 7 items, one agent will get 4 items, and the other will get 3 items. Agent 0 has a higher total valuation, so they should get more items.

3. Allocate items:

   - Agent 0 should receive items that maximize their total valuation, while Agent 1 should receive items that maximize their valuation from the remaining items.

4. Allocation based on maximizing individual agent's total valuation:

   - Agent 0 receives items: 1, 5, 6
   - Agent 1 receives items: 0, 2, 3, 4

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
