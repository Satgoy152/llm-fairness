Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83   8  22  53  84  59   8
1  57  15  77  78  63  32  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest value difference between the two agents.

Let's calculate the value difference for each item and allocate accordingly:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 83, Agent 1 values it at 57. Difference = 83 - 57 = 26 (Allocate to Agent 0)
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 values it at 15. Difference = 15 - 8 = 7 (Allocate to Agent 1)
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 77. Difference = 77 - 22 = 55 (Allocate to Agent 1)
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 values it at 78. Difference = 78 - 53 = 25 (Allocate to Agent 1)
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 values it at 63. Difference = 84 - 63 = 21 (Allocate to Agent 0)
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 values it at 32. Difference = 59 - 32 = 27 (Allocate to Agent 0)
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 values it at 68. Difference = 68 - 8 = 60 (Allocate to Agent 1)

The allocation, based on the calculations above, is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0, 4, and 5, while Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 3, and 6. This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on the differences.
