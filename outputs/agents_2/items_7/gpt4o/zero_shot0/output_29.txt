Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  67  34  13  52  23  86
1  96  84  64  64  22  98  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [96 84 64 64 22 98 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's examine the values each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0 values: [90, 67, 34, 13, 52, 23, 86]
- Agent 1 values: [96, 84, 64, 64, 22, 98, 88]

We can approach this allocation problem by considering the total value each agent assigns to all items and attempt to distribute items so that each agent's sum of assigned item values is as balanced as possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Assign items with higher differences in values to the agent valuing them more.
2. Balance the remaining items to keep total values close.

Allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (96 vs. 90)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (84 vs. 67)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (64 vs. 34)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (13 vs. 64)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (52 vs. 22)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (98 vs. 23)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (86 vs. 88)

The resulting allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation considers maximizing the value for each agent while maintaining a fair distribution of items.
