Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4   3  35  95  39  86  80
1  96  79   6  44  40   3  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm based on the highest individual valuations.

First, let's list the items with their values for each agent:

- Agent 0: [4, 3, 35, 95, 39, 86, 80]
- Agent 1: [96, 79, 6, 44, 40, 3, 11]

To make a fair allocation, we can look at each item's valuation difference between agents and allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's proceed with this method:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 96, Agent 0 at 4. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 79, Agent 0 at 3. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 at 6. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 at 44. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 at 40. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 at 3. Allocate to Agent 0.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 at 11. Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation gives us:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 4

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
