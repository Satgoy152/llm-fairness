Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  42  28  60  14  82  27
1  12  88   4  55  67  38  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 88  4 55 67 38 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total value each agent receives. One way to do this is by evaluating the value each agent assigns to each item and then ensuring that both agents get a fair share of the total value available.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 56 + 42 + 28 + 60 + 14 + 82 + 27 = 309
- Agent 1's total valuation: 12 + 88 + 4 + 55 + 67 + 38 + 93 = 357

We want to allocate the items such that both agents are satisfied with the value they receive.

Let's start by assigning items one by one to maximize the value for each agent:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (56 vs 12), so we assign it to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (88 vs 42), so we assign it to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (28 vs 4), so we assign it to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (60 vs 55), so we assign it to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (67 vs 14), so we assign it to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (82 vs 38), so we assign it to Agent 0.
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (93 vs 27), so we assign it to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the total valuation each agent receives:

- Agent 0: 56 (Item 0) + 28 (Item 2) + 60 (Item 3) + 82 (Item 5) = 226
- Agent 1: 88 (Item 1) + 67 (Item 4) + 93 (Item 6) = 248

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the value each agent receives based on their individual preferences.
