Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  11  31  65  51  31  23
1  22  13  75  76  85   5  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent and aim for a balanced distribution of total value. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: Calculate the total value of all items for each agent.
   - Agent 0 total value: 86 + 11 + 31 + 65 + 51 + 31 + 23 = 298
   - Agent 1 total value: 22 + 13 + 75 + 76 + 85 + 5 + 60 = 336

2. **Allocate Items Considering Valuation**: We aim to allocate items to balance the total value for each agent.

3. **Proposed Allocation**:
   - Assign items 0, 3, 5, 6 to Agent 0.
   - Assign items 1, 2, 4 to Agent 1.

4. **Calculate Allocated Value**:
   - Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, 5, 6: 86 + 65 + 31 + 23 = 205
   - Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 4: 13 + 75 + 85 = 173

This allocation provides a reasonable balance considering the total potential value for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the given valuations.
