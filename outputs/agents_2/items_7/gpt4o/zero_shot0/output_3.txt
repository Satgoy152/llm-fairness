Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  74  76  39  63  65  55
1  30  52  90  56  61  60  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90 74 76 39 63 65 55]
 [30 52 90 56 61 60 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for every item and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [90, 74, 76, 39, 63, 65, 55]
- Agent 1 values: [30, 52, 90, 56, 61, 60, 65]

Hereâ€™s a logical approach to fairly allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: High value for Agent 0 (90), low value for Agent 1 (30). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Higher value for Agent 0 (74) than Agent 1 (52). Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Equal highest value for both agents (90). Allocate to Agent 1 to balance high-value items.
4. **Item 3**: Higher value for Agent 1 (56) than Agent 0 (39). Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Similar values for both agents, slightly higher for Agent 0 (63). Allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Slightly higher value for Agent 0 (65) than Agent 1 (60). Allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Higher value for Agent 1 (65) than Agent 0 (55). Allocate to Agent 1.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, considering each agent's preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
