Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  78  49   2  81  52  97
1  29  72  38  89  86  55  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's proceed with allocating the items to the agents:

1. **Agent 0's total possible value**: 85 + 78 + 49 + 2 + 81 + 52 + 97 = 444
2. **Agent 1's total possible value**: 29 + 72 + 38 + 89 + 86 + 55 + 67 = 436

Given that both agents have nearly equal cumulative valuations over all items, one approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring fairness by balancing the number of items each agent receives. Let's assign items one by one based on the highest valuation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 85, Agent 1 at 29. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 at 72. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 at 38. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 at 89. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 at 86. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 52, Agent 1 at 55. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 at 67. Assign to Agent 0.

This allocation results in each agent receiving 3 or 4 items:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2, 6 (Total value = 85 + 78 + 49 + 97 = 309)
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 5 (Total value = 89 + 86 + 55 = 230)

This allocation is fair in terms of number of items and relatively balanced in terms of the value each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
