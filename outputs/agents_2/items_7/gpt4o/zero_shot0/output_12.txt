Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  14  57  70  59  33   4
1  46  97  28  88   0   0  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46 97 28 88  0  0 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuation table, we can aim to distribute the items so that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the total value for each allocation possibility and find a fair allocation:

1. Agent 0's valuations: [11, 14, 57, 70, 59, 33, 4]
2. Agent 1's valuations: [46, 97, 28, 88, 0, 0, 51]

We can try to balance the allocations based on their respective values:

- Allocate items 0, 2, 4, 5, 6 to Agent 0
  - Total value for Agent 0: 11 + 57 + 59 + 33 + 4 = 164
- Allocate items 1, 3 to Agent 1
  - Total value for Agent 1: 97 + 88 = 185

This allocation gives a somewhat balanced approach considering the high value Agent 1 places on items 1 and 3. The total values are not perfectly equal but take into account the substantial differences in valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
