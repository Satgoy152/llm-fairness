Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2  3   4   5   6
0  83  58  47  9  30  81  75
1  19   8  97  7  24  10  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they received the best possible allocation based on their preferences.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [83, 58, 47, 9, 30, 81, 75]
- Agent 1: [19, 8, 97, 7, 24, 10, 87]

To achieve envy-freeness, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives from their bundle of items. Here's a possible approach:

1. **Assign item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (97), which is substantially more than Agent 0's valuation (47).

2. **Assign item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (83), and Agent 1 has a relatively low valuation for it (19).

3. **Assign item 6 to Agent 1**: The next highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 6 (87), and it is lower for Agent 0 (75).

4. **Assign item 5 to Agent 0**: The next highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 5 (81), and it is lower for Agent 1 (10).

5. **Assign item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 1 (58) significantly more than Agent 1 (8).

6. **Assign item 4 to Agent 1**: Both agents have relatively low valuations for item 4, but it contributes better to envy-freeness for Agent 1 (24 vs. 30 for Agent 0).

7. **Assign item 3 to Agent 1**: Both agents have very low valuations for item 3, but giving it to Agent 1 helps balance the number of items without significantly impacting valuations.

This allocation strategy aims to maximize the perceived value each agent gets from their bundle, while also keeping the distribution balanced. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
