Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  37  32  26  32  54  26
1  66  79  94  60   8  42  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their perceived value and ideally minimizes envy between the agents. Let's follow these steps:

1. **List the Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items.

    - Agent 0: 1 + 37 + 32 + 26 + 32 + 54 + 26 = 208
    - Agent 1: 66 + 79 + 94 + 60 + 8 + 42 + 48 = 397

2. **Determine the Importance of Each Item**: We'll look at the difference in valuations for each item to determine which agent values each item more significantly.

3. **Assign Items to Maximize Total Value**: Assign items based on the higher valuation:
    - Item 0: Agent 0 = 1, Agent 1 = 66 → Assign to Agent 1
    - Item 1: Agent 0 = 37, Agent 1 = 79 → Assign to Agent 1
    - Item 2: Agent 0 = 32, Agent 1 = 94 → Assign to Agent 1
    - Item 3: Agent 0 = 26, Agent 1 = 60 → Assign to Agent 1
    - Item 4: Agent 0 = 32, Agent 1 = 8 → Assign to Agent 0
    - Item 5: Agent 0 = 54, Agent 1 = 42 → Assign to Agent 0
    - Item 6: Agent 0 = 26, Agent 1 = 48 → Assign to Agent 1

4. **Check Total Items and Adjust if Necessary**: Ensure each agent has an integer number of items, and all items have been allocated:

    - Agent 0: Items [4, 5]
    - Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 2, 3, 6]

Now, let's present the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and considers the different valuations each agent has for the items.
