Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  93  11  56  21  63  72
1  27  30  85  49  86  26  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider both agents' valuations of each item. The goal is to ensure that neither agent would prefer the other's allocation, based on their valuations, to their own. 

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 56 + 93 + 11 + 56 + 21 + 63 + 72 = 372
- Agent 1's total valuation: 27 + 30 + 85 + 49 + 86 + 26 + 46 = 349

Next, we attempt to allocate the items such that each agent's total valuation for their allocated items is as close to equal as possible. We will prioritize higher valuations to balance the perceived value between agents.

Let's begin by assigning items one by one:

1. **Highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most at 93.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most at 86.

   Assign item 1 to Agent 0 and item 4 to Agent 1.

2. **Next highest valued items:**
   - Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 6 at 72.
   - Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 2 at 85.

   Assign item 6 to Agent 0 and item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Continue balancing their valuations:**
   - Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 5 at 63.
   - Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 3 at 49.

   Assign item 5 to Agent 0 and item 3 to Agent 1.

4. **Remaining items:**
   - Agent 0 has item 0 valued at 56 and item 3 valued at 56.
   - Agent 1 has item 0 valued at 27 and item 6 valued at 46.

   Assign item 0 to Agent 0 and item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Final allocation to even out the number of items:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

Now, both agents have been allocated items in a way that aims for fairness and envy-freeness:

- Agent 0 has items 1, 5, 6, and 0.
- Agent 1 has items 4, 2, and 3.

Checking for envy-freeness:
- Agent 0 has a total valuation of 93 + 63 + 72 + 56 = 284.
- Agent 1 has a total valuation of 86 + 85 + 49 = 220.

This allocation isn't perfectly envy-free, but it attempts to balance the values based on their initial preferences. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6, 0],
    "1": [4, 2, 3]
}
```
