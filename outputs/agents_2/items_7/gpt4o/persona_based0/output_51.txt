Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  86  92  35  24  20  12
1  25  16  41  94  95  83  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that neither agent feels envious of the other, if possible. This involves balancing the total value of the items allocated to each agent based on their individual valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Valuations Overview:**
   - **Agent 0:** Values of items: [84, 86, 92, 35, 24, 20, 12]
   - **Agent 1:** Values of items: [25, 16, 41, 94, 95, 83, 89]

2. **Key Considerations:**
   - The total number of items is 7, so each agent should receive a total of 7 items combined.
   - Aim for an allocation that minimizes envy by attempting to equalize the perceived value of the allocations for each agent.

3. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, and 2.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 3, 4, 5, and 6.

4. **Potential Allocation:**
   - Allocate items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuations for these items.
   - Allocate items 3, 4, 5, and 6 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuations for these items.

5. **Valuation Totals:**
   - **Agent 0's allocation:** Items [0, 1, 2] with valuations [84, 86, 92]. Total value = 84 + 86 + 92 = 262.
   - **Agent 1's allocation:** Items [3, 4, 5, 6] with valuations [94, 95, 83, 89]. Total value = 94 + 95 + 83 + 89 = 361.

6. **Envy Consideration:**
   - While the total values aren't exactly equal, this allocation is likely to be envy-free given that each agent receives the items they value the most.

### Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
