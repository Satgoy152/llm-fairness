Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  76  61  51   9  12  46
1  21  76  97  94  97  89  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents in a way that seeks to minimize envy, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they receive a fair share of their perceived value.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: [39, 76, 61, 51, 9, 12, 46]
- Agent 1: [21, 76, 97, 94, 97, 89, 94]

A potential approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use a method that attempts to balance the total value each agent assigns to their allocated items. One such method involves iteratively assigning the item that provides the most relative value to an agent, while considering the remaining items.

Let's proceed with such an allocation:

1. Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 1 (97) compared to Agent 0 (61). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
2. Item 4 is highly valued by Agent 1 (97) compared to Agent 0 (9). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Item 3 is highly valued by Agent 1 (94) compared to Agent 0 (51). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
4. Item 5 is highly valued by Agent 1 (89) compared to Agent 0 (12). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

Now, Agent 1 has items 2, 3, 4, 5.

5. Item 1 is valued equally by both agents (76), but choosing it for Agent 0 helps balance the distribution. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
6. Item 6 is valued 46 by Agent 0 and 94 by Agent 1. However, allocating more items to Agent 1 would increase imbalance, so assign item 6 to Agent 0.
7. Item 0 is left, with Agent 0 valuing it at 39 and Agent 1 at 21. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 6
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 4, 5

These allocations aim to balance the total perceived value each agent receives, considering the constraints of integer allocations and the total number of items.

{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
