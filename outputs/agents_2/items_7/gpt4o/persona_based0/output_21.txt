Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  70  72  13  83  15  70
1  72  95  72  66  20   3  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or at least minimizes envy to the extent possible, given the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  70  72  13  83  15  70
1  72  95  72  66  20   3  58
```

To achieve envy-freeness, each agent should feel that they have received a bundle of items as valuable as any other bundle they could receive given their valuation. The sum of values for each agent's bundle should ideally be similar to avoid envy. 

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if each received their highest valued items:

Agent 0's highest valued items: 83, 72, 70, 70, 15, 13, 11

Agent 1's highest valued items: 95, 72, 72, 66, 58, 20, 3

To achieve a fair distribution, we can try to balance the total value assigned to each agent.

Let's allocate items:

1. Item 4 has a high value for Agent 0 (83) but is lower for Agent 1 (20). Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
2. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 1 (95) and is also high for Agent 0 (70). Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Item 0 is low value for both agents but slightly higher for Agent 1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
4. Item 2 is equal for both agents (72 each). Assign it to Agent 0 for balance.
5. Item 3 is more valuable to Agent 1 (66) compared to Agent 0 (13). Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
6. Item 5 is negligible for Agent 1 (3) and higher for Agent 0 (15). Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.
7. Item 6 is more valuable to Agent 0 (70) than to Agent 1 (58). Assign Item 6 to Agent 0.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 2, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 0, 3

The approximate total valuations are:

- Agent 0: 83 + 72 + 15 + 70 = 240
- Agent 1: 95 + 72 + 66 = 233

Both agents have received a similar total value based on their preferences, reducing possible envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 0, 3]
}
```
