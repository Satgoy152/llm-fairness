Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  63  62  72  95  66  90
1  25  40  66  85   7  76  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 40 66 85  7 76 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we need to distribute the items in such a way that neither agent believes another agent has been given a better allocation. We will consider the valuations provided in the table and aim to balance the total value each agent perceives in their allocated items.

Let's sum up each agent's total valuation for all items to understand their preferences:

- Agent 0's total valuation = 95 + 63 + 62 + 72 + 95 + 66 + 90 = 543
- Agent 1's total valuation = 25 + 40 + 66 + 85 + 7 + 76 + 78 = 377

Next, we analyze individual valuations to create an envy-free allocation:

1. Sort items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents. The larger the difference, the more strongly an agent prefers an item over the other.

   - Item 0: |95 - 25| = 70
   - Item 1: |63 - 40| = 23
   - Item 2: |62 - 66| = 4
   - Item 3: |72 - 85| = 13
   - Item 4: |95 - 7| = 88
   - Item 5: |66 - 76| = 10
   - Item 6: |90 - 78| = 12

2. Allocate items where the differences are largest to the agent with the higher valuation for those items.

   - Give Item 4 to Agent 0 (95 vs. 7)
   - Give Item 0 to Agent 0 (95 vs. 25)
   - Give Item 6 to Agent 0 (90 vs. 78)
   - Give Item 3 to Agent 1 (72 vs. 85)
   - Give Item 1 to Agent 0 (63 vs. 40)
   - Give Item 5 to Agent 1 (66 vs. 76)
   - Give Item 2 to Agent 1 (62 vs. 66)

By this allocation, we ensure that the items are distributed in a way that minimizes potential envy, by giving preference to the agent who values each item more.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
