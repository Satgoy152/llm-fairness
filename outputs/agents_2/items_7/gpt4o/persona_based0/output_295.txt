Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  21  83  30   7  31  30
1  26  46  38   9  12  68  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

First, let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [86, 21, 83, 30, 7, 31, 30]
- Agent 1: [26, 46, 38, 9, 12, 68, 91]

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. A common approach to achieve fairness is to use the "maximum marginal value" or "highest bidder" strategy, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most.

Let's analyze the preference for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 at 26. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 at 46. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 83, Agent 1 at 38. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 30, Agent 1 at 9. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 7, Agent 1 at 12. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 31, Agent 1 at 68. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 30, Agent 1 at 91. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, given the constraints, and attempts to minimize envy by aligning the allocation with each agent's preferences.
