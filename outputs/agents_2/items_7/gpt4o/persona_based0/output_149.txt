Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  83  64  97  36   6  33
1  22  44  90  45  68  64  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute them in a way that minimizes potential envy. A simple and effective strategy can be to allocate the items by maximizing each agent's total valuation while keeping in mind that each agent should receive a roughly equal share of their total potential value.

Let's calculate the sum of valuations for each agent and then proceed with the allocation:

**Agent 0's Valuations:**
- Items: [0: 94, 1: 83, 2: 64, 3: 97, 4: 36, 5: 6, 6: 33]
- Total Valuation: 94 + 83 + 64 + 97 + 36 + 6 + 33 = 413

**Agent 1's Valuations:**
- Items: [0: 22, 1: 44, 2: 90, 3: 45, 4: 68, 5: 64, 6: 71]
- Total Valuation: 22 + 44 + 90 + 45 + 68 + 64 + 71 = 404

Now, let's proceed with the allocation to ensure fairness and minimize envy:

1. Assign the highest value item for each agent to them if it significantly increases their total valuation more than it would for the other agent.
2. Continue to allocate the remaining items based on maximizing each agent's valuation while aiming for a balanced distribution of total value.

**Allocation Strategy:**
- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (97) and item 0 (94).
- Agent 1 highly values item 2 (90) and item 6 (71).

Following this strategy, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3, 5
  - Total Valuation: 94 + 83 + 97 + 6 = 280
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4, 6
  - Total Valuation: 90 + 68 + 71 = 229

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation received by both agents and ensures that each gets a fair share of their most valued items.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
