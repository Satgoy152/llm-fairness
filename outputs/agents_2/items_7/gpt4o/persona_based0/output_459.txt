Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  43  64  76  78   9  23
1  66  48   3  59  99  10  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66 48  3 59 99 10 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible based on their valuations. Let's examine the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [60, 43, 64, 76, 78, 9, 23]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [66, 48, 3, 59, 99, 10, 52]

Let's perform a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 4:** 
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 99. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   
2. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 76, which is higher than Agent 1's 59. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 64, which is significantly higher than Agent 1's 3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   
4. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 66, which is slightly higher than Agent 0's 60. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   
5. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 48, which is higher than Agent 0’s 43. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   
6. **Item 6:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 52, higher than Agent 0’s 23. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
   
7. **Item 5:**
   - Only item left; allocate it to Agent 0. Both agents value it low, but Agent 1 already has more items with higher value.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 3, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 4, 6

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 6]
}
```
