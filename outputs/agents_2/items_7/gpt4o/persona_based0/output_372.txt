Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  24  86  26  10  30   4
1  85  97  51  21  68  49  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible in terms of total value received by each agent. A common approach to achieve this is by maximizing the total value each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total value each agent receives for different allocations:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Total value: 14 + 24 + 86 + 26 + 10 + 30 + 4 = 194

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Total value: 85 + 97 + 51 + 21 + 68 + 49 + 51 = 422

Given the above valuations, we will proceed with an allocation that attempts to balance the total value received by each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Assign High-Value Items:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 97) because it significantly increases their total value.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 86) because it is the highest value item for Agent 0.

2. **Balancing Remaining Items:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 85) as it adds considerable value.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 68) to further balance the allocation.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 49) due to higher valuation compared to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 26) since Agent 1 has already received high value items.
   - Finally, assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 4) to balance the number of items.

### Resulting Allocation

- **Agent 0:** Items 2, 3, 6
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 1, 4, 5

This allocation balances the total value received by each agent while ensuring all seven items are distributed. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5]
}
```
