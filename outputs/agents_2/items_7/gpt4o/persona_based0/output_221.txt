Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4  40  80  63  77  90  25
1  95  93  62  45  35  54  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that considers the envy-freeness criterion, we strive to allocate items in such a way that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their individual valuations. Let's analyze the given valuations for each agent:

Agent 0's Valuations:
- Item 0: 4
- Item 1: 40
- Item 2: 80
- Item 3: 63
- Item 4: 77
- Item 5: 90
- Item 6: 25

Agent 1's Valuations:
- Item 0: 95
- Item 1: 93
- Item 2: 62
- Item 3: 45
- Item 4: 35
- Item 5: 54
- Item 6: 94

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0 = 4 + 40 + 80 + 63 + 77 + 90 + 25 = 379
- Total value for Agent 1 = 95 + 93 + 62 + 45 + 35 + 54 + 94 = 478

Next, we will allocate the items to each agent by considering how we can maximize each agent's satisfaction while striving to minimize envy:

1. **Allocate Item 5** to Agent 0 because it has the highest value for them (90), and it's relatively lower for Agent 1 (54).
2. **Allocate Item 0** to Agent 1 because it has the highest value for them (95) and the lowest for Agent 0 (4).
3. **Allocate Item 2** to Agent 0 because it has the second-highest value for them (80), and it's lower for Agent 1 (62).
4. **Allocate Item 6** to Agent 1 because it has the second-highest value for them (94), and it's lower for Agent 0 (25).
5. **Allocate Item 4** to Agent 0 because it has a high value for them (77), and it's lower for Agent 1 (35).
6. **Allocate Item 1** to Agent 1 because it has a high value for them (93), and it's lower for Agent 0 (40).
7. **Allocate Item 3** to Agent 0 because it has a significant value for them (63), and it's lower for Agent 1 (45).

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent the items they value most, relative to the other agent's valuations. The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 6]
}
```
