Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  37  20  58  59  52  74
1   9  21  19  60  11  28  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free or nearly envy-free allocation where each agent values their allocation at least as much as the other agent's allocation, if possible. Given the valuations:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 27 | 37 | 20 | 58 | 59 | 52 | 74 |
| 1          | 9  | 21 | 19 | 60 | 11 | 28 | 80 |

Let's begin by examining the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 27 + 37 + 20 + 58 + 59 + 52 + 74 = 327
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 9 + 21 + 19 + 60 + 11 + 28 + 80 = 228

We need to divide the items so that each agent receives a fair share of the total value. Since there are only 2 agents, an equitable distribution would ideally involve each agent receiving a set of items where the total value according to their own valuations is about half of their total valuation.

Let's start by considering items that have high individual valuations for each agent, aiming to distribute these to maximize fairness:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 (74) the highest.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 (80) the highest.

We assign item 6 to Agent 1 since it has the highest value for them.

Next, let's consider items based on Agent 0's preferences:

- Assign item 4 (59) to Agent 0, as it's the second-highest value.
- Assign item 3 (58) to Agent 0, as it's a high value.
- Assign item 5 (52) to Agent 0.

After assigning these items, Agent 0 has items [3, 4, 5] with a total valuation of 169.

Now, let's focus on Agent 1:

- Agent 1 has item 6, valued at 80.
- Assign item 0 (9) to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 (21) to Agent 1.

This leaves item 2, which can be allocated based on remaining values:

- Assign item 2 (19) to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 has items [3, 4, 5] with a total valuation of 169.
- Agent 1 has items [0, 1, 2, 6] with a total valuation of 159.

The division is not perfectly envy-free, but it is a fair distribution based on available methods.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of their total valuations based on the given constraints.
