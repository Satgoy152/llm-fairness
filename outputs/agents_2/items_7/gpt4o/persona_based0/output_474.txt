Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  59  71  82  93  86  22
1  32  37  83  56  81  61  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while minimizing envy, we'll start by calculating the total value each agent has for all items. Then, we'll use these values to aim for an envy-free or envy-minimized allocation.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations
- **Agent 0**'s total valuation: 30 + 59 + 71 + 82 + 93 + 86 + 22 = 443
- **Agent 1**'s total valuation: 32 + 37 + 83 + 56 + 81 + 61 + 57 = 407

### Step 2: Consider Envy-Free Allocation
We want to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received at least half of their total valuation, and ideally, neither would envy the other.

### Step 3: Determine Allocation
1. **Agent 0** prefers items with the highest individual values: 93, 86, 82, etc.
2. **Agent 1** prefers items with the highest individual values: 83, 81, 61, etc.

Using a greedy approach, we can allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Items 4 (93), 5 (86), 3 (82) - Total valuation: 93 + 86 + 82 = 261
- **Agent 1**: Items 2 (83), 6 (57), 1 (37), 0 (32) - Total valuation: 83 + 57 + 37 + 32 = 209

This allocation gives each agent items that they value highly and ensures all 7 items are allocated without exceeding the number of items available.

### Step 4: Present Allocation in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation balances the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed among the agents.
