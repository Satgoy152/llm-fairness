Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  82  98   8  48  11  16
1  89  12  88  39  50  82  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the total valuation each agent has across all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 60 + 82 + 98 + 8 + 48 + 11 + 16 = 323
- Agent 1's total valuation: 89 + 12 + 88 + 39 + 50 + 82 + 59 = 419

Next, we can aim to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. To achieve this, we look for a division that balances high-value items for each agent.

Here is a possible allocation that aims to be fair and envy-free:

- Agent 0 highly values items 2, 1, and 0. 
- Agent 1 highly values items 0, 5, and 2.

We proceed to allocate by comparing the combined values for each agent:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 98 for Agent 0, 88 for Agent 1).
2. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 82 for Agent 1, 11 for Agent 0).
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 89 for Agent 1, 60 for Agent 0).
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 82 for Agent 0, 12 for Agent 1).
5. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (value 59 for Agent 1, 16 for Agent 0).
6. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (value 48 for Agent 0, 50 for Agent 1).
7. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 39 for Agent 1, 8 for Agent 0).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 2, 1, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 5, 0, 6, and 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 4],
    "1": [5, 0, 6, 3]
}
```
