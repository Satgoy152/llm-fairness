Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  74  27  59  88  90  40
1  69  69   9  76  47  62  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels that they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 84 + 74 + 27 + 59 + 88 + 90 + 40 = 462
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 69 + 69 + 9 + 76 + 47 + 62 + 45 = 377

2. **Calculate Share of Total Valuation:**
   - Agent 0's proportion of total valuation: 462 / (462 + 377) ≈ 0.551
   - Agent 1's proportion of total valuation: 377 / (462 + 377) ≈ 0.449

3. **Initial Fair Allocation:**
   - Allocate items to each agent based on their proportional valuation.

4. **Assign Items to Agents:**
   - Compare the valuations each agent has for each item and try to maximize the allocation for each agent in terms of their highest valued items, while keeping the total number of items allocated equal to the number of items available (7).

5. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items to the agents in a manner that minimizes envy:
     - Agent 0 values items in descending order: 5 (90), 4 (88), 0 (84), 1 (74), 3 (59), 6 (40), 2 (27)
     - Agent 1 values items in descending order: 3 (76), 5 (62), 1 (69), 0 (69), 6 (45), 4 (47), 2 (9)
   - Attempt to balance the allocation so each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

6. **Final Fair Allocation:**
   - Allocate items as follows:
     - Agent 0 receives items: 0 (84), 4 (88), 5 (90)
     - Agent 1 receives items: 1 (69), 2 (9), 3 (76), 6 (45)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, balancing their overall satisfaction and minimizing envy.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation respects the requirement that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.
