Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  17  23  89  71  61  73
1  41  70  39  40  12  49  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received their fair share based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their preferences:

- **Agent 0's Total Valuation:**  
  \( 51 + 17 + 23 + 89 + 71 + 61 + 73 = 385 \)

- **Agent 1's Total Valuation:**  
  \( 41 + 70 + 39 + 40 + 12 + 49 + 29 = 280 \)

Next, we can look to allocate the items by comparing the valuations for each item between the two agents. The goal is to ensure that both agents feel they have received a fair share of the total value.

Let's start by listing the items in descending order of value for each agent:

- **Agent 0's Valuations (Descending):**  
  Item 3 (89), Item 6 (73), Item 4 (71), Item 5 (61), Item 0 (51), Item 2 (23), Item 1 (17)

- **Agent 1's Valuations (Descending):**  
  Item 1 (70), Item 5 (49), Item 3 (40), Item 2 (39), Item 0 (41), Item 6 (29), Item 4 (12)

Now, we'll attempt to allocate these items so that each agent receives approximately half of the total value based on their own valuations.

**Proposed Allocation:**

1. **Allocate to Agent 0:**
   - Item 3 (Value 89)
   - Item 4 (Value 71)
   - Item 6 (Value 73)

   Total value for Agent 0: \( 89 + 71 + 73 = 233 \)

2. **Allocate to Agent 1:**
   - Item 0 (Value 41)
   - Item 1 (Value 70)
   - Item 2 (Value 39)
   - Item 5 (Value 49)

   Total value for Agent 1: \( 41 + 70 + 39 + 49 = 199 \)

Now, let's check the total allocation:

- Agent 0's items: 3, 4, 6
- Agent 1's items: 0, 1, 2, 5

This allocation ensures all 7 items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Agent 0 receives items they highly value, while Agent 1 receives a combination of items that maximize their total value given the constraints.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5]
}
```
