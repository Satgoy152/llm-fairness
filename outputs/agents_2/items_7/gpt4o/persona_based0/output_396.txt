Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  85  23  50  42  42  71
1  26  74  73  75  95  72  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve fairness criteria such as envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's bundle of items over their own, given their own valuation of the items.

Let's consider the valuations for each item by the agents:

- Agent 0: [62, 85, 23, 50, 42, 42, 71]
- Agent 1: [26, 74, 73, 75, 95, 72, 80]

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. One common procedure is to allocate items one by one, choosing the highest value for each agent alternatively while ensuring they value their bundle at least as much as the other agent's bundle.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it highest (95) and should receive it.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it highest (85) and should receive it.
3. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it higher than Agent 0 (75 vs. 50) and should receive it.
4. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it higher than Agent 0 (80 vs. 71) and should receive it.
5. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 1 (62 vs. 26) and should receive it.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it higher than Agent 0 (72 vs. 42) and should receive it.
7. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it higher than Agent 0 (73 vs. 23) and should receive it.

Checking the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 0]
    - Total valuation = 85 + 62 = 147

- **Agent 1**: Items [4, 3, 6, 5, 2]
    - Total valuation = 95 + 75 + 80 + 72 + 73 = 395

Agent 0 ends up with fewer items but considers their bundle valuable due to item 1, which they value highly. Agent 1 receives more items, with a total valuation reflecting their preferences.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [4, 3, 6, 5, 2]
}
```
