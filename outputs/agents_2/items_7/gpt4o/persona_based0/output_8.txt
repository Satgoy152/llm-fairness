Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  77  74  71  92  74  87
1  26  79  46  17  18   3  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents, we need to allocate the items such that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible, considering the valuations. In this specific case, with only two agents, we can focus on minimizing the envy by ensuring that each agent values their bundle more than (or at least as much as) they value the other agent's bundle.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**  
   - Agent 0: 55 + 77 + 74 + 71 + 92 + 74 + 87 = 530
   - Agent 1: 26 + 79 + 46 + 17 + 18 + 3 + 49 = 238

2. **Sort Items by Difference in Valuation:**  
   Calculate the difference in valuations between the agents for each item to understand which items are relatively more valuable to each agent:

   - Item 0: 55 (Agent 0) vs. 26 (Agent 1), difference = 29
   - Item 1: 77 vs. 79, difference = -2
   - Item 2: 74 vs. 46, difference = 28
   - Item 3: 71 vs. 17, difference = 54
   - Item 4: 92 vs. 18, difference = 74
   - Item 5: 74 vs. 3, difference = 71
   - Item 6: 87 vs. 49, difference = 38

3. **Allocate Items Based on Differences:**
   - Items that are significantly more valuable to one agent should be allocated to that agent to minimize envy.
   - Items with small differences can be used to balance the total valuation.

4. **Proposed Allocation:**
   - Assign items primarily based on who values them most and balance the overall value perceived by each agent.

   After considering the above, here's a fair allocation:

   - Agent 0: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   - Agent 1: [1, 6]

   **Verification:**

   - Agent 0's total valuation: 55 (Item 0) + 74 (Item 2) + 71 (Item 3) + 92 (Item 4) + 74 (Item 5) = 366
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 79 (Item 1) + 49 (Item 6) = 128

   This allocation aims to distribute the items such that Agent 0 receives items that are significantly more valuable to them, while Agent 1 gets items that they value relatively more or are less envied.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 6]
}
```
