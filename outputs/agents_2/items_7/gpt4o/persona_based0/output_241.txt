Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  60  48  68  53  87  92
1  94  36  92  87  99  29  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [94 36 92 87 99 29 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation while ensuring envy-freeness, if possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's examine each agent's total valuation for all items and attempt to distribute items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible:

Agent 0's valuations: [44, 60, 48, 68, 53, 87, 92]  
Agent 0's total valuation: 44 + 60 + 48 + 68 + 53 + 87 + 92 = 452

Agent 1's valuations: [94, 36, 92, 87, 99, 29, 50]  
Agent 1's total valuation: 94 + 36 + 92 + 87 + 99 + 29 + 50 = 487

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify High-Value Items:**
   - Agent 0 values items 5 and 6 highly (87 and 92).
   - Agent 1 values items 0 and 4 highly (94 and 99).

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate items 5 and 6 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - For the remaining items (1, 2, 3), we need to balance the allocation.
   - Agent 0's next highest valued item is 3 (68).
   - Agent 1's next highest valued item is 2 (92).

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 items with a total valuation of 60 + 68 + 87 + 92 = 307, and Agent 1 items with a total valuation of 94 + 92 + 99 = 285. The allocation aims to be as balanced as possible given the constraints and ensures that each agent receives items they highly value.
