Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  37  27  40  55  35  92
1   1  64  64  68  89  88  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A fair allocation often aims to minimize envy, ensuring that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value the allocation of the other agent. In this context, we will try to maximize the total value each agent perceives from their allocation while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Given the valuations:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 12      | 1       |
| 1    | 37      | 64      |
| 2    | 27      | 64      |
| 3    | 40      | 68      |
| 4    | 55      | 89      |
| 5    | 35      | 88      |
| 6    | 92      | 84      |

We will allocate the items to maximize the value perceived by each agent, aiming for an envy-free division.

### Possible Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Value of 12
   - Item 2: Value of 27
   - Item 6: Value of 92

   Total value for Agent 0 = 12 + 27 + 92 = 131

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 1: Value of 64
   - Item 3: Value of 68
   - Item 4: Value of 89
   - Item 5: Value of 88

   Total value for Agent 1 = 64 + 68 + 89 + 88 = 309

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a set of items, and all items are allocated. Agent 1, who values the items more highly, receives the majority of the higher-valued items according to their valuation.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to be as fair as possible given the constraints and valuations, minimizing envy between the agents.
