Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  69  81  13  46   4  39
1  75  90  49  94  56  97  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, let's follow a systematic approach. The aim is to divide the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuation, and no agent envies the other's allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **List all items and their valuations by agents:**

   - **Agent 0:**
     - Item 0: 46
     - Item 1: 69
     - Item 2: 81
     - Item 3: 13
     - Item 4: 46
     - Item 5: 4
     - Item 6: 39
     
   - **Agent 1:**
     - Item 0: 75
     - Item 1: 90
     - Item 2: 49
     - Item 3: 94
     - Item 4: 56
     - Item 5: 97
     - Item 6: 64

2. **Determine each agent's total valuation sum:**

   - Agent 0: 46 + 69 + 81 + 13 + 46 + 4 + 39 = 298
   - Agent 1: 75 + 90 + 49 + 94 + 56 + 97 + 64 = 525

3. **Allocate items to balance the relative value for each agent:**

   - Start by assigning the highest value items to each agent based on their individual preference.

4. **Proposed Allocation:**

   - **Agent 0:**
     - Allocate items that are relatively more valuable to Agent 0 compared to Agent 1.
     - Assign items: 2, 1, 0 (values 81, 69, 46 for Agent 0)

   - **Agent 1:**
     - Allocate items that are relatively more valuable to Agent 1 compared to Agent 0.
     - Assign items: 3, 5, 4, 6 (values 94, 97, 56, 64 for Agent 1)
     
This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly relative to the other agent, thus minimizing envy.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 0],
    "1": [3, 5, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of their perceived value without envying each other's allocations.
