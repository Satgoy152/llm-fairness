Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  90  43  63   6   2  37
1  60  42  30  61  46  13  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly and ensure envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value from their allocated items while ensuring the total number of items allocated remains as 7. Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [13, 90, 43, 63, 6, 2, 37]
- Agent 1 values: [60, 42, 30, 61, 46, 13, 54]

To achieve a fair division, we can aim to maximize each agent's share of total value.

Let's begin by calculating the total valuation for each agent:

- Total value for Agent 0 = 13 + 90 + 43 + 63 + 6 + 2 + 37 = 254
- Total value for Agent 1 = 60 + 42 + 30 + 61 + 46 + 13 + 54 = 306

Now let's consider the potential allocations:

1. Allocate the highest-valued items to each agent to maximize their total value. We should aim to balance the distribution of total values rather than items themselves.

2. Start by allocating the highest-valued item for Agent 0, which is item 1 (value 90), and then allocate the highest-valued item for Agent 1, which is item 0 (value 60).

3. Continue this process, alternating between agents, while checking the total number of allocated items doesn't exceed 7.

Following this approach, a fair allocation can be:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 6 (values: 90, 63, 37) for a total value of 190
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 4, 5 (values: 60, 30, 46, 13) for a total value of 149

This allocation provides each agent with a balanced share of their total value, and all 7 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
