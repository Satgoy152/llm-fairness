Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  63  87  60  58   9  91
1  83  39  46  11  65  95  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a way that is fair and minimizes envy, we should consider the valuations of each item by both agents. The aim is to ensure that neither agent envies the allocation of the other, which often requires considering both the total value and the number of items each agent receives.

First, let's review the valuations of each item by the agents:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [88, 63, 87, 60, 58, 9, 91]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [83, 39, 46, 11, 65, 95, 38]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the following approach:
1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share of their total valuation.

Total valuations:
- Agent 0: 456
- Agent 1: 377

Optimal allocation would aim to distribute these valuations as evenly as possible. However, given the integer nature of items, we may not perfectly balance these values. We will try to ensure both agents have similar overall satisfaction.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Allocate items that are highly valued by one agent but not the other to minimize potential envy.
2. Ensure each agent gets a mix of items to balance the total value.

### Allocation Steps:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0, 2, and 6.
- Agent 1 highly values items 5 and 4.
- Items 1 and 3 have relatively lower values and can be used to balance the allocations.

Based on this, we can make the following allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 2, 6
- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 3, 4, 5

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items based on the agents' respective valuations while minimizing potential envy. Agent 0 receives items with higher individual valuations according to their perspective, while Agent 1 receives a greater number of items, balancing the total valuations.
