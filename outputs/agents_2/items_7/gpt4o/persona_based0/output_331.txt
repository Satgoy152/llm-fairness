Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69   1  70   2  57  13  28
1  22  99  33  39  35  69  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to create an allocation where no agent envies the other's share, if possible. The goal is to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent places on all the items:

- Agent 0's total value: 69 + 1 + 70 + 2 + 57 + 13 + 28 = 240
- Agent 1's total value: 22 + 99 + 33 + 39 + 35 + 69 + 79 = 376

Now, we'll consider allocating items to maximize each agent's total valuation while trying to balance the allocation:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 69, and Agent 1 values it at 22. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 1, and Agent 1 values it at 99. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 70, and Agent 1 values it at 33. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 2, and Agent 1 values it at 39. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 57, and Agent 1 values it at 35. Allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it at 13, and Agent 1 values it at 69. Allocate to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 0 values it at 28, and Agent 1 values it at 79. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 4
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 69 + 70 + 57 = 196
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 5, 6
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 99 + 39 + 69 + 79 = 286

By these allocations, each agent gets a fair share according to their own valuations. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
