Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  96  90  40  22  63  57
1   0  89  34  88   4  86  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, meaning each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the other agent values their own allocation.

Here are the valuations of the agents for each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: [42, 96, 90, 40, 22, 63, 57]
- Agent 1's valuations: [0, 89, 34, 88, 4, 86, 53]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a simple approach where each agent takes turns picking the item they value the most that is still available. This heuristic doesn't always guarantee envy-freeness, but it often leads to a fair outcome.

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 96).
   - Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 88).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 90).
   - Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 86).

3. **Round 3:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 63) - note: item 5 is already taken, so move to agent's next highest.
   - Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 42).
   - Agent 1 picks item 6 (value 53).

4. **Round 4:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 57) - note: item 6 is already taken, move to agent's next highest.
   - Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 22).

After these picks, we have:

- Items with Agent 0: [1, 2, 0, 4]
- Items with Agent 1: [3, 5, 6]

The total number of items allocated is 7, which satisfies the requirement. Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 0, 4],
    "1": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items with high personal value while keeping the distribution as balanced as possible given the constraints.
