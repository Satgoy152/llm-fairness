Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  39  62  13  26  61  28
1  51   4  30  86  70  96  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[37 39 62 13 26 61 28]
 [51  4 30 86 70 96 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, let's first consider the total valuation each agent has for all items and then attempt to distribute the items to balance these valuations.

The valuation matrix is as follows:
- Agent 0: [37, 39, 62, 13, 26, 61, 28]
- Agent 1: [51, 4, 30, 86, 70, 96, 33]

First, calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:
- Total valuation for Agent 0: 37 + 39 + 62 + 13 + 26 + 61 + 28 = 266
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 51 + 4 + 30 + 86 + 70 + 96 + 33 = 370

Now, try to allocate items such that each agent's allocated items have a total valuation close to half of the combined total valuation (i.e., (266 + 370) / 2 = 318), while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible.

Let's approach this by looking at the differences in valuation for each item and making allocations to minimize the envy between agents:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (51 vs. 37).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (39 vs. 4).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (62 vs. 30).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (86 vs. 13).
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (70 vs. 26).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (96 vs. 61).
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (33 vs. 28).

Allocate items based on the highest differential in each agent's favor until the allocation is balanced:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

This allocation yields:
- Total valuation for Agent 0: 39 (Item 1) + 62 (Item 2) + 28 (Item 6) = 129
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 51 (Item 0) + 86 (Item 3) + 70 (Item 4) + 96 (Item 5) = 303

While this allocation is not perfectly envy-free (as Agent 1 has a higher total valuation), it is a fair division based on the given valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
