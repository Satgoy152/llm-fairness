Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  34   5  24  81  96  85
1  48  86  39  73  54  64  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, it's important to consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations. Here's one such allocation:

### Valuations Table Recap:
- Agent 0's valuations: [0, 34, 5, 24, 81, 96, 85]
- Agent 1's valuations: [48, 86, 39, 73, 54, 64, 51]

### Total Valuation:
- Total valuation for Agent 0: 0 + 34 + 5 + 24 + 81 + 96 + 85 = 325
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 48 + 86 + 39 + 73 + 54 + 64 + 51 = 415

To achieve a fair allocation, we aim to balance the perceived value each agent receives. 

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0 Allocation:**
   - Give Agent 0 items that collectively have high valuation for them but relatively less importance to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 1 Allocation:**
   - Give Agent 1 items that have high valuation for them but relatively lesser importance to Agent 0.

### Fair Allocation:
Based on this strategy, a fair division can be:

- **Agent 0:** Items [1, 4, 5] 
  - Valuation: 34 (item 1) + 81 (item 4) + 96 (item 5) = 211

- **Agent 1:** Items [0, 2, 3, 6]
  - Valuation: 48 (item 0) + 39 (item 2) + 73 (item 3) + 51 (item 6) = 211

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items that they value highly, and both have a total perceived valuation of 211, creating an envy-free allocation.

### Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent receives items such that their total perceived value is balanced, aiming for envy-freeness.
