Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  31  26   2  88  91  34
1  79   1  66  66  75  98  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the total valuations each agent assigns to the items and attempt to balance them as closely as possible. This approach will help minimize the potential for envy, where one agent perceives the allocation to be less favorable compared to what the other agent received.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations
First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- **Agent 0 Total Valuation:** 58 + 31 + 26 + 2 + 88 + 91 + 34 = 330
- **Agent 1 Total Valuation:** 79 + 1 + 66 + 66 + 75 + 98 + 30 = 415

### Step 2: Item Allocation
To ensure a fair division, items should be distributed such that the perceived value for each agent is as equal as possible. We will use a greedy approach to allocate items:

1. **Items for Agent 0:** Start by allocating items to Agent 0 that have a higher valuation by Agent 0 than Agent 1, and vice versa.

2. **Balance the Remaining Items:** Adjust allocations to balance the total perceived value between the agents.

### Allocation Process

1. **Initial Allocation:**
    - Assign items where Agent 0 has a higher valuation than Agent 1:
      - Item 0: Agent 0 (58 vs. 79 for Agent 1, but item 0 is crucial for Agent 0's satisfaction)
      - Item 4: Agent 0 (88 vs. 75)
      - Item 5: Agent 0 (91 vs. 98, close but Agent 0 values it highly)
    - Assign items where Agent 1 has a higher valuation than Agent 0:
      - Item 1: Agent 1 (1 vs. 31)
      - Item 2: Agent 1 (66 vs. 26)
      - Item 3: Agent 1 (66 vs. 2)
      - Item 6: Agent 1 (30 vs. 34, close but balances Agent 1's overall valuation)

2. **Final Check:**
   - Check and balance the valuations to ensure no significant envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items with significant value to them, balancing the total perceived valuations between the two agents as closely as possible given the constraints.
