Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  11  23  12  55  95  26
1  19  36  70  75  63  31  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we will consider the concept of envy-freeness, which is a property of an allocation where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations. 

To achieve this, we can use a simple approach like the "sequential allocation" method, where agents take turns picking their most preferred available item. Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 35
- Item 1: 11
- Item 2: 23
- Item 3: 12
- Item 4: 55
- Item 5: 95
- Item 6: 26

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 19
- Item 1: 36
- Item 2: 70
- Item 3: 75
- Item 4: 63
- Item 5: 31
- Item 6: 76

Let's now allocate the items using a round-robin method where Agent 0 starts, followed by Agent 1, and so on, ensuring that each agent picks their highest valued available item:

1. **Agent 1** picks Item 3 (value 75 for Agent 1).
2. **Agent 0** picks Item 5 (value 95 for Agent 0).
3. **Agent 1** picks Item 6 (value 76 for Agent 1).
4. **Agent 0** picks Item 4 (value 55 for Agent 0).
5. **Agent 1** picks Item 2 (value 70 for Agent 1).
6. **Agent 0** picks Item 0 (value 35 for Agent 0).
7. **Agent 1** picks Item 1 (value 36 for Agent 1).

This ensures that each agent is making the best possible choice given what's remaining, which helps minimize envy.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 0],
    "1": [3, 6, 2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed between the two agents, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
