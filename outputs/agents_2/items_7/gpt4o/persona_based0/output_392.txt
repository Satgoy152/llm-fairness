Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2   0  59  87  13   3  42
1  49  99  66  17  36  69  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 99 66 17 36 69 72]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while striving for envy-freeness, we must consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to maximize the total perceived value for each agent. We'll aim to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [2, 0, 59, 87, 13, 3, 42]
- Agent 1's valuations: [49, 99, 66, 17, 36, 69, 72]

A fair allocation should attempt to balance the total value received by each agent as per their own valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0 highly values item 3 (87) and item 2 (59).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (99), item 6 (72), and item 5 (69).

2. **Initial Allocation Based on High Value**:
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (next high value for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (next high value for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (next high value for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (49 is higher than Agent 0's 2).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (13 is higher than Agent 1's 36).

### Resulting Allocation:

After considering the valuations and ensuring that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 3, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 5, 6

### JSON Format Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent according to their respective valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
