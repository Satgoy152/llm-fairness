Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  53  53  88  85  45  77
1  92  52  78  47  90  43  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution. Envy-freeness means that each agent should value their own allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent. Given there are two agents, we can also consider a near envy-free approach where each agent feels they have gotten a fair share.

First, let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 84 + 53 + 53 + 88 + 85 + 45 + 77 = 485
- Agent 1's total value: 92 + 52 + 78 + 47 + 90 + 43 + 81 = 483

Next, we'll try to distribute the items so that the perceived value is as balanced as possible between the agents.

A potential allocation can be achieved by considering items where each agent has a higher individual valuation relative to the other agent:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (92 vs. 84)
2. Item 1: Both agents value this item closely, but we need to balance the distribution
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (78 vs. 53)
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (88 vs. 47)
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it slightly more (90 vs. 85)
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (45 vs. 43)
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (81 vs. 77)

Based on this assessment, we can allocate as follows to balance the values:

- Agent 0: Item 3, Item 4, Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 0, Item 1, Item 2, Item 6

Total value perceived by each agent with this allocation:
- Agent 0: 88 + 85 + 45 = 218
- Agent 1: 92 + 52 + 78 + 81 = 303

This allocation seems to favor Agent 1. To make it slightly more balanced, we could adjust by swapping some items. Let's try another approach:

- Swap Item 1 from Agent 1 to Agent 0.

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1, Item 3, Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 0, Item 2, Item 4, Item 6

Re-calculated total valuations:
- Agent 0: 53 + 88 + 45 = 186
- Agent 1: 92 + 78 + 90 + 81 = 341

This is more balanced, but still not perfect. Let's try swapping Item 4 from Agent 1 to Agent 0:

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1, Item 3, Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 0, Item 2, Item 5, Item 6

Re-calculated total valuations:
- Agent 0: 53 + 88 + 85 = 226
- Agent 1: 92 + 78 + 43 + 81 = 294

This allocation is more balanced and seems reasonable. The goal is to minimize envy, and this distribution attempts to do so within the constraints.

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 6]
}
```
