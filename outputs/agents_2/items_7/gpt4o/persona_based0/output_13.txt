Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  72  71  98  47  66   1
1  88  20  61  96  17  14  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 72 71 98 47 66  1]
 [88 20 61 96 17 14 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible, we can try to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. 

Given the valuations:

Agent 0: [83, 72, 71, 98, 47, 66, 1]  
Agent 1: [88, 20, 61, 96, 17, 14, 37]

We need to allocate the items to the agents. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**
   - Item 3: 98
   - Item 0: 83
   - Item 2: 71
   - Item 5: 66
   - Total: 318

2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**
   - Item 1: 20
   - Item 4: 17
   - Item 6: 37
   - Total: 74

This allocation gives agent 0 a higher total valuation, but considering the large disparity in valuations for certain items, this allocation minimizes potential envy by giving Agent 1 the items they value least, therefore reducing the likelihood of envy.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6]
}
```
