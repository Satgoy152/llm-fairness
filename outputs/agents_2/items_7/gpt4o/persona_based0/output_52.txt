Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69   0  88  19  97  83  84
1  72  71  72  40   7  30  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to allocate all 7 items in a way that each agent values their allocation as much as possible, relative to the other agent's allocation.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and attempt to allocate items in a way that is as envy-free as possible:

- Agent 0's valuations: [69, 0, 88, 19, 97, 83, 84]. Total = 69 + 0 + 88 + 19 + 97 + 83 + 84 = 440.
- Agent 1's valuations: [72, 71, 72, 40, 7, 30, 23]. Total = 72 + 71 + 72 + 40 + 7 + 30 + 23 = 315.

Since the total valuation of items by Agent 0 is higher, we should aim to allocate items in a way that balances the perceived worth between the agents. Let's try to allocate items with the goal of minimizing envy:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0. (Agent 0 values it at 97, and Agent 1 values it at 7).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1. (Agent 1 values it at 72, and Agent 0 values it at 69).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0. (Agent 0 values it at 88, and Agent 1 values it at 72).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 1. (Agent 1 values it at 71, and Agent 0 values it at 0).
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 0. (Agent 0 values it at 83, and Agent 1 values it at 30).
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 1. (Agent 1 values it at 40, and Agent 0 values it at 19).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 0. (Agent 0 values it at 84, and Agent 1 values it at 23).

Allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, and 3.

This allocation aims to balance the distribution based on the agents' valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
