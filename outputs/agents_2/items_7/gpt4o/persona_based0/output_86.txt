Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  30  82  73   4  71  82
1  49  49  58  26  40  73  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider each agent's valuations and try to balance the total value of items allocated to each agent.

Let's begin by calculating the total valuation of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(16 + 30 + 82 + 73 + 4 + 71 + 82 = 358\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(49 + 49 + 58 + 26 + 40 + 73 + 94 = 389\)

To achieve a fair division, we aim to allocate items such that the total valuation perceived by each agent is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items with higher value for Agent 0: 2 (82), 3 (73), 6 (82)
   - Allocate items 2 and 6 to Agent 0. 
   - Remaining items for consideration: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0. 

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items with higher value for Agent 1: 0 (49), 5 (73), 1 (49), 4 (40)
   - Allocate items 0, 1, 4, and 5 to Agent 1.

### Total Value after Allocation:

- **Agent 0's allocation:** Items 2, 6, 3
  - Total value for Agent 0: \(82 + 82 + 73 = 237\)

- **Agent 1's allocation:** Items 0, 1, 4, 5
  - Total value for Agent 1: \(49 + 49 + 40 + 73 = 211\)

This allocation ensures that both agents receive an approximately balanced share of their perceived value from the items, considering the constraints of integer allocation.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5]
}
```
