Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  16  73  36  14  42  95
1  65  81  35  13  58  45  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division where envy-freeness is considered, we want to allocate items such that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, minimizing the possibility for envy. Envy-freeness is a challenging criterion to achieve completely, especially with indivisible goods, but we can aim for a reasonable allocation based on maximizing total valuations for each agent given their preferences.

Let's break down the valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0's Valuations:**
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 16
  - Item 2: 73
  - Item 3: 36
  - Item 4: 14
  - Item 5: 42
  - Item 6: 95

- **Agent 1's Valuations:**
  - Item 0: 65
  - Item 1: 81
  - Item 2: 35
  - Item 3: 13
  - Item 4: 58
  - Item 5: 45
  - Item 6: 38

To proceed, we can use the following strategy:
1. Assign each agent the items that they value the most, ensuring that all items are allocated.
2. Try to balance the total valuation of the items allocated to each agent to ensure fairness.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has highest valuations for items 6, 0, and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has highest valuations for items 1, 4, and 5.

Based on this, we can start by allocating these high-value items to each agent. We must keep track of remaining items and make sure each agent receives a total allocation that is as balanced as possible.

#### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2, 6] (valuations: 90, 73, 95)
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 4, 5] (valuations: 81, 58, 45)

Remaining item to allocate is item 3. Given that Agent 0 already has a higher total valuation than Agent 1 (258 vs. 184), it would be fairer to allocate item 3 to Agent 1 to balance the total valuation:

- **Agent 1**: Additionally gets item 3 (valuations: 13)

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2, 6] (total valuation: 258)
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 4, 5, 3] (total valuation: 197)

While perfect envy-freeness might not be achieved due to the indivisibility of items, this allocation attempts to make the distribution fair based on the given valuations.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to minimize envy by aligning the total valuation of the items received with each agent's preferences as much as possible.
