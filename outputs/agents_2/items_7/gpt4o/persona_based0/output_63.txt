Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  13  89  52  57  40  69
1  83  63  27  51  71  99  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can employ a strategic approach. The goal is to maximize each agent's perceived value of the items they receive, while trying to balance the total perceived values to avoid envy.

Let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items and then proceed to find an allocation that attempts to equalize these values as much as possible:

Agent 0's total valuation:  
60 + 13 + 89 + 52 + 57 + 40 + 69 = 380

Agent 1's total valuation:  
83 + 63 + 27 + 51 + 71 + 99 + 30 = 424

The difference in total valuation is 424 - 380 = 44, indicating that Agent 1 values the items collectively more than Agent 0. To balance this, we can start by assigning items that each agent values highly.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Assign to Agent 0**: Give Agent 0 the items they value the most:
   - Item 2 (value 89)
   - Item 6 (value 69)
   - Item 0 (value 60)

2. **Assign to Agent 1**: Give Agent 1 the items they value the most:
   - Item 5 (value 99)
   - Item 4 (value 71)
   - Item 1 (value 63)

Now, we have one item left to allocate, which is Item 3. Let's assign it by considering the remaining valuations for this item:
- Agent 0 values Item 3 at 52.
- Agent 1 values Item 3 at 51.

Item 3 is nearly equally valued by both agents, but assigning it to Agent 0 will help balance the perceived allocations better since Agent 1 already has items with higher total value.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 5

Let's summarize our allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value for each agent, considering their individual item valuations.
