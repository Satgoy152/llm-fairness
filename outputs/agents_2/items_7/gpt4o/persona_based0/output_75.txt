Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0  1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  5  18  30  79  51  36
1  26  7   7  65  23  79  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26  7  7 65 23 79 22]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we need to consider both efficiency and fairness. A common approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

First, let's calculate the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 27 + 5 + 18 + 30 + 79 + 51 + 36 = 246
- Agent 1's total valuation: 26 + 7 + 7 + 65 + 23 + 79 + 22 = 229

Now, let's try to allocate items to minimize envy. We can assign items based on maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring the allocation remains envy-free.

1. **Assign items based on highest valuation differences:**

   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 79, and Agent 1 values it at 23. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 79, and Agent 0 values it at 51. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 65, and Agent 0 values it at 30. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 27, and Agent 1 values it at 26. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 36, and Agent 1 values it at 22. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 5, and Agent 1 values it at 7. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 18, and Agent 1 values it at 7. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Final allocation:**

   - Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 4, 6]
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and no agent envies the other.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
