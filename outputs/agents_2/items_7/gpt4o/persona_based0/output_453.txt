Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  63  13  97  42  88  93
1  94   2  32  56  53  60  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we first need to consider the total value each agent assigns to all items and how we can distribute these items so that each agent feels that they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

**Agent 0's valuations:**

- Item 0: 89
- Item 1: 63
- Item 2: 13
- Item 3: 97
- Item 4: 42
- Item 5: 88
- Item 6: 93

Total value for Agent 0 = 89 + 63 + 13 + 97 + 42 + 88 + 93 = 485

**Agent 1's valuations:**

- Item 0: 94
- Item 1: 2
- Item 2: 32
- Item 3: 56
- Item 4: 53
- Item 5: 60
- Item 6: 86

Total value for Agent 1 = 94 + 2 + 32 + 56 + 53 + 60 + 86 = 383

To fairly allocate the items, we aim to balance the perceived value each agent receives. A straightforward method is to focus on allocating items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that the overall allocation is as balanced as possible.

Following this approach, here's a possible allocation:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it more).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it significantly more).
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it more).
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it significantly more).
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it more).
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it significantly more).
- Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it slightly less, but to balance the total value).

Based on these considerations, here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while ensuring all items are allocated. Agent 0 receives items with higher individual values that they appreciate, while Agent 1 receives a balanced set of items to maximize their perceived total value.
