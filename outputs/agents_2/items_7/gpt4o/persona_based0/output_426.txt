Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  44  44  34  76  17  86
1  48  31  54  26  74  21  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share. We'll use a simple approach to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's start by summing up the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation across all items: 
  \(23 + 44 + 44 + 34 + 76 + 17 + 86 = 324\)

- Agent 1's total valuation across all items: 
  \(48 + 31 + 54 + 26 + 74 + 21 + 31 = 285\)

The goal is to allocate items such that both agents perceive the value of their allocated items to be relatively balanced based on their individual valuations.

### Steps to Allocate Items:
1. **Initial Allocation**: Allocate the items to the agent who values it more to minimize envy.
2. **Balancing**: If one agent ends up with significantly more items or value, swap items to balance the perceived value.

### Allocation Process:

1. Compare each item's valuation between the two agents and allocate it to the agent who values it more:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values more (48 vs. 23)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values more (44 vs. 31)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values more (54 vs. 44)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values more (34 vs. 26)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values more (76 vs. 74)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values more (21 vs. 17)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values more (86 vs. 31)

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 4, 6]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 5]

3. **Re-evaluate Balancing:**
   - Total value for Agent 0: \(44 + 34 + 76 + 86 = 240\)
   - Total value for Agent 1: \(48 + 54 + 21 = 123\)
   - Clearly, Agent 0 has significantly more value. We need to adjust for fairness.

4. **Swap Items to Balance:**
   - Swap item 4 (value for agent 0: 76, value for agent 1: 74) from Agent 0 to Agent 1 for item 2 (value for agent 0: 44, value for agent 1: 54).

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 3, 6]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 4, 5]

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the value each agent perceives they receive, minimizing envy based on their individual valuations.
