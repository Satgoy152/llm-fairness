Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  30   9  74  69  46  21
1  76  13  96  28  75  47  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and attempt to distribute them in a way that aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [82, 30, 9, 74, 69, 46, 21]
- Agent 1's valuations: [76, 13, 96, 28, 75, 47, 21]

First, let's calculate the total value each agent perceives for all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 82 + 30 + 9 + 74 + 69 + 46 + 21 = 331
- Total value for Agent 1: 76 + 13 + 96 + 28 + 75 + 47 + 21 = 356

Next, we attempt to allocate the items to balance the value as closely as possible while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Initial allocation strategy:
1. Allocate items that maximize value for each agent without causing significant envy.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: Value 82
  - Item 3: Value 74
  - Item 4: Value 69

- Agent 1:
  - Item 1: Value 13
  - Item 2: Value 96
  - Item 5: Value 47
  - Item 6: Value 21

Now, let's recalculate the total value each agent receives:

- Total value for Agent 0: 82 (Item 0) + 74 (Item 3) + 69 (Item 4) = 225
- Total value for Agent 1: 13 (Item 1) + 96 (Item 2) + 47 (Item 5) + 21 (Item 6) = 177

After evaluating the allocations, this division attempts to balance the perceived value while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 6]
}
```
