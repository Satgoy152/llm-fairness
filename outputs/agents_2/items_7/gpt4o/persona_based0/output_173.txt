Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  62  55   4   0  13  35
1  76  49  70  38  24  75  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents based on their valuations while trying to achieve envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent derives from the items they receive. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Identify Item Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [87, 62, 55, 4, 0, 13, 35]
   - Agent 1: [76, 49, 70, 38, 24, 75, 48]

2. **Determine Initial Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (87), followed by item 1 (62), item 2 (55), and so on.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most (75), followed by item 2 (70), item 0 (76), and so on.

3. **Allocate Items to Maximize Satisfaction:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 87 vs 76 for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 62 vs 49 for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 70 vs 55 for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 38 vs 4 for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 24 vs 0 for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 75 vs 13 for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value 35 vs 48 for Agent 1).

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 6.
   - Agent 1 receives items 2, 3, 4, and 5.

5. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated:**
   - Verify that each item is allocated to one agent, and all 7 items are allocated.

The allocation achieves a balance where each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their individual satisfaction based on their respective valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
