Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  64  86  23  61  32  33
1  70  49  89  84  50  73  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we will aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as any bundle allocated to the other agent.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 86 + 64 + 86 + 23 + 61 + 32 + 33 = 385
- Agent 1: 70 + 49 + 89 + 84 + 50 + 73 + 91 = 506

Next, we will try to allocate the items in such a way that each agent values their allocation highly and ideally, there is no envy.

We will aim to balance the total valuations each agent receives from their allocated items.

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 1** values item 6 the highest (91) and no item has a comparable value for Agent 0, so item 6 will be allocated to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values items 0 and 2 the highest (86 each), and these items are less valuable to Agent 1 (70 and 89, respectively). So, items 0 and 2 will be allocated to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (84), which is not as valuable to Agent 0 (23). Thus, item 3 goes to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** values item 1 at 64, which is more than the value Agent 1 places on it (49). Hence, item 1 will be allocated to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 1** values item 5 at 73, which is more than the value Agent 0 places on it (32). Therefore, item 5 will be allocated to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 0** will take item 4 because it values it at 61, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation (50).

This gives us the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 3, 5, 6

### Verification

- Total value for Agent 0: 86 + 64 + 86 + 61 = 297
- Total value for Agent 1: 84 + 73 + 91 = 248

Agent 0 and Agent 1 have approximately similar valuations in their final allocation, ensuring a fair distribution of items.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
