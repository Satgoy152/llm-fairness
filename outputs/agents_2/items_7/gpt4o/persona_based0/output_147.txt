Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  55  87  73  62  58  62
1  40  66  36  33  95   8  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent values their own bundle at least as much as the other agent's bundle. One common method to achieve this is to maximize the minimum utility each agent receives.

Let's analyze the agents' preferences:

- **Agent 0's valuations:** [33, 55, 87, 73, 62, 58, 62]
- **Agent 1's valuations:** [40, 66, 36, 33, 95, 8, 37]

The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

**Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**
- Total valuation for Agent 0: 33 + 55 + 87 + 73 + 62 + 58 + 62 = 430
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 40 + 66 + 36 + 33 + 95 + 8 + 37 = 315

**Step 2: Allocation Strategy**

To make the division as fair as possible, we can try to balance the distribution by alternating allocations based on preference and overall value balance:

- **Agent 0 (Preference):** Items with highest values: 2 (87), 3 (73), 4 (62)
- **Agent 1 (Preference):** Items with highest values: 4 (95), 1 (66), 0 (40)

Based on the preferences and aiming for fairness, we can allocate as follows:

1. **Give Agent 0 higher-value items according to preference:**
   - Item 2 (87) and Item 3 (73)

2. **Give Agent 1 their highest-value items:**
   - Item 4 (95) and Item 1 (66)

3. **Distribute remaining items to balance value:**
   - Give Agent 0 Item 5 (58) and Item 6 (62)
   - Give Agent 1 Item 0 (40)

**Step 3: Verify Fairness**

After allocation:

- **Agent 0's total valuation for their items:** 87 (Item 2) + 73 (Item 3) + 58 (Item 5) + 62 (Item 6) = 280
- **Agent 1's total valuation for their items:** 95 (Item 4) + 66 (Item 1) + 40 (Item 0) = 201

The allocations ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences and valuations, minimizing envy. While not perfectly balanced in total value, each agent receives items that they individually value highly.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the two agents while taking into account their individual preferences.
