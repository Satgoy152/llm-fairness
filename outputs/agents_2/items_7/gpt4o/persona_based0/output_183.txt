Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  44  41  15  87  39  98
1  20  36  84  66  27  92  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents given their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the utilitarian social welfare, which aims to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring fair distribution.

Let's summarize the total valuation for each possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0's total valuation**:
   - Item 0: 87
   - Item 1: 44
   - Item 2: 41
   - Item 3: 15
   - Item 4: 87
   - Item 5: 39
   - Item 6: 98

2. **Agent 1's total valuation**:
   - Item 0: 20
   - Item 1: 36
   - Item 2: 84
   - Item 3: 66
   - Item 4: 27
   - Item 5: 92
   - Item 6: 22

To maximize the total valuation, we can consider allocating items based on the relative value an agent assigns to each item compared to the other agent. We aim to assign each item to the agent who values it more.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 values it at 20. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 44, Agent 1 values it at 36. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 values it at 84. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 values it at 66. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 values it at 27. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 values it at 92. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 values it at 22. Assign to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 5

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it more, thereby maximizing the total valuation and ensuring a fair division considering the given values.

{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
