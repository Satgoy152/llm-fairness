Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0  1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  1  55  26  72  30   2
1  46  5  22  99  48  38  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we will use the following approach:

1. **Envy-Freeness**: Each agent should receive a bundle of items such that they value their own bundle at least as highly as they value any other agent's bundle. This is known as the envy-freeness criterion.

2. **Max-Min Fairness**: We aim to maximize the minimum value each agent receives. This ensures that the allocation is as fair as possible.

The valuations for the agents are as follows:

- Agent 0: [37, 1, 55, 26, 72, 30, 2]
- Agent 1: [46, 5, 22, 99, 48, 38, 15]

Let's break down the allocation process:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (72), followed by item 2 (55).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (99), followed by item 0 (46).

Given these valuations, let's find an allocation where both agents feel they have a fair share.

**Allocation Process**

1. **Assign high-value items**: Start by assigning items based on each agent's highest valuation to ensure they receive a fair share from their perspective.

2. **Balance the remaining items**: Allocate the remaining items to maximize the minimum valuation of items each agent receives.

- Agent 0 receives item 4 (72) and item 2 (55).
- Agent 1 receives item 3 (99) and item 0 (46).
- Allocate the remaining items [1, 5, 6] to balance the total value for each agent.

**Calculating Remaining Allocations**

- Remaining items: [1, 5, 6]
- Remaining valuations for Agent 0: [1, 30, 2]
- Remaining valuations for Agent 1: [5, 38, 15]

Allocate to balance the total value:

- Agent 0 receives item 5 (30) and item 6 (2).
- Agent 1 receives item 1 (5).

**Final Allocation**

Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 7.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with a reasonable share based on their valuations while ensuring envy-freeness and maximizing fairness.
