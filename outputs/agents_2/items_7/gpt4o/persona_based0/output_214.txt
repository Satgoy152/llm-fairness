Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56   3   3  51  84  60  44
1  83  97  43  93  18  47  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[56  3  3 51 84 60 44]
 [83 97 43 93 18 47 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, which helps achieve a form of envy-freeness. Let's look at the given valuations:

Agent 0: [56, 3, 3, 51, 84, 60, 44]  
Agent 1: [83, 97, 43, 93, 18, 47, 90]

First, let's calculate the total value each item has for both agents to understand which items are more contentious and valuable overall:

- Item 0: 56 (Agent 0) + 83 (Agent 1) = 139
- Item 1: 3 (Agent 0) + 97 (Agent 1) = 100
- Item 2: 3 (Agent 0) + 43 (Agent 1) = 46
- Item 3: 51 (Agent 0) + 93 (Agent 1) = 144
- Item 4: 84 (Agent 0) + 18 (Agent 1) = 102
- Item 5: 60 (Agent 0) + 47 (Agent 1) = 107
- Item 6: 44 (Agent 0) + 90 (Agent 1) = 134

Now, let's try to allocate these items to balance the perceived value each agent receives:

1. Assign the most contentious items to the agent who values them more to maximize fairness.

- Item 1 should go to Agent 1 who values it more (97 vs. 3).
- Item 2 should go to Agent 1 who values it more (43 vs. 3).
- Item 3 should go to Agent 1 who values it more (93 vs. 51).
- Item 0 should go to Agent 0 who values it more (56 vs. 83).

2. Balance the rest to achieve a fair distribution:

- Item 4 should go to Agent 0 who values it more (84 vs. 18).
- Item 5 should go to Agent 0 who values it more (60 vs. 47).
- Item 6 should go to Agent 1 who values it more (90 vs. 44).

This allocation gives us:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3, 6

Let's verify the total valuation each agent receives:

- Agent 0: 56 + 84 + 60 = 200
- Agent 1: 97 + 43 + 93 + 90 = 323

This allocation, while not exactly equal in total numerical value, ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, which typically results in a perception of fairness. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
