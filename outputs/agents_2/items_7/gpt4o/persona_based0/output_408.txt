Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  15  44  42  46  57  56
1  49  46  60  12  59   6  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve a distribution where each agent feels they are receiving a fair share of the total value, according to their own valuations, while also ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's first calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- For Agent 0:
  - Total value = 25 + 15 + 44 + 42 + 46 + 57 + 56 = 285

- For Agent 1:
  - Total value = 49 + 46 + 60 + 12 + 59 + 6 + 13 = 245

Next, we will try to allocate the items such that both agents are satisfied with the items they receive. We should aim for each agent to receive items where the total value is as close as possible to half of their total value, which would be approximately:

- For Agent 0: 285 / 2 = 142.5
- For Agent 1: 245 / 2 = 122.5

Let's proceed with assigning items based on maximizing the value for each agent while avoiding envy:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 60 for Agent 1, value 44 for Agent 0)
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 59 for Agent 1, value 46 for Agent 0)
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 57 for Agent 0, value 6 for Agent 1)
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 56 for Agent 0, value 13 for Agent 1)
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 49 for Agent 1, value 25 for Agent 0)
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 42 for Agent 0, value 12 for Agent 1)
7. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 15 for Agent 0, value 46 for Agent 1)

After this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 3, 5, and 6, with a total value of 170.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, and 4, with a total value of 115.

These allocations aim to balance the total value received by each agent relative to their valuation, while also seeking to distribute items such that envy is minimized.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
