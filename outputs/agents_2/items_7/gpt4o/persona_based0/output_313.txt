Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  75  76  38  76  10  25
1  26  14  37   7  59  92  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation, if possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 45 + 75 + 76 + 38 + 76 + 10 + 25 = 345
- Agent 1: 26 + 14 + 37 + 7 + 59 + 92 + 27 = 262

Now, we'll attempt to allocate items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation. We can use a method that tries to maximize each agent's value while keeping the distribution fair.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Highest Valued Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 76.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 92.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Remove item 2 from Agent 0's list and item 5 from Agent 1's list.

4. **Next Highest Values:**
   - Agent 0's next highest value is item 4 at 76.
   - Agent 1's next highest value is item 4 at 59. However, Agent 0 values item 4 higher, so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

5. **Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0: 45 (item 0), 75 (item 1), 38 (item 3), 10 (item 5), 25 (item 6).
   - Agent 1: 26 (item 0), 14 (item 1), 37 (item 2), 7 (item 3), 27 (item 6).

6. **Further Allocations:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value of 75).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value of 26).

7. **Final Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: 38 (item 3), 10 (item 5), 25 (item 6).
   - Agent 1: 7 (item 3), 27 (item 6).

8. **Complete Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value of 38).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (value of 27).

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 5, and 6.

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with a fair share based on their respective valuations.

### JSON Format Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are assigned and attempts to balance the allocation based on the preferences of both agents.
