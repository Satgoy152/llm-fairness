Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  71  86  61  17  83  65
1   6  10  25   9  65   1  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider their valuations for each item. The objective is to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation and minimize envy, where envy means feeling that another agent has received a more valuable allocation.

Here's the table of valuations for reference:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  71  86  61  17  83  65
1   6  10  25   9  65   1  19
```

Let's analyze the situation:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 2 (86), 5 (83), 1 (71), and 6 (65).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 4 (65) but has much lower valuations for other items.

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should try to allocate high-value items in such a way that both agents feel satisfied with their share.

A potential strategy is:

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as it represents their highest valuation.
- Allocate items 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6 to Agent 0, as they represent their highest valuations.
- Allocate items 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 0's valuation for item 3 is not among their highest, and it will help balance the allocation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that both agents are satisfied with their respective items, thereby minimizing envy and ensuring a fair division based on their preferences.
