Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53   5  83  66  85  78  67
1  44  71   7  30  13  25   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the valuations. A good approach is to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their own bundle and minimize potential envy towards the other agent's bundle.

Let's look at each agent's preferences:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, 4, 5, and 3.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1, 3, and some preference for item 5.

To allocate the items, we should try to give each agent the items they value most while ensuring a fair distribution.

### Allocation Plan:

1. **Allocate high-value items to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 highly.
   - Agent 1 values items 1, 3, and 5 highly.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Give Agent 0 the items with the highest personal value: 0, 2, 4.
   - Give Agent 1 the items with the highest personal value: 1, 3.

3. **Distribute remaining items:**
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1, so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Neither agent values this highly, but Agent 0 has more items already. Allocate to Agent 1 to balance the count of items.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent a bundle they value highly while ensuring that all items are distributed.
