Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  83  36  84  90  95  21
1  85  62  96  16  99  81  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that is envy-free, meaning each agent prefers their own allocation to the other's. A common approach is to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, ensuring a fairer distribution based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step process to allocate the items:

1. **List the items with both agents' valuations:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 at 85.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 83, Agent 1 at 62.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 at 96.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 at 16.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 at 99.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 at 81.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 at 49.

2. **Initial allocation based on highest valuations:**

   - Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 4, 5 (valuations: 83, 84, 90, 95)
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 6 (valuations: 85, 96, 49)

3. **Calculate total valuation for each agent in this allocation:**

   - Agent 0: 83 + 84 + 90 + 95 = 352
   - Agent 1: 85 + 96 + 49 = 230

4. **Adjust to balance the total valuations:**

   To balance the allocation, we can try exchanging the items to close the gap in total valuations. Let's consider moving items around while ensuring each agent still prefers their allocation.

5. **Final allocation adjustment:**

   - Swap item 1 (valued at 83 for Agent 0 and 62 for Agent 1) with item 2 (valued at 36 for Agent 0 and 96 for Agent 1) between the agents.

6. **Recalculate total valuations:**

   - Agent 0: Items 3, 4, 5, 2 (valuations: 84, 90, 95, 36) = 305
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 6 (valuations: 85, 62, 49) = 296

The above allocation seems more balanced and close to fair, minimizing envy between agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5, 2],
    "1": [0, 1, 6]
}
```
