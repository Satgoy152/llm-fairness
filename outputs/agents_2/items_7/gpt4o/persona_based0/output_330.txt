Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0  1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  0  38  24  25  72  95
1  49  6  44  73  53  65  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to maximize the utility for each agent such that neither agent envies the other for their allocation. Here's a step-by-step approach towards achieving this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Compute the total value each agent assigns to all items.
   - Agent 0 total valuation: 98 + 0 + 38 + 24 + 25 + 72 + 95 = 352
   - Agent 1 total valuation: 49 + 6 + 44 + 73 + 53 + 65 + 96 = 386

2. **Initial Allocation by Highest Value**: Start by allocating items based on the highest value an agent assigns to each item.

3. **Allocation**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 at 49. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 at 6. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 38, Agent 1 at 44. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 at 73. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 at 53. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 at 65. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 at 96. Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Final Allocations**:
   - Agent 0 receives items: 0, 5
   - Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6

5. **Validation**:
   - Agent 0's total value: 98 (item 0) + 72 (item 5) = 170
   - Agent 1's total value: 6 (item 1) + 44 (item 2) + 73 (item 3) + 53 (item 4) + 96 (item 6) = 272

Both agents have received a fair portion of the total value based on their individual valuations, balancing the allocation considering each agent's preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
