Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  64  22  32  93  14  74
1  80  90   7  77  41  32  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [80 90  7 77 41 32 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that attempts to minimize envy, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a satisfactory share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [35, 64, 22, 32, 93, 14, 74]
- Agent 1's valuations: [80, 90, 7, 77, 41, 32, 46]

A common approach in such fair division problems is to try to maximize the minimum satisfaction of each agent or to minimize the maximum envy. While complete envy-freeness might not be possible due to the discrete nature of item allocation, we can try to approximate it.

Let's proceed with an allocation:

1. **Assign items based on highest individual valuation differences:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it higher (80 vs. 35), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it higher (90 vs. 64), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it higher (22 vs. 7), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it higher (77 vs. 32), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it higher (93 vs. 41), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it higher (32 vs. 14), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it higher (74 vs. 46), assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [2, 4, 6]
- Agent 1 receives items: [0, 1, 3, 5]

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives, given their preferences.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 5]
}
```
