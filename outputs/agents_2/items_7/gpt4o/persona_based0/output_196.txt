Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  16  82  60  21  37  61
1  96  89  70  78  49  19  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair and envy-free. The goal is to maximize each agent's total valuation for their received items while keeping the distribution as balanced as possible.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 3 + 16 + 82 + 60 + 21 + 37 + 61 = 280
- Agent 1's total valuation: 96 + 89 + 70 + 78 + 49 + 19 + 88 = 489

Next, we'll consider some potential allocations to ensure that each agent gets a satisfactory share of the total value:

1. Agent 0 could be given items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring fairness.
2. Agent 1 should receive items that maximize their total valuation without causing envy.

To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation, let's allocate the items by comparing the relative valuations of each item:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it significantly more than Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it significantly more than Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0.

Considering the above, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, 3, 4, and 6.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, maximizing their satisfaction and maintaining fairness.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
