Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  97  16  70  19  68  62
1  93  34  83  52  30  20  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the total value each agent attributes to all items.
2. Try to allocate items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is maximized while minimizing envy.

Let's compute the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 55 + 97 + 16 + 70 + 19 + 68 + 62 = 387
- Agent 1: 93 + 34 + 83 + 52 + 30 + 20 + 42 = 354

Given that each agent values items differently, we should aim to allocate items such that the sum of values each agent receives is approximately proportional to their total valuation.

Next, let's try to allocate items to balance these valuations:

1. Start with the highest valued items for each agent and allocate them accordingly.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure all items are distributed.

### Allocation:

- Agent 0 has a particularly high valuation for item 1 (97) and item 3 (70).
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0 (93) and item 2 (83).

#### Initial Allocation:
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

#### Follow-up Allocation:
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (since it's the next highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (since it's the next highest value for Agent 1).

#### Remaining Items:
- Items 4, 5, and 6 need to be distributed.

#### Finalize Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 5 (68) and item 6 (62).
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (30).

### Resulting Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations, and no items are left unallocated. This approach tries to balance the perceived value each agent receives by considering their individual valuations of each item.
