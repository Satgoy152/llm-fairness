Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19   2  66  11  67  66  48
1  49  28  33  24  48  71  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[19  2 66 11 67 66 48]
 [49 28 33 24 48 71 97]]
Output:
In the context of fair division and envy-freeness, we aim to allocate items among agents such that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent given their own valuations. To achieve this, we can use an approximate algorithm like the maximum marginal utility approach, where we iteratively allocate items to the agent who values them the most and has not yet reached an equal share.

Given the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0: [19, 2, 66, 11, 67, 66, 48]
- Agent 1: [49, 28, 33, 24, 48, 71, 97]

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 97, the highest among all items, so allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 67, next highest, so allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 71, higher than Agent 0's 66, so allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 66, higher than Agent 1's 33, so allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 49, higher than Agent 0's 19, so allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 24, higher than Agent 0's 11, so allocate to Agent 1.
7. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 28, higher than Agent 0's 2, so allocate to Agent 1.

After this allocation, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their highest valuations, aiming to minimize envy.
