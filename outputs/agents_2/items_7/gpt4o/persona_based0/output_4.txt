Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  47  56  55  97  18  92
1  47  32  12  38  46  24  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's perceived value of their allocation. The goal is to allocate the items such that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation based on their valuations.

Let's compute the total value each agent perceives for all items:
- Agent 0's total valuation: 0 + 47 + 56 + 55 + 97 + 18 + 92 = 365
- Agent 1's total valuation: 47 + 32 + 12 + 38 + 46 + 24 + 32 = 231

We aim to allocate the items such that the total perceived value for each agent is as equal as possible.

### Allocation Process:
1. **Sort items by the difference in valuation between the two agents** to see which items are more valuable to one agent over the other:
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 at 46 (difference = 51)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 at 32 (difference = 60)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 at 38 (difference = 17)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 18, Agent 1 at 24 (difference = -6)
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 at 47 (difference = -47)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 at 32 (difference = 15)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 at 12 (difference = 44)

2. **Allocate items aiming to balance perceived values**:
   - Assign items with significant positive differences to Agent 0 and significant negative differences to Agent 1.
   - Consider balancing by perceived values.

### Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5

**Verification**:
- Total value for Agent 0: 47 (Item 1) + 56 (Item 2) + 55 (Item 3) + 97 (Item 4) + 92 (Item 6) = 347
- Total value for Agent 1: 47 (Item 0) + 24 (Item 5) = 71

This allocation gives a significant perceived value to Agent 0, which is unavoidable given their higher initial valuations. However, the difference in perceived values is minimized by giving Agent 1 items that are uniquely valuable to them (e.g., Item 0).

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 5]
}
```
