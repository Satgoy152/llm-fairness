Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6
0  72  65  86  64  44  40  7
1  85  68  39  58  24  17  8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or, if that's not possible, as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one in which no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [72, 65, 86, 64, 44, 40, 7]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [85, 68, 39, 58, 24, 17, 8]

To begin, we will aim to allocate the highest valued items for each agent to them while trying to balance the total value they each receive. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 2** is highly valued by both agents, but especially by Agent 0 (86 vs. 39). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0** is the next highest valued item and is more valuable to Agent 1 (85 vs. 72). Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 1** is similarly valued with a slight preference towards Agent 1 (68 vs. 65). Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3** is more valuable to Agent 0 (64 vs. 58). Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4** is more valuable to Agent 0 (44 vs. 24). Allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5** is more valuable to Agent 0 (40 vs. 17). Allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6** is more valuable to Agent 1 (8 vs. 7). Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's review the allocations for each agent:

- **Agent 0** receives items [2, 3, 4, 5].
- **Agent 1** receives items [0, 1, 6].

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 86 + 64 + 44 + 40 = 234, while Agent 1 receives a total valuation of 85 + 68 + 8 = 161. Although not perfectly balanced, this allocation respects the higher valuations of each agent where possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 6]
}
```
