Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  49  73  43  84  93  72
1  31  48   6  97  62  72  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or as close to envy-free allocation as possible. Envy-freeness means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation given to the other agent, based on their valuations.

Let's first look at the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 78 + 49 + 73 + 43 + 84 + 93 + 72 = 492
- Agent 1's total valuation: 31 + 48 + 6 + 97 + 62 + 72 + 55 = 371

Now, let's consider a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Greedy Allocation**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. This might not always lead to envy-freeness but is a good starting point.

2. Inspect the results and adjust if necessary to balance the envy.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 at 31. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 at 48. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 at 6. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 at 97. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 at 62. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 at 72. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 at 55. Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation gives Agent 0 all items except item 3, which is not balanced. Let's adjust to balance the allocation:

Adjusting the allocation to consider a fair distribution:

1. Agent 0 gets: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]
2. Agent 1 gets: [3, 6]

This allocation keeps the majority of high-value items with Agent 0 but gives Agent 1 item 3, which they value highly, and item 6.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the valuations more evenly between the agents, considering their preferences for the items available.
