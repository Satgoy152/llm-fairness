Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  99  51  11  42  46  51
1  28  79  45  76  77  24  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common method is to aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they received a set of items as valuable as the set allocated to the other agent.

To achieve this, we can use the following steps:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Determine the total valuation each agent has for all items combined.

   - Agent 0 Total Valuation: \(19 + 99 + 51 + 11 + 42 + 46 + 51 = 319\)
   - Agent 1 Total Valuation: \(28 + 79 + 45 + 76 + 77 + 24 + 10 = 339\)

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Individual Valuation**: Start by allocating items based on highest individual valuation to each agent, ensuring to balance the total valuation so neither agent feels envious.

3. **Adjust for Balance and Envy-Freeness**: Ensure that the allocation is as close as possible to equal total valuation for each agent, while also trying to minimize envy.

Following this approach, here's one possible allocation:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (second highest for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

**Valuations of Allocations:**

- Agent 0 Valuation: \(19 (item 0) + 99 (item 1) + 51 (item 2) + 46 (item 5) = 215\)
- Agent 1 Valuation: \(76 (item 3) + 77 (item 4) + 10 (item 6) = 163\)

The total valuations are quite balanced for each agent given the constraints, and this allocation should minimize envy.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
