Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  64   2  69  97  19  75
1  37  57  83  51  33  57  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents, we should aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation based on their valuations. One approach is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion, where each agent prefers their own allocation over the other's, given their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 60
  - Item 1: 64
  - Item 2: 2
  - Item 3: 69
  - Item 4: 97
  - Item 5: 19
  - Item 6: 75

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 37
  - Item 1: 57
  - Item 2: 83
  - Item 3: 51
  - Item 4: 33
  - Item 5: 57
  - Item 6: 14

First, let's sum the total valuations for each agent to understand their overall perspective:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 60 + 64 + 2 + 69 + 97 + 19 + 75 = 386
- Agent 1's total valuation: 37 + 57 + 83 + 51 + 33 + 57 + 14 = 332

Next, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total received valuation is as close as possible, considering their preferences. A simple approach is to prioritize items where there is a significant difference in valuations, which can help reduce envy:

1. Item 4 is highly valued by Agent 0 (97) compared to Agent 1 (33).
2. Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 1 (83) compared to Agent 0 (2).

Let's start by allocating these items according to the above priorities:

- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

Next, consider the remaining items:

- Items 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6 need to be allocated.

To further reduce envy, we can allocate based on combined valuations and remaining preferences:

- Item 6 is valued at 75 by Agent 0 and 14 by Agent 1, so allocate it to Agent 0.
- Item 0 is valued at 60 by Agent 0 and 37 by Agent 1, so allocate it to Agent 0.
- Item 1 is valued at 64 by Agent 0 and 57 by Agent 1. Since Agent 0 already has a higher total valuation from allocated items, allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Item 3 is valued at 69 by Agent 0 and 51 by Agent 1. Allocate it to Agent 1 to balance total valuations.
- Item 5 is valued at 19 by Agent 0 and 57 by Agent 1. Allocate it to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3, 5

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives valuable items based on their own valuations.
