Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  38  13  50  25  25  27
1  59  12  81  24  35  95  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items that another agent receives over their own bundle.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [14, 38, 13, 50, 25, 25, 27]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [59, 12, 81, 24, 35, 95, 97]

To achieve a fair division, we will first calculate the total value for each agent if they received all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 14 + 38 + 13 + 50 + 25 + 25 + 27 = 192
- Total value for Agent 1: 59 + 12 + 81 + 24 + 35 + 95 + 97 = 403

Given that Agent 1 has higher valuations overall, we should aim to allocate items in a way that balances the perceived value for each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this item more (59 vs. 14).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this item more (38 vs. 12).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values this item more (81 vs. 13).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item more (50 vs. 24).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this item more (35 vs. 25).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values this item much more (95 vs. 25).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values this item more (97 vs. 27).

Given these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 2, 4, 5, 6

This allocation gives:

- Total value for Agent 0: 38 (Item 1) + 50 (Item 3) = 88
- Total value for Agent 1: 59 (Item 0) + 81 (Item 2) + 35 (Item 4) + 95 (Item 5) + 97 (Item 6) = 315

This allocation minimizes envy because each agent receives items that they value highly relative to their preferences. The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
