Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  29  58  79  25  34  89
1  89  20  57  16   1  99  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair allocation of the items between the two agents, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers the bundle of the other agent over their own bundle. The goal is to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 6 + 29 + 58 + 79 + 25 + 34 + 89 = 320
- Agent 1's total valuation: 89 + 20 + 57 + 16 + 1 + 99 + 44 = 326

To achieve a fair allocation, we will try to distribute the items such that the perceived value of the allocation is approximately equal for both agents.

Let's consider a possible allocation:

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: 2, 3, 4, 6
   - Total valuation: 58 + 79 + 25 + 89 = 251

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: 0, 1, 5
   - Total valuation: 89 + 20 + 99 = 208

This allocation ensures that both agents get items that maximize their respective valuations. Agent 0 receives a total value of 251, while Agent 1 receives a total value of 208 based on their preferences. Though not perfectly balanced, this allocation provides a reasonable division given the constraints.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation divides the seven items between the two agents in a manner that seeks to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible given the limitations of integer allocations.
