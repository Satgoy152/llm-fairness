Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70   3   6  99  65  81  28
1  73  42  45  25  89  65  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider how each agent values the items. A common approach is to maximize the total utility for each agent while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation. Here's a potential allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 70
   - Item 1: 3
   - Item 2: 6
   - Item 3: 99
   - Item 4: 65
   - Item 5: 81
   - Item 6: 28

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 73
   - Item 1: 42
   - Item 2: 45
   - Item 3: 25
   - Item 4: 89
   - Item 5: 65
   - Item 6: 83

A simple way to start is by allocating items where one agent has a significantly higher valuation than the other, and then balance the remaining items.

- **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item at 99, whereas Agent 1 values it at 25.
- **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item at 89, whereas Agent 0 values it at 65.
- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item at 73, whereas Agent 0 values it at 70.
- **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item at 81, whereas Agent 1 values it at 65.
- **Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item at 83, whereas Agent 0 values it at 28.
- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item at 45, whereas Agent 0 values it at 6.
- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item at 3, whereas Agent 1 values it at 42.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their individual valuations without causing significant envy.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items such that both agents have a fair share according to their valuations, considering the constraints of integer allocation and the total number of items.
