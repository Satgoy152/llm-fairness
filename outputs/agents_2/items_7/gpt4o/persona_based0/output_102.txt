Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  81  60  43  17  42   3
1  26  97  59  46  46  79  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly, we need to consider their valuations for each item and attempt to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to it as possible.

Let's analyze the situation:

**Agent 0 Valuations:**
- Item 0: 52
- Item 1: 81
- Item 2: 60
- Item 3: 43
- Item 4: 17
- Item 5: 42
- Item 6: 3

**Agent 1 Valuations:**
- Item 0: 26
- Item 1: 97
- Item 2: 59
- Item 3: 46
- Item 4: 46
- Item 5: 79
- Item 6: 36

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the following strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest difference in valuations, giving the item to the agent who values it more.
2. Ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on the total value they perceive.

Let's calculate the total value each agent perceives for all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 52 + 81 + 60 + 43 + 17 + 42 + 3 = 298
- Total value for Agent 1: 26 + 97 + 59 + 46 + 46 + 79 + 36 = 389

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 1** is highly valued by both agents but more by Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1.
2. **Item 0** is valued more by Agent 0. Assign to Agent 0.
3. **Item 5** is valued more by Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1.
4. **Item 2** is valued more by Agent 0. Assign to Agent 0.
5. **Item 3** is valued similarly by both but slightly more by Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1.
6. **Item 4** is valued equally by both. To balance numbers, assign to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6** is valued more by Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1.

After this allocation, let's present the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total perceived values reasonably between both agents while ensuring each item is assigned.
