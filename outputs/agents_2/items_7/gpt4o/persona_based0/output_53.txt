Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  24   6  97  30  19  41
1  74  26  98  94  37  29  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 26 98 94 37 29 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum envy or ensuring envy-freeness. We'll aim to allocate items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation more than their own.

First, let's examine each agent's total valuation for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 79 + 24 + 6 + 97 + 30 + 19 + 41 = 296
- Agent 1's total valuation: 74 + 26 + 98 + 94 + 37 + 29 + 94 = 452

Next, we'll look at the valuations for each item and try to allocate them in a way that keeps the perceived value for each agent as balanced as possible.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it significantly higher (98) than Agent 0 (6).
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it higher (79) than Agent 1 (74).
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it higher (97) than Agent 1 (94).
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it slightly higher (26) than Agent 0 (24).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it higher (37) than Agent 0 (30).
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it higher (29) than Agent 0 (19).
7. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it higher (41) than Agent 1 (94).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 4, 5]

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
