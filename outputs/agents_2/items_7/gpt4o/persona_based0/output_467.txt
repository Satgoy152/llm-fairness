Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  31  22  84  51  69  55
1  67  88  41  76  26  83  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring envy-freeness. One way to approach this problem is to consider the preferences of each agent for each item and try to balance the allocations so that neither agent envies the other.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values the items as follows: [35, 31, 22, 84, 51, 69, 55].

2. **Agent 1** values the items as follows: [67, 88, 41, 76, 26, 83, 85].

Let's compare the value each agent places on each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 values it at 67.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 31, Agent 1 values it at 88.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 41.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 values it at 76.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 values it at 26.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 values it at 83.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 values it at 85.

To ensure fairness, a balanced approach would be to assign items to the agent who values them more, while keeping the total valuation relatively equal or ensuring that no agent feels they have received a less valuable bundle. 

Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign items 3, 4, and 5 to Agent 0. 
- Assign items 0, 1, 2, and 6 to Agent 1.

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives: Item 3 (84), Item 4 (51), Item 5 (69) for a total valuation of 204.
- Agent 1 receives: Item 0 (67), Item 1 (88), Item 2 (41), Item 6 (85) for a total valuation of 281.

While Agent 1 receives a higher total valuation, Agent 0 receives their most valued item (Item 3). This allocation attempts to balance the overall satisfaction given the disparity in individual item valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6]
}
```
