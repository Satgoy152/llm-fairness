Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  38  46  22  57  30  80
1  75   2  21  10  89  76  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [75  2 21 10 89 76 50]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents while minimizing envy, we must consider the valuations each agent places on the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: 94
  - Item 1: 38
  - Item 2: 46
  - Item 3: 22
  - Item 4: 57
  - Item 5: 30
  - Item 6: 80

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 2
  - Item 2: 21
  - Item 3: 10
  - Item 4: 89
  - Item 5: 76
  - Item 6: 50

### Strategy:
- We aim to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation of the items they receive is as equal as possible, thus reducing envy.
- Items should be allocated to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.

### Allocation:
1. **Assign high-value items to the agent who values them the most:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 94, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 75.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 89, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 57.

2. **Continue allocating by comparing remaining items' valuations:**
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 80, higher than Agent 1's 50.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 76, higher than Agent 0's 30.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 46, higher than Agent 1's 21.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 22, higher than Agent 1's 10.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 38, higher than Agent 1's 2.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, 3, 6, and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 4 and 5.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6, 1],
    "1": [4, 5]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their respective valuations, aiming to minimize envy and achieve a fair distribution.
