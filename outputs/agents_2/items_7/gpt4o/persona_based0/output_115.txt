Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58   0  32  88  19  84  10
1  87  14  65  84  81  90  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 14 65 84 81 90 63]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their share is at least as good as the share of the other agent, based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations first:

- Agent 0's valuations: [58, 0, 32, 88, 19, 84, 10]
- Agent 1's valuations: [87, 14, 65, 84, 81, 90, 63]

To find a fair allocation, we can use a simple method by comparing the valuations for each item and assigning the item to the agent who values it more, while ensuring each agent gets a fair total value.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values more (87 vs. 58)
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values more (0 vs. 14)
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values more (65 vs. 32)
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values more (88 vs. 84)
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values more (81 vs. 19)
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values more (90 vs. 84)
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values more (63 vs. 10)

Now let's sum up the values for each agent based on the above allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: [1, 3]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 0 + 88 = 88

- Agent 1 gets items: [0, 2, 4, 5, 6]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 87 + 65 + 81 + 90 + 63 = 386

This allocation might not be fair in terms of total value. To balance it, we need to re-evaluate the allocation ensuring both agents get an equitable share based on their valuations. Let's try another allocation:

1. Give item 0 to Agent 1 (87 vs. 58)
2. Give item 1 to Agent 1 (14 vs. 0)
3. Give item 2 to Agent 1 (65 vs. 32)
4. Give item 3 to Agent 0 (88 vs. 84)
5. Give item 4 to Agent 0 (19 vs. 81)
6. Give item 5 to Agent 1 (90 vs. 84)
7. Give item 6 to Agent 0 (10 vs. 63)

Now, we calculate the total values again:

- Agent 0 gets items: [3, 4, 6]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 88 + 19 + 10 = 117

- Agent 1 gets items: [0, 1, 2, 5]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 87 + 14 + 65 + 90 = 256

This still isn't balanced well. Let's try reallocating to get closer to a balanced allocation:

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 4, 6]

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly, and it is balanced more fairly:

- Agent 0's total value: 58 + 88 + 84 = 230
- Agent 1's total value: 14 + 65 + 81 + 63 = 223

This allocation is more balanced, and both agents have a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
