Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  10  17  64  82  60  73
1  12  72  57  99  53  48   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives according to their personal valuations. Given the valuations of agents for each item, we aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation relative to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 2
  - Item 1: 10
  - Item 2: 17
  - Item 3: 64
  - Item 4: 82
  - Item 5: 60
  - Item 6: 73

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 12
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 57
  - Item 3: 99
  - Item 4: 53
  - Item 5: 48
  - Item 6: 0

To allocate items fairly, we will aim to balance the total value that each agent receives based on their own valuations:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 4, 6, and 3. 
2. Agent 1 highly values items 3, 1, and 2.

To construct an allocation:

- Give item 4 to agent 0 (value 82 to 0).
- Give item 6 to agent 0 (value 73 to 0).
- Give item 3 to agent 1 (value 99 to 1).

Now let's allocate the remaining items:

- Give items 1 and 2 to agent 1 (total additional value 72 + 57 = 129 to 1).
- Give items 0 and 5 to agent 0 (total additional value 2 + 60 = 62 to 0).

This results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 4, 6, 0, and 5 with total value 82 + 73 + 2 + 60 = 217.
- Agent 1 receives items 3, 1, and 2 with total value 99 + 72 + 57 = 228.

While there is a slight imbalance, this allocation attempts to minimize envy based on the initial valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 0, 5],
    "1": [3, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated, and each agent receives items based on maximizing their individual valuations.
