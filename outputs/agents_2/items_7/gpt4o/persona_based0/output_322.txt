Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12   1  99  53  16  51  71
1  41  91  90  88  15   8  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their individual valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation as much as possible. This means each agent should feel that they have received a fair share compared to what the other agent received.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 12
  - Item 1: 1
  - Item 2: 99
  - Item 3: 53
  - Item 4: 16
  - Item 5: 51
  - Item 6: 71

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 41
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 90
  - Item 3: 88
  - Item 4: 15
  - Item 5: 8
  - Item 6: 73

To achieve a fair allocation, we can maximize the value each agent gets from their set of items, while ensuring no agent envies the other's allocation.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items for Agent 0 are: 2 (99), 6 (71), 3 (53)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items for Agent 1 are: 1 (91), 3 (88), 2 (90)

To ensure a fair distribution, we should balance these interests while keeping in mind the total number of items and the relative values each agent places on them.

### Proposed Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items: 2, 5, 6 (values: 99, 51, 71)
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 1, 3, 4 (values: 41, 91, 88, 15)

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 221 and Agent 1 a total value of 235. Although not perfectly balanced, the allocation closely matches each agent's preferences based on their highest valued items.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed fairly according to the agents' valuations and preferences.
