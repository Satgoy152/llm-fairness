Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  36  34   3   1  21  78
1   4  51  98  93  29  55   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

### Valuations:

- Agent 0: [23, 36, 34, 3, 1, 21, 78]
- Agent 1: [4, 51, 98, 93, 29, 55, 1]

### Total Valuations:

- Total for Agent 0: \(23 + 36 + 34 + 3 + 1 + 21 + 78 = 196\)
- Total for Agent 1: \(4 + 51 + 98 + 93 + 29 + 55 + 1 = 331\)

### Strategy:

To achieve fairness, we can aim for a balanced distribution of perceived value rather than the number of items. Let's allocate items so that the total value each agent receives is as close as possible to half of the total value they perceive in all items.

#### Allocation Process:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: This helps ensure each agent receives items they highly value.
   - Agent 0 highly values item 6 (78).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (98) and item 3 (93).

2. **Allocate high-value items**:
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Assign remaining items**:
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (since it has a higher valuation for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (since it has a higher valuation for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (since it has a higher valuation for Agent 1).

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 6]
  - Total valuation: 23 (item 0) + 78 (item 6) = 101
- **Agent 1**: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  - Total valuation: 51 (item 1) + 98 (item 2) + 93 (item 3) + 29 (item 4) + 55 (item 5) = 326

The allocations are designed to be fair based on the valuations each agent has for the items, ensuring neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
