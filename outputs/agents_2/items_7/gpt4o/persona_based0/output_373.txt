Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  46  81  93  48  48  26
1  23  59  54  66  73  93  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can apply a simple method that attempts to equalize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**:  
   - Agent 0: 10 + 46 + 81 + 93 + 48 + 48 + 26 = 352
   - Agent 1: 23 + 59 + 54 + 66 + 73 + 93 + 49 = 417

2. **Determine Fair Share**:  
   Since there are two agents, each agent should ideally get around half of the total value. The total value is 352 + 417 = 769, so each should get about 384.5.

3. **Allocate Items to Equalize Value**:  
   Let's allocate items to get as close as possible to an even distribution based on individual valuations.

   - Allocate items to Agent 0: Start by giving Agent 0 items where their valuation is significantly higher compared to Agent 1.
     - Item 2 (value 81 for Agent 0, 54 for Agent 1)
     - Item 3 (value 93 for Agent 0, 66 for Agent 1)
     - Item 0 (value 10 for Agent 0, 23 for Agent 1)
     - Item 6 (value 26 for Agent 0, 49 for Agent 1)

   - Allocate remaining items to Agent 1:
     - Item 1 (value 46 for Agent 0, 59 for Agent 1)
     - Item 4 (value 48 for Agent 0, 73 for Agent 1)
     - Item 5 (value 48 for Agent 0, 93 for Agent 1)

4. **Check Total Values**:
   - Agent 0: 81 + 93 + 10 + 26 = 210
   - Agent 1: 59 + 73 + 93 + 54 + 66 + 49 = 559

   This allocation doesn't meet the criteria for equal distribution of value, so we adjust further to balance the perceived values. After fine-tuning:

   - **Final Allocation**:
     - Agent 0: [2, 3, 6]
     - Agent 1: [0, 1, 4, 5]

5. **Recalculate Total Values**:
   - Agent 0: 81 + 93 + 26 = 200
   - Agent 1: 10 + 46 + 73 + 93 = 222

   This distribution is more balanced compared to previous allocations and ensures each agent receives items closer to their perceived fair share.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5]
}
```
