Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  37  49  78  67  86  62
1  98  18  63   3  34  78  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free or as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initial Analysis of Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [27, 37, 49, 78, 67, 86, 62]
   - Agent 1: [98, 18, 63, 3, 34, 78, 76]

2. **Sum of Valuations for Each Agent:**
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 27 + 37 + 49 + 78 + 67 + 86 + 62 = 406
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 98 + 18 + 63 + 3 + 34 + 78 + 76 = 370

3. **Allocating items:**
   - We should aim to allocate items such that the total valuation each agent receives is as close as possible to half of the total valuation of all items.
   - Total valuation of all items: 406 + 370 = 776
   - Therefore, each agent should ideally receive approximately 388 in total value.

4. **Assign Items:**
   - Start by assigning items that maximize each agent's valuation but also aim to distribute items fairly.
   - Since Agent 0 values item 5 highly (86) and Agent 1 values item 0 highly (98), these can be initial allocations.
   
   Let's allocate items one by one considering the highest valuations for each agent and balance the distribution:

   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (98)
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (86)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (76)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (78)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (67)
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (63)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (37)

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 1, 3, 4, 5
   - Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, 6

6. **Check Total Valuations:**
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 37 + 78 + 67 + 86 = 268
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 98 + 63 + 76 = 237

7. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   - Based on the constraints, the division above ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items. 
   - The allocation balances the high value items between agents to avoid envy, given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 6]
}
```
