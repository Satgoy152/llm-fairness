Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  81  50  67  22  82  46
1   5  38  71  64  67   7  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 38 71 64 67  7 60]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and ensure that the allocation is envy-free to the extent possible, given the discrete nature of the items. This means that each agent should ideally receive a share that they value at least as much as the share received by the other agent.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [88, 81, 50, 67, 22, 82, 46]
- Agent 1: [5, 38, 71, 64, 67, 7, 60]

### Total number of items:
- 7 items to be allocated.

### Steps to Allocate Items:
1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 1, and 5.
   - Agent 1 has high values for items 2, 4, and 6.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on High Values:**
   - Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items Considering Balance:**
   - Remaining items: 3, 5, 6.
   - Item 5 has a high value for Agent 0, so allocate it to Agent 0.
   - Item 6 has a high value for Agent 1, so allocate it to Agent 1.
   - Item 3 can be allocated to Agent 1 to balance the number of items.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 4, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and it balances the total number of items between the two agents.

    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6]
