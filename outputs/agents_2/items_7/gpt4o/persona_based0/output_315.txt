Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  89  62  90   3  35  43
1  90  66  38  30  49  13  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. This involves distributing the items such that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by the other agent over their own, given their valuations.

Let's consider each agent's valuation of the items:

- Agent 0's valuations: [36, 89, 62, 90, 3, 35, 43]
- Agent 1's valuations: [90, 66, 38, 30, 49, 13, 52]

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent feels that they received a fair share according to their valuation, and there is no envy.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **High Value Preference**: Initially, allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns to the items.
2. **Balancing**: Adjust if necessary to ensure each agent feels that the allocation is fair and is not envious of the other agent's allocation.

Let's start by identifying the highest valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 90.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 90.

Now let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 0**: This is the highest valued item for Agent 0.
2. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 1**: This is the highest valued item for Agent 1.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items, considering each agent's preferences and ensuring fairness.

### Remaining Allocation:
- Agent 0's remaining high-value items: 1 (89), 2 (62).
- Agent 1's remaining high-value items: 1 (66), 6 (52).

To ensure fairness, we'll proceed with an alternating allocation based on the remaining highest values:

3. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 1 at 89, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 66.
4. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: This item is more valuable to Agent 0 (62 vs 38 for Agent 1).
5. **Allocate item 6 to Agent 1**: This item is more valuable to Agent 1 (52 vs 43 for Agent 0).
6. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item at 49, higher than Agent 0's valuation of 3.
7. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 0**: This is the last remaining item. Agent 0 values it at 35, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 13.

### Final Allocation:

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly and minimizes potential envy between the two agents.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 a combination of items that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring that Agent 1 also receives items that are highly valued, thus aiming for an envy-free distribution.
