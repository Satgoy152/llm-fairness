Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  49  81   3  82  60  77
1  13  56  48  13   1   1  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider both maximizing the total value each agent receives and ensuring envy-freeness, which means each agent should feel they received their fair share given their valuations.

First, let's sum the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(21 + 49 + 81 + 3 + 82 + 60 + 77 = 373\)
- Agent 1: \(13 + 56 + 48 + 13 + 1 + 1 + 18 = 150\)

Next, let's identify strategies to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share and there's no envy.

1. Agent 0 has higher valuations in general, so they should receive more items or higher value items to satisfy their fair share.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 highly compared to others, so giving them item 1 might help achieve envy-freeness.

Considering these points, let's attempt the allocation:

- Start by allocating item 1 to Agent 1 since they value it highly.
- Allocate items 3, 4, 5, and 6 to Agent 0 to maximize their total valuation as they have higher valuations for these.
- Allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 0 as well due to higher valuation.

This allocation should provide a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.

Let's check if this allocation is envy-free:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(21 + 81 + 3 + 82 + 60 + 77 = 324\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(56\)

Agent 0's total valuation is significantly higher than Agent 1's, which might not be ideal from a fairness standpoint. To adjust, consider giving Agent 1 another item like item 6, which they value higher than some others.

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 6.

Let's verify:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(21 + 81 + 3 + 82 + 60 = 247\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(56 + 18 = 74\)

This allocation improves fairness and satisfies integer allocation requirements without any left-over items. Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 6]
}
```
