Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  56  25  85  76  56  70
1  54  83  40  98  59  66  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**'s total valuation for all items:  
   \(94 + 56 + 25 + 85 + 76 + 56 + 70 = 462\)

2. **Agent 1**'s total valuation for all items:  
   \(54 + 83 + 40 + 98 + 59 + 66 + 42 = 442\)

3. To achieve fairness, we aim to give each agent a bundle of items such that both agents feel they received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Let's begin by trying to balance the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0 (94), 3 (85), and 4 (76).
- Agent 1 highly values items 3 (98), 1 (83), and 5 (66).

By analyzing the highest valuations for each agent, we can distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's perceived value and minimizes envy.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign items with the highest valuation to each agent first, then balance remaining items.

#### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2, 4, 6  
  Total valuation for Agent 0: \(94 + 25 + 76 + 70 = 265\)

- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 3, 5  
  Total valuation for Agent 1: \(83 + 98 + 66 = 247\)

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share according to their valuations, and both have similar total valuations, providing a sense of fairness. 

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
