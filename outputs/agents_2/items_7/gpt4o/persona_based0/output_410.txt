Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  78   9   0  48  47  62
1  59  71  15  66  27  63  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we want to ensure that the allocation is both envy-free and maximizes the utility for each agent. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by the other agent over their own bundle. 

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [26, 78, 9, 0, 48, 47, 62]
- Agent 1's valuations: [59, 71, 15, 66, 27, 63, 77]

Let's approach this by looking at the total value each agent assigns to the items and try to balance the allocations:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Total value for Agent 0: 26 + 78 + 9 + 0 + 48 + 47 + 62 = 270
   - Total value for Agent 1: 59 + 71 + 15 + 66 + 27 + 63 + 77 = 378

2. For each agent, we aim to allocate items such that their perceived total value is as close as possible to the other agent's total perceived value, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share.

3. Allocate items to agents one by one, ensuring that each allocation remains envy-free and maximizes utility for each agent:

- Agent 1 highly values items 0, 3, and 6.
- Agent 0 highly values items 1, 4, and 5.

Let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it higher than Agent 0 does).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 1 does).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (as it balances the allocation better).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it considerably more).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it more).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (as it helps balance the perceived total values).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (as Agent 1 values it higher and it completes their bundle).

After ensuring each item is allocated and checking for envy-freeness and utility maximization:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair and envy-free distribution of items based on their valuations.
