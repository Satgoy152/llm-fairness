Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  40  28  60  48  25  54
1  69  47  25  61   2  81   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. 

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **List Each Agent's Total Valuation**: We will look at how much each agent values the items overall and try to balance the total value each agent receives.
   
2. **Calculate Total Valuation of Items**: 
   - Agent 0's total valuation: \(12 + 40 + 28 + 60 + 48 + 25 + 54 = 267\)
   - Agent 1's total valuation: \(69 + 47 + 25 + 61 + 2 + 81 + 2 = 287\)

3. **Allocate Items to Maximize Each Agent's Perceived Value**: We can start by assigning items to each agent based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of their perceived total value.

4. **Pair Items with Highest Valuations**: To maintain balance, we need to consider how each item is valued by both agents and allocate accordingly. 

   - Highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 (60), while for Agent 1, it's item 5 (81).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 and item 5 to Agent 1 initially.

5. **Continue with Remaining Items**: We will allocate the remaining items by comparing the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents and assigning them in a way that maintains balance.

6. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Once we have balanced the high-value items, distribute the remaining items in a manner that completes the allocation without leaving any agent with an unfairly low perceived value.

By following this methodology, we can aim to achieve an allocation that is fair and minimizes envy between the agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Allocate items [0, 3, 4, 6] to Agent 0.
- Allocate items [1, 2, 5] to Agent 1.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 receives items valued at \(12 + 60 + 48 + 54 = 174\) (per Agent 0's valuation).
- Agent 1 receives items valued at \(47 + 25 + 81 = 153\) (per Agent 1's valuation).

**Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
