Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44   9  76  60  94  62  84
1  63  40  44  98  39  70  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents, we aim to find an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible given the valuations. We have two agents (0 and 1) and seven items (0 through 6) to allocate.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 44 + 9 + 76 + 60 + 94 + 62 + 84 = 429
- Agent 1's total valuation: 63 + 40 + 44 + 98 + 39 + 70 + 55 = 409

Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is as close as possible to their total valuation divided by the number of agents (i.e., half of their total valuation).

Next, let's consider each item’s valuation difference between the agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (44) vs. Agent 1 (63) – Difference: 19 (Agent 1 values more)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (9) vs. Agent 1 (40) – Difference: 31 (Agent 1 values more)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (76) vs. Agent 1 (44) – Difference: 32 (Agent 0 values more)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (60) vs. Agent 1 (98) – Difference: 38 (Agent 1 values more)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (94) vs. Agent 1 (39) – Difference: 55 (Agent 0 values more)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (62) vs. Agent 1 (70) – Difference: 8 (Agent 1 values more)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (84) vs. Agent 1 (55) – Difference: 29 (Agent 0 values more)

By examining these differences, we can try to allocate items to the agent who values them more, while ensuring the total number of items allocated is balanced.

After considering all valuations, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 4, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 3, 5

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0's total perceived value: 76 + 94 + 84 = 254
- Agent 1's total perceived value: 63 + 40 + 98 + 70 = 271

Both agents receive items they value highly, and the division is reasonably balanced given the initial valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 5]
}
```
