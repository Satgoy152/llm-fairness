Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  53  87   7  89  91  82
1  32  38   3  34  31  14  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should prefer their bundle of items to that of the other agent, based on their own valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [83, 53, 87, 7, 89, 91, 82]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [32, 38, 3, 34, 31, 14, 96]

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction given the constraint of integer allocations.

### Allocations:

1. **Agent 0's highest-valued items:**
   - Item 5 (value 91)
   - Item 4 (value 89)
   - Item 2 (value 87)

2. **Agent 1's highest-valued items:**
   - Item 6 (value 96)
   - Item 1 (value 38)
   - Item 3 (value 34)

This leaves Item 0, which is highly valued by Agent 0 (83) and less valued by Agent 1 (32). Assigning this item to Agent 0 seems optimal.

### Proposed Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 6]

### Allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy and balance the distribution given the agents' preferences.
