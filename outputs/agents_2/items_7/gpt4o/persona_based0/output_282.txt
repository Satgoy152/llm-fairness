Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  86  11  10  17  60  20
1  65   0  62  82   9  73  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent believes they have received at least as much value as the other agent has from their respective allocations. We will consider the agents' valuations and attempt to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0:  
  - Item 0: 7  
  - Item 1: 86  
  - Item 2: 11  
  - Item 3: 10  
  - Item 4: 17  
  - Item 5: 60  
  - Item 6: 20  
  Total valuation for Agent 0: 211

- Agent 1:  
  - Item 0: 65  
  - Item 1: 0  
  - Item 2: 62  
  - Item 3: 82  
  - Item 4: 9  
  - Item 5: 73  
  - Item 6: 91  
  Total valuation for Agent 1: 382

Given the difference in total valuations, we'll seek a way to allocate items such that each agent perceives having a fair share:

One possible allocation is as follows:

1. Assign items to maximize fairness:
   - Allocate items with high individual value for each agent, balancing overall satisfaction.

2. Allocate items considering the total valuation differences for each item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it highly and Agent 1 values it at 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 because it has a high valuation for Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because it has a high valuation for Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 because it has a high valuation for Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 because it has a high valuation for Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because it balances the remaining items.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 because it balances the remaining items.

This allocation ensures that each agent believes they received a fair number of items based on their valuations.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the agents' valuations, ensuring a fair division of items.
