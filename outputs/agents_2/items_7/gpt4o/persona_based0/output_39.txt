Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  40  10  26  42  68  87
1   7   0  68  24  27  39  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuation, and no agent envies another.

Here are the steps to determine a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Start by identifying the items that each agent values highly.

2. **Allocate Items to Minimize Envy**: Try to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as close as possible.

3. **Ensure All Items are Allocated**: Since there are 7 items, make sure all are distributed between the two agents.

### Valuations Table:
- **Agent 0**: [91, 40, 10, 26, 42, 68, 87]
- **Agent 1**: [7, 0, 68, 24, 27, 39, 33]

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Agent 0** values item 0 (91) and item 6 (87) highly.
- **Agent 1** values item 2 (68) highly.

### Calculated Allocation:
1. **Agent 0** should receive items 0, 5, 6.
2. **Agent 1** should receive items 1, 2, 3, 4.

### Allocation Justification:
- **Agent 0's Total Value**: 91 (item 0) + 68 (item 5) + 87 (item 6) = 246
- **Agent 1's Total Value**: 0 (item 1) + 68 (item 2) + 24 (item 3) + 27 (item 4) = 119

Agent 0 receives items with higher absolute value, which aligns with their preferences, while Agent 1 receives a fair share based on their valuations.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers both agents' preferences and attempts to balance the total valuation received by each agent, minimizing envy while ensuring all items are distributed.
