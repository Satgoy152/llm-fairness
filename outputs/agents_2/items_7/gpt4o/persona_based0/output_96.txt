Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  14  20  30  35  45  57
1  88  58  59  70  70  28  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to find a division that is both envy-free and efficient. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own, based on their valuations. Given the valuations in the table, we can proceed with the allocation process.

### Valuations Matrix

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 99     | 14     | 20     | 30     | 35     | 45     | 57     |
| 1     | 88     | 58     | 59     | 70     | 70     | 28     | 13     |

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Look at each agent’s highest valued items and try to allocate these items to them.
2. **Comparative Valuation:** Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents and allocate items in such a way that reduces envy.
3. **Balancing Value:** Ensure the total value of items allocated to each agent is as balanced as possible, according to their individual valuations.

### Allocation
- **Agent 0:** Values item 0 the highest, so allocate it to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Values items 3 and 4 the highest (higher than Agent 0's valuation for the same items), so allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.
- Consider the remaining items and their potential envy implications.

#### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values it at 99, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation.
2. **Allocate Items 3 and 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values them at 70 each, which is higher than Agent 0's respective valuations.
3. **Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values it at 57 (higher than Agent 1’s 13).
4. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values it at 59 (higher than Agent 0’s 20).
5. **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values it at 45 (higher than Agent 1’s 28).
6. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values it at 58 (much higher than Agent 0’s 14).

### Final Allocation
This allocation attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent and minimize envy by considering how each agent values the items.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0, 5, and 6, while Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 3, and 4. This distribution ensures that both agents receive a fair share according to their valuations, minimizing the possibility of envy.
