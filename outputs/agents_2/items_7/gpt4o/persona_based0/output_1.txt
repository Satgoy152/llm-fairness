Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  74   9  69  91  21  37
1  39  82  50  40  60  54  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a fair division method such as the adjusted winner procedure or similar heuristic approach. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring no agent envies the other's allocation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Determine the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

   - Agent 0's Total Valuation: 21 + 74 + 9 + 69 + 91 + 21 + 37 = 322
   - Agent 1's Total Valuation: 39 + 82 + 50 + 40 + 60 + 54 + 79 = 404

2. **Rank Items by Value for Each Agent**: Rank the items based on each agent's valuation:

   - Agent 0's Rank: Item 4 (91), Item 1 (74), Item 3 (69), Item 6 (37), Item 0 (21), Item 5 (21), Item 2 (9)
   - Agent 1's Rank: Item 1 (82), Item 6 (79), Item 2 (50), Item 5 (54), Item 4 (60), Item 3 (40), Item 0 (39)

3. **Initial Allocation**: Allocate items based on the highest valuation for each agent, trying to balance the total valuation for both agents:

   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0)
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1)
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (remaining item)

4. **Check Allocations**: Verify that the allocations are complete, each agent gets an integer number of items, and exactly 7 items are allocated.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 6, 0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items based on their high valuations, minimizing envy. Agent 0 receives a total valuation of 181 (91 + 69 + 21), and Agent 1 receives a total valuation of 223 (82 + 79 + 39 + 50), which reflects a balanced distribution given their original total valuations.
