Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  75  68  63  21  15  40
1  51   2  24  60  47  34  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's an approach to achieve an allocation that is as fair as possible:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 99 + 75 + 68 + 63 + 21 + 15 + 40 = 381
   - Agent 1: 51 + 2 + 24 + 60 + 47 + 34 + 94 = 312

2. **Attempt to Balance Total Value:**
   - Since Agent 0 values the items more overall, we should try to allocate items such that both agents have a roughly equal share of their perceived total value.

3. **Item Prioritization:**
   - Allocate the highest valued items for each agent first, ensuring that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation.

4. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by assigning the top valued items for each agent, while considering the total value they perceive.

5. **Envy-Free Checking:**
   - After initial allocation, check if either agent prefers the otherâ€™s allocation. Adjust if necessary, prioritizing the next most valuable items for each agent.

Here is one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0's Valuation:**
  - Items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 
  - Values: [99, 75, 68, 63, 21, 15, 40]

- **Agent 1's Valuation:**
  - Items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  - Values: [51, 2, 24, 60, 47, 34, 94]

**Proposed Allocation:**
- Assign items 0, 1, 2 to Agent 0 (highest total perceived value: 99, 75, 68)
- Assign items 3, 4, 5, 6 to Agent 1 (best allocation to balance value)

**Allocation Values:**
- Agent 0: 99 + 75 + 68 = 242
- Agent 1: 60 + 47 + 34 + 94 = 235

This allocation ensures a close balance in perceived value between the two agents and attempts to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
