Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  26  57  20  45  55  39
1  88  28  55  28  81  34  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 26 57 20 45 55 39]
 [88 28 55 28 81 34 28]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we will analyze the valuations each agent has for the items and allocate them in a way that balances their perceived values.

Given the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  26  57  20  45  55  39
1  88  28  55  28  81  34  28
```

We want to ensure that each agent receives a mix of items such that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation.

**Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 96 + 26 + 57 + 20 + 45 + 55 + 39 = 338
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 88 + 28 + 55 + 28 + 81 + 34 + 28 = 342

**Step 2: Item Allocation**

Let's use a heuristic approach to allocate items based on the highest difference in valuation between agents. This approach helps in minimizing the envy by trying to give each agent the items they value more relative to the other.

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 values it at 88. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 values it at 28. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 values it at 55. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 values it at 28. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 values it at 81. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 values it at 34. Allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 values it at 28. Allocate to Agent 0.

**Final Allocation:**

Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 5, 6
Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 4

**JSON Output:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a bundle of items based on their preferences and attempts to minimize envy by allocating items where the valuation difference is most significant.
