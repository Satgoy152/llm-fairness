Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  40  91  68  91  57  90
1  14  54  94  53  31  21  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to give each agent items that maximize their individual satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to use the "Adjusted Winner Procedure" or similar methods to ensure envy-freeness, but given the small number of agents and items, we can manually allocate them based on maximizing each agent's valuation.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 Total Valuation: 51 + 40 + 91 + 68 + 91 + 57 + 90 = 488
- Agent 1 Total Valuation: 14 + 54 + 94 + 53 + 31 + 21 + 79 = 346

Given these totals, we aim to allocate items to ensure that each agent's share is as close as possible to half of the total value of all items and that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:
1. Start by allocating the item with the highest valuation to the agent who values it the most.
2. Repeat this process until all items are allocated.

Following this strategy:

1. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 1 (94 vs. 91). Assign to Agent 1.
2. Item 4 is valued equally by both agents, but since Agent 0 values it higher than any remaining item, assign to Agent 0.
3. Item 6 is valued higher by Agent 0 (90 vs. 79). Assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 3 is valued higher by Agent 0 (68 vs. 53). Assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 0 is valued higher by Agent 0 (51 vs. 14). Assign to Agent 0.
6. Item 5 is valued higher by Agent 0 (57 vs. 21). Assign to Agent 0.
7. Item 1 remains and is valued higher by Agent 1 (54 vs. 40). Assign to Agent 1.

This allocation method ensures neither agent feels envious of the other's items based on their individual valuations.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and both agents receive items based on their highest valuations.
