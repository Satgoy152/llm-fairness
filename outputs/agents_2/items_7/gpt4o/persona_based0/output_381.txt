Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  43  57  77  99  85  19
1  48  47  67  42   6  74  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division between the two agents, we aim for an allocation where each agent receives items such that the allocation is envy-free or as envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should value their bundle at least as much as they value the bundle of the other agent.

To begin, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(50 + 43 + 57 + 77 + 99 + 85 + 19 = 430\)
- Agent 1: \(48 + 47 + 67 + 42 + 6 + 74 + 11 = 295\)

Next, we allocate items such that each agent's total valuation of their bundle is maximized relative to the other agent's.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Item 4** has the highest value for Agent 0 (99) and the least for Agent 1 (6). Assign it to Agent 0.
2. **Item 3** has a significantly higher valuation for Agent 0 (77) compared to Agent 1 (42). Assign it to Agent 0.
3. **Item 5** has a higher valuation for Agent 0 (85) compared to Agent 1 (74). Assign it to Agent 0.
4. **Item 2** has a higher valuation for Agent 1 (67) compared to Agent 0 (57). Assign it to Agent 1.
5. **Item 1** has a slightly higher valuation for Agent 1 (47) compared to Agent 0 (43). Assign it to Agent 1.
6. **Item 0** has almost the same valuation for both agents, but we try to balance the total so far. Assign it to Agent 1 (since Agent 0 already has higher valued items).
7. **Item 6** has low valuation for both, but slightly higher for Agent 0 (19) than Agent 1 (11). Assign it to Agent 0.

This gives us the following allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3, 4, 5, 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 1, 2

### Valuation Totals:
- Agent 0's total: \(77 + 99 + 85 + 19 = 280\)
- Agent 1's total: \(48 + 47 + 67 = 162\)

These allocations maximize the satisfaction of both agents based on their valuations and ensure that each agent values their allocation more than or equal to what they would value the other's allocation.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
