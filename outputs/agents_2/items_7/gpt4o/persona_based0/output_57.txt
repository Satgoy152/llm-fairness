Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  26  44  49  66  87  69
1  60  20  62  19  92  47  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and minimize envy between the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. This involves ensuring that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation. We aim to allocate the items such that neither agent feels that another agent received a more valuable combination of items, according to their own valuation.

First, let's calculate the total value that each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 96 + 26 + 44 + 49 + 66 + 87 + 69 = 437
- Agent 1's total value: 60 + 20 + 62 + 19 + 92 + 47 + 91 = 391

Now, we will allocate items so that each agent's total valuation of their own bundle is as close as possible, to ensure fairness and reduce potential envy.

To achieve this, we can try different allocations and check their valuations:

1. Allocate items based on the highest valuations each agent has for specific items, and ensure that the total value for each agent is balanced:

- Agent 0 highly values items: 0, 5
- Agent 1 highly values items: 4, 6

We will allocate as follows:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 6

Now, let's check the total valuation for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0's allocation: [0, 1, 2, 5] → 96 + 26 + 44 + 87 = 253
- Agent 1's allocation: [3, 4, 6] → 19 + 92 + 91 = 202

This allocation considers both agents' preferences, balancing their total valuations fairly closely given the constraints of the problem.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
