Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  56  12  97  52  79  37
1  94  29  98  49  41  17  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[36 56 12 97 52 79 37]
 [94 29 98 49 41 17 52]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. A common approach is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent's allocation.

Let's assess the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0 values: [36, 56, 12, 97, 52, 79, 37]
- Agent 1 values: [94, 29, 98, 49, 41, 17, 52]

To find a fair division, we will consider each agent's preferences and try to balance the total valuation each receives.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign the highest-valued items from each agent's perspective.
   - Agent 0's highest value is item 3 (97).
   - Agent 1's highest value is item 2 (98).

2. **Next Highest Preferences:**
   - Agent 0's next highest value after item 3 is item 5 (79).
   - Agent 1's next highest value after item 2 is item 0 (94).

3. **Balancing and Remaining Items:**
   - The remaining items are 1, 4, and 6.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 (56) more than Agent 1 (29), so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 values item 6 (37) more than Agent 1 (52), so allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
   - The last item 4 (52) has a higher value for Agent 0 than Agent 1 (41), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [3, 5, 1, 4]
  - Total valuation: 97 + 79 + 56 + 52 = 284

- **Agent 1:** Items [2, 0, 6]
  - Total valuation: 98 + 94 + 52 = 244

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation received by both agents while respecting their preferences.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 0, 6]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 7 items and is structured to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints.
