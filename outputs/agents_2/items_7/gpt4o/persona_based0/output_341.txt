Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  12  24  13  46  66  97
1   3  20  13  17   4  87  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is also envy-free, we must consider the valuations of the agents for the items, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the total value. To do this, we can utilize the method of maximizing the Nash welfare, which attempts to balance the product of the utilities that agents derive from their allocations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to get a sense of their relative valuation scales:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 63 + 12 + 24 + 13 + 46 + 66 + 97 = 321
- Agent 1's total valuation: 3 + 20 + 13 + 17 + 4 + 87 + 62 = 206

The task is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items as per their valuations. A common approach is to use the concept of maximizing Nash welfare, which involves finding an allocation that maximizes the product of the utilities of the agents.

Given the valuations, a balanced allocation can be:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value: 63 for agent 0, 3 for agent 1)
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value: 12 for agent 0, 20 for agent 1)
- Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value: 24 for agent 0, 13 for agent 1)
- Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value: 13 for agent 0, 17 for agent 1)
- Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value: 46 for agent 0, 4 for agent 1)
- Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value: 66 for agent 0, 87 for agent 1)
- Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value: 97 for agent 0, 62 for agent 1)

This allocation aims to distribute the items in a way that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations and maximizes the Nash welfare.

Now, presenting the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items according to their preferences, balancing the valuations and maintaining fairness.
