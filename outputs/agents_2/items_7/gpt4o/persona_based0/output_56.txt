Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  21  55  60  80  77  62
1  91  67  44   8  36  44  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 67 44  8 36 44 85]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring no envy between them. We will assign items to the agents such that the total value each agent derives from their allocated items is as balanced as possible.

The valuations for the agents are as follows:

- Agent 0: [64, 21, 55, 60, 80, 77, 62]
- Agent 1: [91, 67, 44, 8, 36, 44, 85]

Let's calculate the total value each agent would get if they received all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 64 + 21 + 55 + 60 + 80 + 77 + 62 = 419
- Total value for Agent 1: 91 + 67 + 44 + 8 + 36 + 44 + 85 = 375

The goal is to distribute the items so that both agents have a fair share of the total value relative to their own valuations. Let's proceed with an allocation that aims to balance the values:

1. Assign items to Agent 0:
   - Item 0: Value 64
   - Item 1: Value 21
   - Item 3: Value 60
   - Item 4: Value 80

2. Assign items to Agent 1:
   - Item 2: Value 44
   - Item 5: Value 44
   - Item 6: Value 85

Now, let's verify the total value received by each agent:

- Total value for Agent 0: 64 + 21 + 60 + 80 = 225
- Total value for Agent 1: 44 + 44 + 85 = 173

The allocation ensures that Agent 1 receives items that they value highly, while Agent 0 receives more items but with a balanced total value. This allocation is fair in terms of the value each agent receives based on their own valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
