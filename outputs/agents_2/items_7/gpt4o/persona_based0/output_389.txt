Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  37  90  99  51  90  90
1  25  64  60   3  38  44  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible given the constraints. We will sum each agent's valuations for all items and try to balance the allocations so that the allocation reflects these valuations.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 44 + 37 + 90 + 99 + 51 + 90 + 90 = 501
   - Agent 1: 25 + 64 + 60 + 3 + 38 + 44 + 84 = 318

2. **Determine Proportional Allocation:**
   - Total valuation for all items = 501 + 318 = 819
   - Proportion of total valuation:
     - Agent 0: 501 / 819 ≈ 0.612
     - Agent 1: 318 / 819 ≈ 0.388

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Based on proportional valuation, Agent 0 should receive more high-value items to balance the total perceived value.

4. **Determine Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign items by comparing each item's relative valuation between agents and prioritizing higher-value items for each agent according to their total valuations.

5. **Adjust to Ensure Integer Allocations:**
   - Ensure each agent receives whole items, and the total number of items adds up to 7.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 5, 6
  - Total Value for Agent 0: 44 + 99 + 90 + 90 = 323
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 4
  - Total Value for Agent 1: 64 + 60 + 38 = 162

This allocation respects the relative valuations and attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives a fair share of value as per their valuations. The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
