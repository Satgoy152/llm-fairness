Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  84  89  18  54  68  35
1  36   8  40  95  88   4  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness or at least a fair distribution where each agent gets a bundle of items that maximizes their valuation. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **List the valuations for each agent:**

   - Agent 0: [74, 84, 89, 18, 54, 68, 35]
   - Agent 1: [36, 8, 40, 95, 88, 4, 26]

2. **Rank the items for each agent based on their valuations:**

   - Agent 0's ranking: Item 2 (89), Item 1 (84), Item 0 (74), Item 5 (68), Item 4 (54), Item 6 (35), Item 3 (18)
   - Agent 1's ranking: Item 3 (95), Item 4 (88), Item 2 (40), Item 0 (36), Item 6 (26), Item 5 (4), Item 1 (8)

3. **Allocate items by ensuring that both agents get the highest possible value for their share:**

   - Start by allocating the highest valued item for each agent if there's no conflict:
     - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
     - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   
   - Next, allocate the remaining items:
     - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
     - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.
     - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
     - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.
     - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1.

4. **Ensure that all 7 items are allocated:**

   After the allocation, each agent should have an appropriate number of items, and all items should be allocated.

Given the above steps, the allocation can be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their individual valuations given the constraints.
