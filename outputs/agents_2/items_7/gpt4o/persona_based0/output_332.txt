Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4  5   6
0  50   6  44  74  66  3  32
1  39  27  66  34  15  1  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free and efficient.

Let's calculate each agent's total valuation for all items to identify a fair division:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 50
- Item 1: 6
- Item 2: 44
- Item 3: 74
- Item 4: 66
- Item 5: 3
- Item 6: 32

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 39
- Item 1: 27
- Item 2: 66
- Item 3: 34
- Item 4: 15
- Item 5: 1
- Item 6: 12

Now, let's try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's perceived value and maintain envy-freeness:

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Allocate high-value items to each agent:** Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent based on their valuations.

**Agent 0:**
- Item 3 (value: 74 for agent 0, 34 for agent 1)
- Item 4 (value: 66 for agent 0, 15 for agent 1)
- Item 0 (value: 50 for agent 0, 39 for agent 1)

**Agent 1:**
- Item 2 (value: 66 for agent 1, 44 for agent 0)
- Item 1 (value: 27 for agent 1, 6 for agent 0)
- Item 6 (value: 12 for agent 1, 32 for agent 0)
- Item 5 (value: 1 for agent 1, 3 for agent 0)

### Final Allocation:
This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their total value without causing envy, keeping the distribution fair and efficient:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items in such a way that they are maximizing their own perceived total value, thus maintaining envy-freeness.
