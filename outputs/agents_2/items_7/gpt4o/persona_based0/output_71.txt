Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  91  15  82  16  78  53
1  35   2   6  86  78  52  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to ensure the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 61 + 91 + 15 + 82 + 16 + 78 + 53 = 396
- Agent 1's total valuation: 35 + 2 + 6 + 86 + 78 + 52 + 84 = 343

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items by maximizing each agent's valuation of their own assigned items while balancing the total value each agent receives.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 1 (value: 91)
   - Item 3 (value: 82)
   - Item 5 (value: 78)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 4 (value: 78)
   - Item 6 (value: 84)

Now, we have 2 items left to allocate: item 0 and item 2.

3. **Remaining Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives item 0 (value: 61), which is highly valued by Agent 0 compared to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 receives item 2 (value: 6), which is lowly valued by Agent 0, aligning with minimizing envy.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0's items:** 1, 3, 5, 0
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 91 + 82 + 78 + 61 = 312

- **Agent 1's items:** 4, 6, 2
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 78 + 84 + 6 = 168

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their own bundle, thereby reducing potential envy. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5, 0],
    "1": [4, 6, 2]
}
```
