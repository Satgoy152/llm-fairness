Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  69  61  50  55  77  87
1  48  53  50   8  74  21   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent prefers their own allocation over what is allocated to the other agent. While achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging with indivisible items, we can strive for a balanced approach where each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's first sum up the valuations for each agent:

**Agent 0's total valuation:**
- Item 0: 16
- Item 1: 69
- Item 2: 61
- Item 3: 50
- Item 4: 55
- Item 5: 77
- Item 6: 87

Total for Agent 0: 415

**Agent 1's total valuation:**
- Item 0: 48
- Item 1: 53
- Item 2: 50
- Item 3: 8
- Item 4: 74
- Item 5: 21
- Item 6: 8

Total for Agent 1: 262

Now, the goal is to allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations. We will try to allocate items based on higher relative valuations for each agent, aiming to balance the value of items each agent receives.

**Allocation strategy:**
1. Agent 0 highly values items 1, 2, 5, and 6.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 0, 4, and 1.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for Agent 0).
2. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for Agent 1).
5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
6. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (it is highly valued by both, but Agent 0 values it more).
7. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation aims to provide a relatively balanced distribution based on the agents' preferences.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
