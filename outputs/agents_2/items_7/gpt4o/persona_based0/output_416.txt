Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  36  58  27  61  22  21
1  67  54  30  14  28  44  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuation each agent has for each item and try to allocate the items such that no agent prefers the allocation of the other agent over their own.

Here's a breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: 
   - Items with highest valuations for Agent 0: 4 (61), 2 (58), 1 (36), 0 (35), 3 (27), 5 (22), 6 (21)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: 
   - Items with highest valuations for Agent 1: 0 (67), 1 (54), 5 (44), 6 (38), 2 (30), 4 (28), 3 (14)

Let's try to allocate the items such that each agent gets items they value highly, while also ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it is the highest valued item for Agent 0 and not as high for Agent 1.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as it is the highest valued item for Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, given it is highly valued by Agent 1 and less so by Agent 0.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as it is the second-highest valued item for Agent 0.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1, since it is highly valued by Agent 1.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1, also highly valued by Agent 1.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it is not highly valued by Agent 1.

With this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 5, 6

This distribution ensures that each agent gets some of their most valued items, and neither agent can improve their situation by swapping their allocation with the other.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5, 6]
}
```
