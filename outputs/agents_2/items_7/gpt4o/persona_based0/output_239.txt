Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  86  26  85  37  93  90
1   1  30  94  72  40  21   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 1 30 94 72 40 21  7]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, if possible, and efficient. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer the bundle of another agent over their own, given their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [94, 86, 26, 85, 37, 93, 90]
- Agent 1's valuations: [1, 30, 94, 72, 40, 21, 7]

### Steps to Allocate Fairly:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 2, 3, and 4.

2. **Find Potential Allocations:**
   - Start by assigning items that are most valued by each agent to avoid envy.
   - Agent 0 should get items that they value significantly and are not the top choices for Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 as it is their highest-valued item.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 as it is their highest-valued item.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 since Agent 1 values it less.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 as it is also highly valued by them.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 since Agent 1 values it the least.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 as it is highly valued by them and less by Agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 as Agent 0 values it the least.

### Final Allocation:

Agent 0's allocation: [0, 1, 5, 6]
Agent 1's allocation: [2, 3, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable share of items they value highly, attempting to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
