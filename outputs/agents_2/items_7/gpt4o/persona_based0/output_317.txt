Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  68   0  56   2  46  95
1  39  46  48   8  68  27  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 68  0 56  2 46 95]
 [39 46 48  8 68 27 73]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their own valuation while ensuring that all items are allocated.

### Valuations Matrix
```
Agent 0: [93, 68, 0, 56, 2, 46, 95]
Agent 1: [39, 46, 48, 8, 68, 27, 73]
```

### Total Valuation for All Items
- Agent 0: \(93 + 68 + 0 + 56 + 2 + 46 + 95 = 360\)
- Agent 1: \(39 + 46 + 48 + 8 + 68 + 27 + 73 = 309\)

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items: 0 (93), 6 (95), 1 (68)
   - Agent 1 highly values items: 4 (68), 2 (48), 6 (73)

2. **Allocate Items to Balance Valuations:**
   - Allocate items to ensure that the sum of valuations is balanced and minimize envy.
   - Prioritize assigning items where each agent has a significantly higher value than the other.

### Allocation Plan
- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0 (93): High value for Agent 0
  - Item 1 (68): High value for Agent 0
  - Item 3 (56): Next highest value for Agent 0
  - Item 5 (46): Next highest value for Agent 0

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 2 (48): High value for Agent 1
  - Item 4 (68): High value for Agent 1
  - Item 6 (73): High value for Agent 1

This allocation ensures both agents receive items they highly value, and the allocation is envy-free to a reasonable extent given the constraints.

### Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 3, and 5, while Agent 1 receives items 2, 4, and 6. This allocation uses all 7 items and respects the valuation preferences as closely as possible.
