Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  61  59  76  60  16  18
1  12  95  25  82  16  59  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means we try to distribute the items so that neither agent prefers the other's allocation to their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [9, 61, 59, 76, 60, 16, 18]
- Agent 1's valuations: [12, 95, 25, 82, 16, 59, 16]

To achieve a fair division, we can employ strategies such as the adjusted winner procedure or simply try to balance the total values each agent receives. Here, I'll attempt a simple allocation approach.

First, calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to get all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 9 + 61 + 59 + 76 + 60 + 16 + 18 = 299
- Agent 1's total valuation: 12 + 95 + 25 + 82 + 16 + 59 + 16 = 305

Given these total valuations, let's try to allocate the items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.

A possible allocation that balances the total value for both agents could be:

- Assign items 1, 2, 4, and 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 0, 3, and 5 to Agent 1.

Now let's verify the total valuations for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0's items: [1, 2, 4, 6] with valuations [61, 59, 60, 18] = 198
- Agent 1's items: [0, 3, 5] with valuations [12, 82, 59] = 153

This allocation is balanced in terms of total value, keeping both agents' allocations as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
