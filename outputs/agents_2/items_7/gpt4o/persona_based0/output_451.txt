Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  80  67   7  64  88   6
1  64  10  10  83  99  46  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method that seeks to balance the perceived value each agent receives. Let's evaluate how to do this:

### Valuations Table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 95     | 80     | 67     | 7      | 64     | 88     | 6      |
| 1     | 64     | 10     | 10     | 83     | 99     | 46     | 88     |

### Total Valuations:
- Agent 0's total valuation: 95 + 80 + 67 + 7 + 64 + 88 + 6 = 407
- Agent 1's total valuation: 64 + 10 + 10 + 83 + 99 + 46 + 88 = 400

### Allocation Strategy:
We need to distribute the items such that each agent gets a maximized perceived total value, while trying to ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

### Proposed Allocation:
- Assign items that each agent values significantly more than the other agent. 
- Ensure that the total number of items distributed equals 7.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0 (95 vs 64)
   - Item 1 (80 vs 10)
   - Item 2 (67 vs 10)
   - Item 5 (88 vs 46)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 3 (7 vs 83)
   - Item 4 (64 vs 99)
   - Item 6 (6 vs 88)

### Check Total Value:
- Agent 0's received value: 95 + 80 + 67 + 88 = 330
- Agent 1's received value: 83 + 99 + 88 = 270

This allocation gives higher total value to Agent 0, but it is reasonable given the distribution and preference differences across items.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and it tries to cater to each agent's highest preferences for the items they receive, aiming to reduce the potential for envy.
