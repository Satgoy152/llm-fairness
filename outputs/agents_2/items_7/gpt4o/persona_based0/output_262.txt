Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3   3  72  47  90   8  72
1  45  64  94  51  69  78  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims for an envy-free allocation. This involves ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's start by analyzing the total valuation for each agent:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Total valuation = 3 + 3 + 72 + 47 + 90 + 8 + 72 = 295

- **Agent 1:**
  - Total valuation = 45 + 64 + 94 + 51 + 69 + 78 + 46 = 447

Next, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they receive a fair proportion of their total valuation. One approach is to consider the proportional share (the sum of valuations divided by the number of items) as a guideline, but since we are dealing with discrete items, we may have to make some adjustments.

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing the satisfaction of each agent:

1. **Agent 0's Greedy Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 values items 4, 2, and 6 the most (90, 72, 72 respectively).

2. **Agent 1's Greedy Allocation:**
   - Agent 1 values items 2, 5, and 1 the most (94, 78, 64 respectively).

Initially, if we try to allocate based on highest valuations:

- Agent 0 could get items 4, 6 (since we need to ensure Agent 1 also gets high-value items).
- Agent 1 could get items 2, 5, 1.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 3 fairly, considering the current distribution.

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 at 51).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 45, Agent 0 at 3).

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items: 4, 6, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 5, 1, 0

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share according to their valuations, and no agent envies the other's allocation based on their personal valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 3],
    "1": [2, 5, 1, 0]
}
```
