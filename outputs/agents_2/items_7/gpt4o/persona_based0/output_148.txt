Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  83  37  23  10  20  38
1   9  28  34   2  77  84  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while striving for envy-freeness, we can start by examining the valuations provided by each agent for the items:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 76  
- Item 1: 83  
- Item 2: 37  
- Item 3: 23  
- Item 4: 10  
- Item 5: 20  
- Item 6: 38  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 9  
- Item 1: 28  
- Item 2: 34  
- Item 3: 2  
- Item 4: 77  
- Item 5: 84  
- Item 6: 93  

A reasonable approach to achieve fair division and minimize envy is to maximize each agent's total perceived value of the items they receive, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. 

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 1.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 5, 6, and 4.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on High Valuations:**
   - Allocate item 0 and item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate items 5, 6, and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Items 2 and 3 remain unallocated.
   - By valuation, Agent 0 has a higher relative value for item 2 than item 3.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

This allocation maximizes the values for each agent based on their preferences, while ensuring that each agent gets items they value highly.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2, which are among the higher-valued items according to their preference.
- Agent 1 receives items 3, 4, 5, and 6, which are highly valued in their perception.
- All 7 items are allocated, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
