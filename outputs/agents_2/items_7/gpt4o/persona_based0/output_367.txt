Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  28  43  96  61  81  48
1  50  38  97  84  99  83  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value the other agent's allocation. Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's valuation: 77 + 28 + 43 + 96 + 61 + 81 + 48 = 434
- Agent 1's valuation: 50 + 38 + 97 + 84 + 99 + 83 + 86 = 537

Next, a fair division approach should try to balance the total value of items allocated to each agent according to their valuations. This may not always lead to perfect envy-freeness, but it can provide a balanced allocation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Allocate items to Agent 0:**
   - Choose items that Agent 0 values highly. For instance, items 3 (96), 5 (81), and 0 (77).

2. **Allocate items to Agent 1:**
   - Choose items that Agent 1 values highly. For instance, items 4 (99), 2 (97), and 6 (86).

3. **Allocate any remaining items to balance the total number of items:**
   - Allocate item 1 (Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 values it at 38) to Agent 1 to balance the number of items.

Now let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 3, and 5.
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 2, 4, and 6.

Both agents receive a total of 3 and 4 items respectively, and the allocation tries to match their preferences based on their given valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
