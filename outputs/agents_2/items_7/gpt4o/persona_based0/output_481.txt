Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  91  96  19  62   0  72
1   2  54  91  54  82  91  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 54 91 54 82 91 75]]
Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we must allocate the 7 items between the 2 agents in a way that is as fair as possible. A commonly used fairness criterion is envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. 

Firstly, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [87, 91, 96, 19, 62, 0, 72]
- Agent 1's valuations: [2, 54, 91, 54, 82, 91, 75]

To achieve envy-freeness or come as close as possible, we should attempt to maximize each agent's total valuation of their assigned items, while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's explore a possible allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).

2. **Second Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).

3. **Third Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

**Final Allocations:**

- Agent 0 receives items [2, 0, 1, 3] with valuations [96, 87, 91, 19] giving a total valuation of 293.
- Agent 1 receives items [5, 6, 4] with valuations [91, 75, 82] giving a total valuation of 248.

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives, while respecting their preferences as much as possible. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 1, 3],
    "1": [5, 6, 4]
}
```
