Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  69  23  19  63  35  14
1  96  36  62  48  43  31   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation or come as close as possible given the constraints that each agent should receive an integer number of items, and all items must be allocated.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent derives from all items:

- Agent 0's valuations: [26, 69, 23, 19, 63, 35, 14]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 26 + 69 + 23 + 19 + 63 + 35 + 14 = 249

- Agent 1's valuations: [96, 36, 62, 48, 43, 31, 1]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 96 + 36 + 62 + 48 + 43 + 31 + 1 = 317

The goal is to distribute the items to maximize each agent's perceived value, while ensuring each agent has a fair share. A fair share can be defined as each agent receiving at least half of their total possible value (since there are two agents).

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Assign items based on highest individual value preference:**
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (96), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (69), so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Continue allocating based on remaining highest value:**
   - Next, Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (62), allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 4 next (63), allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

3. **Distribute remaining items:**
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (48 vs. 19), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (35 vs. 31), allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (14 vs. 1), allocate to Agent 0.

Based on these decisions, the allocation will be:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 4, 5, 6] 
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 3]

Verifying allocation:
- Agent 0's allocated value: 69 + 63 + 35 + 14 = 181
- Agent 1's allocated value: 96 + 62 + 48 = 206

Both agents are receiving more than half of their total potential value, and all items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
