Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  62  97  57  97  73  44
1  19  54  86  50  88  92  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

First, let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [40, 62, 97, 57, 97, 73, 44]
- Agent 1's valuations: [19, 54, 86, 50, 88, 92, 48]

Next, we can calculate the total value each agent perceives if they receive all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 40 + 62 + 97 + 57 + 97 + 73 + 44 = 470
- Total value for Agent 1: 19 + 54 + 86 + 50 + 88 + 92 + 48 = 337

For an envy-free allocation, we want to distribute the items such that each agent feels they get a fair share based on their total valuation.

To achieve this, we can use a round-robin or a similar heuristic approach to allocate items based on the highest value for each agent:

1. Agent 0 receives item 2 (highest value: 97)
2. Agent 1 receives item 5 (highest value: 92)
3. Agent 0 receives item 4 (next highest value: 97)
4. Agent 1 receives item 6 (next highest value: 48)
5. Agent 0 receives item 1 (next highest value: 62)
6. Agent 1 receives item 3 (next highest value: 50)
7. Agent 0 receives item 0 (next highest value: 40)

Now each agent has items allocated, and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [2, 4, 1, 0]
- Agent 1: [5, 6, 3]

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 1, 0],
    "1": [5, 6, 3]
}
```
