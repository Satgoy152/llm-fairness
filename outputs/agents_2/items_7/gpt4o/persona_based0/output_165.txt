Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  49  28  79   9  64  84
1  73  33  51  28  83  35  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as the other agent, based on their own valuations.

Let's start by reviewing the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 49
- Item 1: 49
- Item 2: 28
- Item 3: 79
- Item 4: 9
- Item 5: 64
- Item 6: 84

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 73
- Item 1: 33
- Item 2: 51
- Item 3: 28
- Item 4: 83
- Item 5: 35
- Item 6: 34

We will use a method that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation while maintaining the envy-free property:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 highest values: Item 6 (84), Item 3 (79), Item 5 (64)
   - Agent 1 highest values: Item 4 (83), Item 0 (73), Item 2 (51)

2. **Allocate items with significant value differences:**
   - Agent 0 highly values Item 6 (84), and Agent 1 values it at 34. We'll assign Item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values Item 4 (83), and Agent 0 values it at 9. We'll assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Continue with remaining items, trying to balance total value:**
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 because it's their next highest value (79).
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 because it's their next highest value (73).

4. **Allocate remaining items based on leftover values:**
   - Agent 0 should get Item 5 (64) as they value it higher than Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 should get Item 2 (51) as they value it higher than Agent 0.
   - Finally, Agent 0 gets Item 1 (49) as it balances out the total allocation.

Let's check the allocation:

- **Agent 0 receives:** Items 1, 3, 5, 6
- **Agent 1 receives:** Items 0, 2, 4

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy and ensure a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
