Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  3  82  17  69   1   5  36
1  4   2   9  50  89  48  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to find a distribution that minimizes envy, ideally achieving envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [3, 82, 17, 69, 1, 5, 36]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [4, 2, 9, 50, 89, 48, 90]

First, let's assess the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 3 + 82 + 17 + 69 + 1 + 5 + 36 = 213
- Total value for Agent 1: 4 + 2 + 9 + 50 + 89 + 48 + 90 = 292

Now, considering possible allocations:

1. **High-value items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0 highly values items 1 (82) and 3 (69).
   - Agent 1 highly values items 4 (89), 6 (90), and 5 (48).

2. **Strategic allocation to minimize envy**:
   - Assign high-value items of each agent to that agent, and then distribute the remaining items to balance the perceived value.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

- Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 0, as they are highly valued by Agent 0.
- Assign items 4 and 6 to Agent 1, as they are the highest valued by Agent 1.
- Distribute the remaining items (0, 2, 5) in a way that balances the total perceived value.

Given the valuations, a reasonable allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 5] 
  - Total value: 82 + 69 + 5 = 156
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 4, 6]
  - Total value: 4 + 9 + 89 + 90 = 192

This allocation is not exactly envy-free but aims to be fair by giving each agent some of their most valued items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
