Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  19  62  41  81  51  11
1   5  58  53  57  18  18  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy by ensuring each agent's valuation of their own allocation is as high as possible, relative to their valuations of allocations received by the other agent. One standard method to achieve this is using a method like the "Envy-Free Matching" approach, though exact envy-freeness is not always possible with indivisible items.

Let's calculate the total valuations each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 99 + 19 + 62 + 41 + 81 + 51 + 11 = 364
- Agent 1's total valuation: 5 + 58 + 53 + 57 + 18 + 18 + 60 = 269

We will allocate the items in a way that tries to balance the valuation each agent receives. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Start by giving each agent their highest valued items.
2. Balance the remaining items to minimize envy.

Agent 0's valuations (sorted): 
0: 99, 4: 81, 2: 62, 5: 51, 3: 41, 1: 19, 6: 11

Agent 1's valuations (sorted):
1: 58, 2: 53, 3: 57, 6: 60, 5: 18, 4: 18, 0: 5

Let's attempt the allocation:

- Give item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for Agent 0).
- Give item 1 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for Agent 1).
- Give item 4 to Agent 0 (second highest valuation for Agent 0).
- Give item 6 to Agent 1 (third highest valuation for Agent 1).
- Give item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest for Agent 0 and highly valued by Agent 1).
- Give item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest for Agent 1).
- Give item 5 to Agent 0 (remaining item).

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share based on their valuations while minimizing potential envy.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 6, 3]
}
```

This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
