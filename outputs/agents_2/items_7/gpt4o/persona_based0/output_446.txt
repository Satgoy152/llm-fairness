Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  69  29   8  28  13  73
1  96  20  88  54  61  76   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96 20 88 54 61 76  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring that envy is minimized, we can follow the concept of maximizing the total utility for each agent, keeping in mind their respective valuations for each item.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [90, 69, 29, 8, 28, 13, 73]
- Agent 1's valuations: [96, 20, 88, 54, 61, 76, 8]

One approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, thereby maximizing individual satisfaction:

1. Compare the valuations for each item:
    - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 96 compared to Agent 0's 90.
    - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 69 compared to Agent 1's 20.
    - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 88 compared to Agent 0's 29.
    - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 54 compared to Agent 0's 8.
    - Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 61 compared to Agent 0's 28.
    - Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 76 compared to Agent 0's 13.
    - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 73 compared to Agent 1's 8.

2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more:
    - Agent 1 gets items 0, 2, 3, 4, 5.
    - Agent 0 gets items 1, 6.

3. Validate the allocation:
    - Total items allocated: 7 (3 to Agent 0, 4 to Agent 1).

This allocation maximizes each agent's utility based on their valuations and ensures that every item is allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
