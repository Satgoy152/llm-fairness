Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  56  10  27  19  31  50
1  26  91  47  48  41  77  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to ensure a fair division, potentially minimizing envy between the agents. Given the valuations, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to balance the allocations so that each agent has approximately equal total value.

Let's calculate the total valuation for both agents:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(13 + 56 + 10 + 27 + 19 + 31 + 50 = 206\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(26 + 91 + 47 + 48 + 41 + 77 + 52 = 382\)

The total valuation by both agents for all items is \(206 + 382 = 588\). Ideally, each agent should have items totaling valuations close to half of this, i.e., about 294.

Now let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 1** values item 1 very highly (91), so let's allocate it to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 1** also has significant values for items 5 (77) and 3 (48). Let's allocate these to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** values item 6 (50) the highest, so let's allocate it to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 0** also has significant value for item 1 (56), but we've already allocated it to Agent 1. The next highest is item 5 (31), but it's allocated. So let's allocate items 4 (19) and 0 (13) to Agent 0.
5. At this point, we have allocated 5 items. The remaining items are 2 and 4. Agent 1 values item 2 (47) higher than Agent 0 (10), so allocate it to Agent 1.
6. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 for balance.

Summary of allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 4, 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 2, 3, 5

Let's check the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: \(13 + 19 + 50 = 82\)
- Agent 1: \(91 + 47 + 48 + 77 = 263\)

Given the constraints, this allocation is a reasonable balance considering both the total value and distribution of items.

Final allocation JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
