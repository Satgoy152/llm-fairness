Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  36  58  60  83  11   5
1   2  80  95  84  36  38  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that they received an allocation at least as valuable as any other allocation they could have received, given their own valuations.

### Valuations Table

Let's summarize the valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 58
  - Item 3: 60
  - Item 4: 83
  - Item 5: 11
  - Item 6: 5

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 2
  - Item 1: 80
  - Item 2: 95
  - Item 3: 84
  - Item 4: 36
  - Item 5: 38
  - Item 6: 42

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify the most valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 the most (98), followed by Item 4 (83).
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 the most (95), followed by Item 3 (84).

2. **Allocate based on highest individual valuations to minimize envy:**

   - **Agent 0:** Allocate Item 0 and Item 4 to Agent 0, as these are the highest valued items for them.
   - **Agent 1:** Allocate Item 2 and Item 3 to Agent 1, as these are the highest valued items for them.

3. **Allocate remaining items to balance valuations:**

   - Remaining items: 1, 5, 6
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 36, which is higher than Agent 1's value (80). 
   - Agent 1 values Item 5 at 38 and Item 6 at 42.

4. **Final allocation:**

   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 to balance Agent 1's total valuation.
   - Allocate Item 5 and Item 6 to Agent 1 since they have higher values for these items compared to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations and minimizes envy between the agents. Agent 0 receives their most valued items, while Agent 1 receives more items but with values that reflect their preferences.
