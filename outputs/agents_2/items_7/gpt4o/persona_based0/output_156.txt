Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  50  85  71  21  26   1
1  60   8  90  70  15  53  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can employ an approach that minimizes envy and attempts to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's one way to proceed:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 31, 50, 85, 71, 21, 26, 1
   - Agent 1: 60, 8, 90, 70, 15, 53, 97

2. **Identify High-Value Items**:
   - Items with the highest value for Agent 0: 2 (85) and 3 (71)
   - Items with the highest value for Agent 1: 6 (97) and 2 (90)

3. **Allocate High-Value Items**:
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as it holds significantly higher value for them.
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item.

4. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, since it is the next highest valued item for them and holds similar value for Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 for its relatively higher value for them.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 for its relatively higher value.
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1, as it holds more value for them than for Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0, completing the allocation.

**Final Allocation**:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5, 6

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
