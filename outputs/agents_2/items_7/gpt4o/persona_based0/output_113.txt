Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1  2   3   4   5   6
0  98  18  7  79  61  94  32
1  71  67  7  68  53  95  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives, given their valuations. This approach aims to distribute items in a way that minimizes the envy between agents.

First, let's summarize the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's valuations: 98, 18, 7, 79, 61, 94, 32
- Agent 1's valuations: 71, 67, 7, 68, 53, 95, 28

Total valuation for each agent:
- Agent 0: 98 + 18 + 7 + 79 + 61 + 94 + 32 = 389
- Agent 1: 71 + 67 + 7 + 68 + 53 + 95 + 28 = 389

Both agents have the same total valuation for all items, which is 389. This balance suggests that a fair allocation is possible.

We will try to allocate items such that both agents feel they are getting a fair share according to their perceived value. We will start by assigning items with the highest individual valuations to each agent, ensuring no overlap, and then fill in to balance the total perceived value.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. Assign the highest-valued item for each agent.

   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (98).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 5 (95).

2. Assign the next highest-valued items, considering the remaining items.

   - For Agent 0, the next highest is item 5 (94), but it's already taken by Agent 1. The next available is item 3 (79).
   - For Agent 1, the next highest available is item 1 (67).

3. Continue assigning to balance the perceived valuations:

   - Agent 0: Assign item 4 (61) and item 6 (32).
   - Agent 1: Assign item 2 (7).

Now, let's check the total valuation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, 4, 6: 
  Total valuation = 98 + 79 + 61 + 32 = 270

- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 5: 
  Total valuation = 67 + 7 + 95 = 169

Though the distribution is not perfectly equal in terms of total valuation, it respects individual valuations and attempts to minimize envy given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to respect the highest value items for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.
