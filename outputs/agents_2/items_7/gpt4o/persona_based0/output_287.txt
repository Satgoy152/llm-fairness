Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4  5   6
0  84  56  23  60  90  5  62
1  77  78  54   0  18  0   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 78 54  0 18  0  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to distribute them in such a way that the perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here's the valuation table for clarity:

```
          Item
         0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agent 0  84  56  23  60  90   5  62
Agent 1  77  78  54   0  18   0   8
```

Let's calculate the total value each agent perceives if they get certain items and aim to balance these values:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0, 4, and 6, among others.
- Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 2, among others.

A possible allocation that attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent might be:

- Assign items with high value for Agent 0: 0, 4, 6
- Assign items with high value for Agent 1: 1, 2, 3, 5

Let's check the total perceived value for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 4, 6] with values [84, 90, 62], totaling 236.
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 2, 3, 5] with values [78, 54, 0, 0], totaling 132.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a number of items proportional to their valuation while respecting their preferences. It may not be perfectly envy-free but achieves a balanced allocation given the constraints.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
