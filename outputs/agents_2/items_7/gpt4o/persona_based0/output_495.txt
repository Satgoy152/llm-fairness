Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  43  47  39  19  99  12
1   3  13  77  22  90  81  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to allocate them in a way that minimizes envy. The goal is to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation while ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's break down the valuations and allocate the items:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 24  
- Item 1: 43  
- Item 2: 47  
- Item 3: 39  
- Item 4: 19  
- Item 5: 99  
- Item 6: 12  

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 3  
- Item 1: 13  
- Item 2: 77  
- Item 3: 22  
- Item 4: 90  
- Item 5: 81  
- Item 6: 14  

### Strategy for Allocation
1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**  
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most (99).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (90).

2. **Assign high-value items:**  
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items to balance total value:**
   - Consider remaining high-valued items for each agent:
     - Agent 0: Item 2 (47), Item 1 (43), Item 3 (39)
     - Agent 1: Item 2 (77), Item 5 (81), Item 3 (22)

4. **Assign remaining items to minimize envy:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it 77).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it 43).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it 39).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it 24).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (both agents have low valuation, but it balances the number of items).

### Final Allocation
Based on the strategy outlined, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items they value more highly relative to Agent 1's valuation, and vice versa, ensuring a fair and envy-free division based on the given valuations.
