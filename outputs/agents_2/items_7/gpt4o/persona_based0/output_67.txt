Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  12  28  23  91  50  58
1  68  28  14  47  47  18  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. We should aim for allocations that maximize each agent's perceived value of their bundle while ensuring that neither agent is envious of the other.

Let's consider the total values each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 28 + 12 + 28 + 23 + 91 + 50 + 58 = 290
- Agent 1's total valuation: 68 + 28 + 14 + 47 + 47 + 18 + 10 = 232

Given that Agent 0 has a higher total valuation, a fair division should try to balance the perceived fairness by giving them a slightly higher value of items, but we also need to ensure that Agent 1 does not envy Agent 0.

We will try to allocate items so that each agent values their bundle at approximately half of the total value of all items, which is 522 / 2 = 261.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. Start by giving the highest-valued item of Agent 1 to Agent 1 to ensure they feel satisfied initially:
   - Item 0 (value 68 for Agent 1)

2. Next, allocate the highest-valued item for Agent 0:
   - Item 4 (value 91 for Agent 0)

3. Continue allocating items to balance the perceived value:
   - Agent 0: Item 6 (value 58 for Agent 0)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (value 47 for Agent 1)
   - Agent 0: Item 5 (value 50 for Agent 0)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (value 28 for Agent 1)
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (value 28 for Agent 0)

**Final allocation:**

Agent 0 receives items: 4, 6, 5, 2
- Total value for Agent 0: 91 + 58 + 50 + 28 = 227

Agent 1 receives items: 0, 3, 1
- Total value for Agent 1: 68 + 47 + 28 = 143

While not perfectly equal, this allocation respects the higher total valuation of Agent 0 while aiming to ensure envy-freeness, given the constraints.

**Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 5, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 1]
}
```
