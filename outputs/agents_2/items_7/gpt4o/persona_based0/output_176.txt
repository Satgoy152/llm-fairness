Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  26  38  34  45  49   4
1  91  34  37  17   8  42  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve the fair division problem with the goal of achieving envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items to the agents such that no agent prefers anotherâ€™s allocation to their own. Let's analyze the given valuation matrix:

Agent 0:
- Values: [22, 26, 38, 34, 45, 49, 4]

Agent 1:
- Values: [91, 34, 37, 17, 8, 42, 72]

We will try to allocate the items such that each agent's perceived value of their own allocation is maximized, while minimizing envy.

One possible approach is to allocate based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations, while checking for potential envy situations:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (91). Assign this to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (49). Assign this to Agent 0.
3. Agent 1 values item 6 second highest (72). Assign this to Agent 1.
4. Agent 0 values item 4 next highest (45). Assign this to Agent 0.
5. Agent 0 values item 2 next highest (38). Assign this to Agent 0.
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 has a higher valuation (34) than Agent 0's valuation (26).
7. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it has a higher valuation for Agent 0 (34) than Agent 1 (17).

Now let's check the allocations:

Agent 0:
- Has items: [2, 3, 4, 5]
- Total valuation: 38 + 34 + 45 + 49 = 166

Agent 1:
- Has items: [0, 1, 6]
- Total valuation: 91 + 34 + 72 = 197

This allocation maintains a somewhat balanced distribution of total valuations, considering the constraints of integer item allocations. 

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 6]
}
```
