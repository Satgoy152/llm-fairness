Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  45  77  43  30  55  43
1  89  53  72  56  90  12   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division, we need to allocate the items to the agents in such a way that the distribution minimizes envy between the agents. An envy-free allocation means that each agent should value their own bundle of items at least as much as they value any other agent's bundle.

Let's start by evaluating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 89 + 45 + 77 + 43 + 30 + 55 + 43 = 382
- Agent 1's total valuation: 89 + 53 + 72 + 56 + 90 + 12 + 2 = 374

Given the similar total valuations, we aim for each agent to receive about half of the total value they assign to the items.

Now, let's allocate the items by examining the valuations:

1. **High-value items:**
   - Item 0: Both agents value this item equally at 89. We can allocate it to either agent. Let's assign it to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values this item at 90, significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation of 30. It should go to Agent 1.

2. **Remaining items:**
   Let's try to balance the remaining items while maintaining fairness.

   - Agent 0:
     - Item 0: Value = 89 (already assigned)
     - Item 2: Value = 77
     - Item 5: Value = 55

   - Agent 1:
     - Item 4: Value = 90 (already assigned)
     - Item 1: Value = 53
     - Item 3: Value = 56
     - Item 6: Value = 2

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0's total value:** 89 (Item 0) + 77 (Item 2) + 55 (Item 5) = 221
- **Agent 1's total value:** 90 (Item 4) + 53 (Item 1) + 56 (Item 3) + 2 (Item 6) = 201

This allocation is likely to be envy-free because each agent receives a set of items they value highly, balancing the distribution of goods fairly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [4, 1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed between the two agents, with each agent receiving a set of items that reflects a fair division based on their individual valuations.
