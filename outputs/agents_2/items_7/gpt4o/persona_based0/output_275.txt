Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  68  20  93  22  88  14
1  63  95  63  53   2  83  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 95 63 53  2 83 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent prefers their own bundle of items over the bundle of the other agent.

Let's calculate the total value that each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 99 + 68 + 20 + 93 + 22 + 88 + 14 = 404
- Agent 1's total valuation: 63 + 95 + 63 + 53 + 2 + 83 + 71 = 430

Since the total valuations are relatively close, we can proceed to allocate items in a way that tries to balance the perceived value as evenly as possible.

One potential envy-free allocation can be made as follows:

1. Allocate items based on the highest value to each agent in alternating turns, considering the remaining unallocated items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 99, which is the highest single item valuation.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 95, which is the highest remaining valuation for Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 63, higher than Agent 0's value of 20.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 93, higher than Agent 1's value of 53.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 22, higher than Agent 1's value of 2.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 88, higher than Agent 1's value of 83.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 71, higher than Agent 0's value of 14.

Based on the above allocation steps, the final allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 6

Letâ€™s present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 6]
}
```
