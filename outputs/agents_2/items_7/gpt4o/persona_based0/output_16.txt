Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  98  88  34  64  61  92
1  43  28  99  50  93  68  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or at least reduces envy. An envy-free allocation is one where each agent feels they received at least as much value as they would have from any other bundle of items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
- Agent 0's total value: \( 86 + 98 + 88 + 34 + 64 + 61 + 92 = 523 \)
- Agent 1's total value: \( 43 + 28 + 99 + 50 + 93 + 68 + 98 = 479 \)

A fair division should consider these total valuations and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent perceives they have a fair share, either by absolute value or relative to their total valuations.

Let's consider the individual item valuations:
- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 86, Agent 1 values at 43
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 98, Agent 1 values at 28
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 88, Agent 1 values at 99
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 34, Agent 1 values at 50
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 64, Agent 1 values at 93
- Item 5: Agent 0 values at 61, Agent 1 values at 68
- Item 6: Agent 0 values at 92, Agent 1 values at 98

One strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, which can help minimize envy:

1. Item 0: Assign to Agent 0 (86 vs. 43)
2. Item 1: Assign to Agent 0 (98 vs. 28)
3. Item 2: Assign to Agent 1 (88 vs. 99)
4. Item 3: Assign to Agent 1 (34 vs. 50)
5. Item 4: Assign to Agent 1 (64 vs. 93)
6. Item 5: Assign to Agent 1 (61 vs. 68)
7. Item 6: Assign to Agent 1 (92 vs. 98)

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Total value for each agent:
- Agent 0: \( 86 + 98 = 184 \)
- Agent 1: \( 99 + 50 + 93 + 68 + 98 = 408 \)

This allocation reflects a preference for minimizing potential envy, as each agent receives the items they value the most.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
