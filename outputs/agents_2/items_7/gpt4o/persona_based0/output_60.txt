Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  70  40  95  95  86  76
1   5  70  86  96  79  90  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 70 86 96 79 90 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can utilize the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. In this context, envy-freeness means each agent should feel they received items of value at least equal to what the other agent received.

First, let's list the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [63, 70, 40, 95, 95, 86, 76]
- Agent 1: [5, 70, 86, 96, 79, 90, 71]

The total value each agent places on all items is:

- Agent 0: 63 + 70 + 40 + 95 + 95 + 86 + 76 = 525
- Agent 1: 5 + 70 + 86 + 96 + 79 + 90 + 71 = 497

Next, let's attempt to allocate the items to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while distributing the items fairly.

Allocation strategy:
1. Assign the items based on the highest relative difference in valuations.
2. Ensure both agents feel they are receiving a fair share, balancing the value and number of items.

Let's evaluate item allocation:

- Item 0: High value to Agent 0 (63 vs. 5)
- Item 1: Equal value to both (70 vs. 70)
- Item 2: High value to Agent 1 (40 vs. 86)
- Item 3: High value to Agent 1 (95 vs. 96)
- Item 4: High value to Agent 0 (95 vs. 79)
- Item 5: High value to Agent 1 (86 vs. 90)
- Item 6: High value to Agent 0 (76 vs. 71)

Considering the differences and balancing the total number of items, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 5

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: 63 + 70 + 95 + 76 = 304
- Agent 1: 86 + 96 + 90 = 272

Both agents receive 3 items each, and the allocation attempts to be fair based on their valuations.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
