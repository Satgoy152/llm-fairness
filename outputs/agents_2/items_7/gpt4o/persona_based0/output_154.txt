Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26   9  87  14  49  96  12
1  37  48  43  91  42  30  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a bundle of items that they value as highly as possible, while also aiming to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [26, 9, 87, 14, 49, 96, 12]
- Agent 1 values: [37, 48, 43, 91, 42, 30, 15]

We will attempt to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible according to their own valuations.

1. **Highest Value Items:**
   - Agent 0's highest values are for item 5 (96) and item 2 (87).
   - Agent 1's highest values are for item 3 (91) and item 1 (48).

2. **Next Steps:**
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining High Value Items:**
   - For Agent 0, the next highest valued item is item 2 (87).
   - For Agent 1, the next highest valued item is item 1 (48).

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

5. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items left are 0, 4, and 6.

6. **Balancing the Remaining Items:**
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (49 vs 42).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (37 vs 26).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (12 vs 15).

After these allocations, both agents have received a bundle of items, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 7.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 2, 4, 5, and 6, while Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 3. This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's valuation of their own bundle while keeping the distribution balanced.
