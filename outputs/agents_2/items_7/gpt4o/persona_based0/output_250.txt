Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  97  27  39  45  96  66
1  56  38  48  95  45   7   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim for an envy-free allocation. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items received by the other agent more than their own bundle.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 37
  - Item 1: 97
  - Item 2: 27
  - Item 3: 39
  - Item 4: 45
  - Item 5: 96
  - Item 6: 66

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 56
  - Item 1: 38
  - Item 2: 48
  - Item 3: 95
  - Item 4: 45
  - Item 5: 7
  - Item 6: 4

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they received all items:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 37 + 97 + 27 + 39 + 45 + 96 + 66 = 407
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 56 + 38 + 48 + 95 + 45 + 7 + 4 = 293

To ensure a fair and envy-free allocation, we should attempt to balance the perceived value each agent receives. One method to achieve this is to allocate items such that the total valuation of the items each agent receives is as equal as possible according to their respective valuations.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Start with the highest valued items for each agent and allocate them so that the total value received by each agent is balanced.

2. Allocate items to Agent 0:
   - Item 1: 97 (Agent 0's highest valued item)
   - Item 5: 96 (Agent 0's second highest valued item)

3. Allocate items to Agent 1:
   - Item 3: 95 (Agent 1's highest valued item)
   - Item 0: 56 (Agent 1's second highest valued item)

4. Continue allocating remaining items, balancing the total valuation:

   - Allocate items to Agent 0:
     - Item 6: 66
     - Item 4: 45

   - Allocate items to Agent 1:
     - Item 2: 48

This allocation results in:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 97 + 96 + 66 + 45 = 304
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 95 + 56 + 48 = 199

The allocations are somewhat balanced considering the initial total valuations. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6, 4],
    "1": [3, 0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed, with each agent receiving items based on maximizing their respective valuations, making the allocation fair given the constraints.
