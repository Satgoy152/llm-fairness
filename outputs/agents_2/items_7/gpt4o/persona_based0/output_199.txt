Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  19   3  51  52  40   7
1  27  92  30  78  57  66  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [27 92 30 78 57 66 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. This is a challenging problem, especially when striving for perfect envy-freeness, but we can try to minimize envy by considering each agent's preferences and values.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [12, 19, 3, 51, 52, 40, 7]
- Agent 1: [27, 92, 30, 78, 57, 66, 48]

We need to decide which items go to each agent to ensure fairness. One approach is to initially assign items based on each agent's highest valuation and then adjust to ensure envy-freeness to the extent possible.

### Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1 is 92).
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0 is 52).

### Remaining Items:

- Items 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6 need to be allocated.

### Adjusted Allocation for Fairness:

To balance the allocation, we can distribute the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations and trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1 is 78).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1 is 66).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1 is 48).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0 is 12).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0 is 3).

### Final Allocation:

After these allocations, the distribution is:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 0, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 5, 6]

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Total value = 52 (item 4) + 12 (item 0) + 3 (item 2) = 67
- Agent 1: Total value = 92 (item 1) + 78 (item 3) + 66 (item 5) + 48 (item 6) = 284

While this distribution isn't perfectly envy-free, it attempts to balance the high value items between the agents.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
