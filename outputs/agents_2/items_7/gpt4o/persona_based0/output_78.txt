Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  96  55   1  16  78  94
1  89  77  58  62  37  17  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and achieving envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the other's allocation. This is a challenging concept, but we can aim for a balanced distribution of total value perceived by each agent.

Let's start by calculating the total valuations for all items by each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 45 + 96 + 55 + 1 + 16 + 78 + 94 = 385
- Agent 1's total valuation: 89 + 77 + 58 + 62 + 37 + 17 + 75 = 415

Next, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent gets as close as possible to half of their total valuation while ensuring envy-freeness.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0 preferences (sorted by value):**  
   - Item 1 (96), Item 6 (94), Item 5 (78), Item 2 (55), Item 0 (45), Item 4 (16), Item 3 (1)

2. **Agent 1 preferences (sorted by value):**  
   - Item 0 (89), Item 1 (77), Item 2 (58), Item 3 (62), Item 6 (75), Item 4 (37), Item 5 (17)

### Allocation Process

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest value: Item 1 (96)
  - Next: Item 6 (94)
  - Next: Item 5 (78)
  - Total value: 96 + 94 + 78 = 268

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest value: Item 0 (89)
  - Next: Item 2 (58)
  - Next: Item 3 (62)
  - Next: Item 4 (37)
  - Total value: 89 + 58 + 62 + 37 = 246

### Final Allocation

Agent 0 gets items 1, 5, and 6.  
Agent 1 gets items 0, 2, 3, and 4.

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived total value for each agent, while ensuring each agent feels they are getting a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
