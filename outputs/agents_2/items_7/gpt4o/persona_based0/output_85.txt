Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  75  47  13  19  10  91
1  25  17  35  70  81  23  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocated items.

Firstly, let's calculate the total value of items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 17 + 75 + 47 + 13 + 19 + 10 + 91 = 272
- Agent 1: 25 + 17 + 35 + 70 + 81 + 23 + 48 = 299

Now, let's evaluate potential allocations that maximize each agent's total perceived value and attempt to ensure envy-freeness:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Allocate the highest-valued items to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 91.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 81.

2. **Next highest values:**
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (75)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (70)

3. **Continue with remaining items, alternating based on next highest value:**
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (47)
   - Agent 1: Item 6 is already allocated, so next in line is Item 5 (23)

4. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (17)
   - Agent 1: Only item 1 is left unallocated for Agent 1, which is already allocated to Agent 0. The next in line is Item 1 (17).

5. **Final allocations:**
   - Agent 0: [6, 1, 2, 0]
   - Agent 1: [4, 3, 5]

By following this allocation, we try to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share of high-valued items according to their own valuations.

Here are the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1, 2, 0],
    "1": [4, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, while the total number of allocated items remains 7.
