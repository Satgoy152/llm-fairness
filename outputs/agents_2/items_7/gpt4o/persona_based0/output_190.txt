Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  16  62  14  55  27   9
1  30  56  93  76  30  10  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that it minimizes envy, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. An allocation that minimizes envy is one where each agent receives a set of items such that they value their allocation at least as much as the other agent values their own allocation.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**:  
   - Agent 0: 99 + 16 + 62 + 14 + 55 + 27 + 9 = 282
   - Agent 1: 30 + 56 + 93 + 76 + 30 + 10 + 23 = 318

2. **Identify High Valuation Items**:  
   We will attempt to allocate items in such a way that each agent gets the items they value the most, while ensuring the total number of items is distributed evenly.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (value 99), so we will allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (value 93), so we will allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Next, Agent 1 highly values item 3 (value 76), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 4 (value 55), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 (value 56), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 5 (value 27), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Lastly, we allocate item 6 to Agent 0 as it balances the number of allocated items.

4. **Final Allocation Check**:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 5, 6
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3

This allocation ensures that both agents have three or four items, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
