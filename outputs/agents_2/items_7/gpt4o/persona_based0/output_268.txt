Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  13  97  40  28  16  23
1  85  89  19  49  52  32  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of every item. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the allocation of the other agent over their own.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(27 + 13 + 97 + 40 + 28 + 16 + 23 = 244\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(85 + 89 + 19 + 49 + 52 + 32 + 73 = 399\)

Next, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. One way to approach this is to use a method like "adjusted winner" or "maximum envy-free" allocation. Here, we can begin by assigning items that have significantly higher value for one agent over the other, and then adjust to balance the allocation.

### Steps to Allocate:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
    - Agent 0 values item 2 significantly more than Agent 1 does.
    - Agent 1 values items 0 and 1 significantly more than Agent 0 does.

2. **Initial allocation based on high valuation:**
    - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
    - Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Distribute remaining items to balance valuations:**
    - Agent 0: Items 3 and 5 (Agent 0 values these combined more than Agent 1).
    - Agent 1: Items 4 and 6 (Agent 1 values these combined more than Agent 0).

4. **Review allocation to ensure no envy:**
    - Agent 0: Items (2, 3, 5) with a total value of \(97 + 40 + 16 = 153\)
    - Agent 1: Items (0, 1, 4, 6) with a total value of \(85 + 89 + 52 + 73 = 299\)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value highly enough to not envy the other's allocation.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation is both envy-free and fair, given the constraints and valuations provided.
