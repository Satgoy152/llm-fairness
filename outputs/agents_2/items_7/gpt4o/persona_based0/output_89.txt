Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  89  55  98  28  25  38
1  73  41  53  96  90  45  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0's highest-valued items in descending order: Item 3 (98), Item 1 (89), Item 2 (55), Item 6 (38), Item 4 (28), Item 0 (26), Item 5 (25).
   - Agent 1's highest-valued items in descending order: Item 4 (90), Item 3 (96), Item 0 (73), Item 6 (66), Item 2 (53), Item 5 (45), Item 1 (41).

2. **Allocate items based on the highest valuations while ensuring all items are allocated:**
   - Start by giving each agent their highest-valued item.
   - Then, allocate the remaining items by alternating between the agents based on their next highest-valued items that have not been allocated.

3. **Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 3 and 1 (highest values for Agent 0 are 98 and 89).
   - Agent 1: Items 4 and 0 (highest values for Agent 1 are 90 and 73).
   - Allocate remaining items while considering alternating choices or balancing the total number of items:
     - Agent 0: Item 2 (next highest remaining value for Agent 0 is 55).
     - Agent 1: Item 6 (next highest remaining value for Agent 1 is 66).
     - Agent 0: Item 5 (remaining item).

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 1, 2, 5 (Total values: 98, 89, 55, 25)
- Agent 1: Items 4, 0, 6 (Total values: 90, 73, 66)

Based on this allocation, each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. The allocation aims to be fair according to the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [4, 0, 6]
}
```
