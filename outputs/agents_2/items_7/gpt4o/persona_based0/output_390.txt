Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95   1  74  95  34   2  30
1  31  35  52  75  42  10  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free distribution. This means each agent should feel they received at least as much value as they perceive the other agent to have received.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 95 + 1 + 74 + 95 + 34 + 2 + 30 = 331
   - Agent 1: 31 + 35 + 52 + 75 + 42 + 10 + 73 = 318

2. **Determine Fair Share**:
   - Agent 0's fair share: 331 / 2 = 165.5
   - Agent 1's fair share: 318 / 2 = 159

3. **Allocate Items to Maximize Each Agent's Satisfaction**:
   - Start by allocating high-value items to their highest-valuing agent until their fair share is met or exceeded, while ensuring the total allocation remains envy-free.

4. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Assign items based on value perceived, aiming to balance the total perceived value.

5. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness**:
   - Ensure that no agent would prefer the allocation of the other agent.

Following these steps, an allocation that satisfies the conditions might look like:

- **Agent 0's Allocation**: 
  - Items: 0, 3, 5 
  - Valuation: 95 + 95 + 2 = 192 (Agent 0's valuation)
  - Valuation for Agent 1 on these items: 31 + 75 + 10 = 116

- **Agent 1's Allocation**:
  - Items: 1, 2, 4, 6
  - Valuation: 35 + 52 + 42 + 73 = 202 (Agent 1's valuation)
  - Valuation for Agent 0 on these items: 1 + 74 + 34 + 30 = 139

This allocation is envy-free because each agent values their own allocation more than the other's.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
