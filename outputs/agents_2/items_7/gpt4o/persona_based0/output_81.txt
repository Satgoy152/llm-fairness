Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  96   2  63  14  26  12
1  34  16  84  33   3  42  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items such that their perceived value of the allocation is as balanced as possible. A common approach in fair division is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of the other over their own.

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 91 + 96 + 2 + 63 + 14 + 26 + 12 = 304
- Agent 1's total valuation: 34 + 16 + 84 + 33 + 3 + 42 + 24 = 236

Given these total valuations, we will try to allocate items such that each agent's share is proportional to their total valuation.

We start by considering high-value items for each agent and try to balance the perceived value:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 1. Assigning items 0 and 1 to Agent 0 would give them a combined value of 187.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 2. Assigning item 2 to Agent 1 gives them a value of 84.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (3, 4, 5, and 6) while trying to balance the total perceived value:

- Assign item 3 (value 63 for Agent 0, 33 for Agent 1) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 (value 42 for Agent 1, 26 for Agent 0) to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 (value 14 for Agent 0, 3 for Agent 1) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 (value 12 for Agent 0, 24 for Agent 1) to Agent 1.

Here's the perceived value after this allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1, 3, 4] with total value 91 + 96 + 63 + 14 = 264
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 5, 6] with total value 84 + 42 + 24 = 150

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they highly value, reducing the potential for envy.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
