Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  29  98   2  16  59  34
1  62  82  62  90   3  98  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close as possible to being envy-free. This means each agent should feel that their bundle is at least as good as the other's according to their own valuations. 

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations based on maximizing each agent's perceived value:

**Agent 0's valuations:**
- Item 0: 79
- Item 1: 29
- Item 2: 98
- Item 3: 2
- Item 4: 16
- Item 5: 59
- Item 6: 34

**Agent 1's valuations:**
- Item 0: 62
- Item 1: 82
- Item 2: 62
- Item 3: 90
- Item 4: 3
- Item 5: 98
- Item 6: 28

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 2 and 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 5 and 3.

2. **Start by allocating the highest value items to each agent:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value: 98).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value: 98).

3. **Continue allocating remaining items to maximize each agent's perceived fairness:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value: 79).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value: 90).

4. **Allocate remaining items while keeping balance:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value: 82).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value: 34).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (value: 16).

### Final Allocations:

- **Agent 0** receives items: 2, 0, 6, 4
- **Agent 1** receives items: 5, 3, 1

This allocation provides each agent with a substantial portion of their highest valued items, making it as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

{
    "0": [2, 0, 6, 4],
    "1": [5, 3, 1]
}
```
