Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  41  42   2  87  27  77
1  68  44  76  10  62  22  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we begin by considering the concept of envy-freeness. This means each agent should prefer their own allocation to that of the other agent, based on their individual valuations.

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: First, we sum the total valuation for each agent across all items.
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 55 + 41 + 42 + 2 + 87 + 27 + 77 = 331
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 68 + 44 + 76 + 10 + 62 + 22 + 36 = 318

2. **Target Valuation**: Ideally, each agent should get items totaling around half of the combined total valuation (331 + 318 = 649), which is approximately 324.5 for each agent.

3. **Allocation Strategy**: To ensure the allocation is envy-free, each agent should get the items for which they have a higher valuation relative to the other agent, while also keeping the total number of items balanced.

4. **Greedy Allocation**: We start by assigning each item to the agent who values it more, ensuring that both agents get a similar number of items.

   - Item 0: Agent 1 values at 68 vs Agent 0 at 55 -> Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values at 44 vs Agent 0 at 41 -> Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values at 76 vs Agent 0 at 42 -> Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values at 2 vs Agent 1 at 10 -> Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values at 87 vs Agent 1 at 62 -> Allocate to Agent 0
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values at 27 vs Agent 1 at 22 -> Allocate to Agent 0
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values at 77 vs Agent 1 at 36 -> Allocate to Agent 0

5. **Verify Allocation**: Ensure each agent has a similar number of items and check for envy-freeness.
   - Agent 0 receives: Items [4, 5, 6]
   - Agent 1 receives: Items [0, 1, 2, 3]

6. **Check for Envy-Freeness**:
   - Agent 0 values their allocation at: 87 + 27 + 77 = 191
   - Agent 1 values Agent 0's allocation at: 62 + 22 + 36 = 120
   - Agent 1 values their allocation at: 68 + 44 + 76 + 10 = 198
   - Agent 0 values Agent 1's allocation at: 55 + 41 + 42 + 2 = 140

Agent 0 prefers their allocation (191 vs 140), and Agent 1 prefers theirs (198 vs 120), confirming envy-freeness.

Final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```
