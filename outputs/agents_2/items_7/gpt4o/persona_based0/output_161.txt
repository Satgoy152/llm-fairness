Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  24  30   8  90  40  44
1   2  48  96  80  23  30  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items such that it is envy-free, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share based on their valuations.

To do this, we can apply the concept of maximizing each agent's minimum value received. We can start by considering the value each agent assigns to each item and try to distribute the items so that the sum of values for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the sum of each agent's valuation for the items and then attempt to assign the items to maximize fairness.

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 82  
- Item 1: 24  
- Item 2: 30  
- Item 3: 8  
- Item 4: 90  
- Item 5: 40  
- Item 6: 44  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 2  
- Item 1: 48  
- Item 2: 96  
- Item 3: 80  
- Item 4: 23  
- Item 5: 30  
- Item 6: 64  

The goal is to allocate seven items between the two agents.

### Allocation Strategy
1. Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 4. Similarly, Agent 1 highly values items 2 and 3.
2. Allocate items to each agent based on high preferences to ensure they receive maximum value.

### Proposed Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 5, 6
  - Total valuation for Agent 0 = 82 + 90 + 40 + 44 = 256
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3
  - Total valuation for Agent 1 = 48 + 96 + 80 = 224

This allocation attempts to maximize the perceived value each agent receives based on their preferences, ensuring as much fairness as possible.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, while distributing the total value as evenly as possible between them.
