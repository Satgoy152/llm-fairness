Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  97  38  90  69  96  33
1  18  14  28  81  55   1   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that neither agent prefers the other's allocation over their own. 

First, let's compute the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 42 + 97 + 38 + 90 + 69 + 96 + 33 = 465
- Agent 1's total valuation: 18 + 14 + 28 + 81 + 55 + 1 + 0 = 197

Next, let's try to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while maintaining envy-freeness.

### Allocation Strategy:
- We should aim to allocate items that each agent values highly, while balancing the total value each agent receives.

#### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most (97), so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (81), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0**'s next highest valued item is 5 (96), so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 0** also values item 3 highly (90), but it’s already allocated to Agent 1, so allocate item 4 (69) to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 1**'s next highest valued item is 4 (55), but it’s already allocated, so allocate item 2 (28) to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 0**'s next highest valued item is 0 (42), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 1**'s remaining items are 2 and 6, but item 2 is already allocated, so allocate item 6 (0) to Agent 1.

After this allocation, let's check:
- Agent 0 receives items [1, 5, 4, 0] with values [97, 96, 69, 42] totaling 304.
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 2, 6] with values [81, 28, 0] totaling 109.

Both allocations are consistent with the preferences and provide a fair division as much as possible given the constraints.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 4, 0],
    "1": [3, 2, 6]
}
```
