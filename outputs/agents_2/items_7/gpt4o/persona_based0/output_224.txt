Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  26  59  76  65  78  30
1  50  12  42  57  40  48  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as best as possible. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle. Given the valuations, we will try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [76, 26, 59, 76, 65, 78, 30]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [50, 12, 42, 57, 40, 48, 70]

We can proceed by attempting to maximize the total value each agent receives, while considering the possibility of envy:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items:** 5 (78), 0 (76), 3 (76)
2. **Agent 1's highest valued items:** 6 (70), 0 (50), 3 (57)

Given these preferences, we can try to distribute the items by ensuring each gets their high-value items or compromising where necessary.

### Initial Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 5 (value: 78)
  - Item 0 (value: 76)
  - Item 4 (value: 65)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 6 (value: 70)
  - Item 3 (value: 57)
  - Item 2 (value: 42)

This leaves us with item 1, which has low values for both agents. To finalize the allocation, we will assign this item to the agent who would experience less envy or who has the lower overall value:

- **Agent 1 gets item 1** (value: 12 for Agent 1, much lower for both agents, but keeps the distribution balanced in terms of number of items).

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 4, 5
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 2, 3, 6

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent while ensuring each agent gets a few of their highly valued items.

    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6]
}
