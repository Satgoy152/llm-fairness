Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  85  13   6  57  32  76
1  47  20  35  69  40  97   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 20 35 69 40 97  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents in a manner that aims to minimize envy, we can use a method like the adjusted winner procedure, or simply aim to maximize each agent's total utility while considering potential envy. 

Let's first list the valuations of each item for both agents:

- **Agent 0**'s valuations: [67, 85, 13, 6, 57, 32, 76]
- **Agent 1**'s valuations: [47, 20, 35, 69, 40, 97, 1]

For a fair division that aims to minimize envy, we try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring the other agent doesn't feel envious. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

### Step 1: Highest Valuation Allocation
1. Agent 0 values item 1 (85) the most.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 (97) the most.

Allocate these items to ensure each agent receives their highest valued item:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

### Step 2: Allocate Remaining Items

Now, consider the next highest valuations:

- Agent 0's next highest is item 6 (76).
- Agent 1's next highest is item 3 (69).

Allocate these items:

- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

### Step 3: Continue Allocating

Next, consider remaining valuations:

- Agent 0's remaining highest is item 0 (67).
- Agent 1's next highest is item 2 (35).

Allocate these items:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

### Step 4: Final Allocation

The remaining items are item 4 (valuations 57 for Agent 0 and 40 for Agent 1) and item 7 (valuations 32 for Agent 0 and 1 for Agent 1).

To minimize envy and balance the allocation:

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

This gives us the final allocations:

- **Agent 0** gets items: 1, 6, 0, 4
- **Agent 1** gets items: 5, 3, 2

### JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 0, 4],
    "1": [5, 3, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives while prioritizing each agent's highest valued items.
