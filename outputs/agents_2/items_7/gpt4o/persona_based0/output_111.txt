Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  49   7  65  19  13   9
1  87  70  12  15  51  58  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that attempts to minimize envy. Envy-freeness is not always achievable, but we can strive for an allocation that is as fair as possible given the constraints.

The total value each agent assigns to all items can be calculated as follows:

- Agent 0 total value: 92 + 49 + 7 + 65 + 19 + 13 + 9 = 254
- Agent 1 total value: 87 + 70 + 12 + 15 + 51 + 58 + 82 = 375

Considering these values, let's allocate the items by attempting to balance the perceived value each agent receives:

1. Allocate high-value items to each agent based on their preferences:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (92) and item 3 (65).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 6 (82) and item 1 (70).

2. Allocate other items to balance the total value each agent perceives:
   - Agent 0 can also receive items 2 (7) and 5 (13).
   - Agent 1 can receive items 4 (51).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 2, 5 (values: 92, 65, 7, 13) = Total perceived value: 177
- Agent 1: Items 1, 6, 4 (values: 70, 82, 51) = Total perceived value: 203

This allocation attempts to balance the values as closely as possible while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 6, 4]
}
```
