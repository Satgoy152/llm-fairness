Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  72  14  25  35  93   5
1  97  73  38  80  19  91  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find a fair division of the items among the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent for the 7 items:

- **Agent 0**: [12, 72, 14, 25, 35, 93, 5]
- **Agent 1**: [97, 73, 38, 80, 19, 91, 85]

We'll proceed with allocating items to balance the total value perceived by each agent.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Identify high-value items** for each agent to prioritize their allocation:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most (93), followed by item 1 (72).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (97), followed by item 5 (91).

2. **Allocate the highest valued items**:
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 since it is their highest valued item.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 since it is their highest valued item.

3. **Continue allocation by alternating high-value items**:
   - Next, Agent 0 should receive item 1 to maximize their value.
   - Next, allocate item 6 to Agent 1 since it provides them with substantial value (85).

4. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 as it is their next highest value (80).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

After these allocations, both agents have a fair share based on their valuations.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, which minimizes envy and maintains fairness as much as possible given the constraints.
