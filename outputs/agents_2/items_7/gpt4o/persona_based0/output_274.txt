Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  67  32   6  84  16  76
1  65  82  88  29  74  10  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we'll use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer the bundle of another agent over their own, given their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent would get for every possible allocation. Since we have two agents and seven items, we need to find a way to distribute these items that maximizes fairness.

We'll start by calculating the total valuation for a few possible allocations:

1. **Direct allocation based on highest individual valuations**:
    - Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 6
    - Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3, 5

    Valuations:
    - Agent 0: 87 + 84 + 76 = 247
    - Agent 1: 82 + 88 + 29 + 10 = 209

2. **Alternate allocation to balance total valuations**:
    - Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 5
    - Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 4, 6

    Valuations:
    - Agent 0: 87 + 32 + 16 = 135
    - Agent 1: 82 + 29 + 74 + 62 = 247

3. **Balanced allocation (attempt to balance total values)**:
    - Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 6
    - Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 4, 5

    Valuations:
    - Agent 0: 87 + 32 + 76 = 195
    - Agent 1: 82 + 29 + 74 + 10 = 195

From these calculations, the third allocation balances the total valuations between both agents while also considering the individual preferences of both agents.

Therefore, the fair allocation of items in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents have equal total valuations of 195, which is the most balanced distribution given their subjective valuations.
