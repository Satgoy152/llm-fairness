Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6
0  30  83  53  49   5  25  1
1  65  63  35  54  16   3  4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents in a way that is fair and attempts to minimize envy, we can use a method like the envy-free allocation or the adjusted winner procedure. However, given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items, a simple approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items based on the highest value per agent, while ensuring each agent ends up with a fair share.

Let's break down the allocation process:

1. **Initial Valuation Table:**

   | Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
   |------|---------|---------|
   | 0    | 30      | 65      |
   | 1    | 83      | 63      |
   | 2    | 53      | 35      |
   | 3    | 49      | 54      |
   | 4    | 5       | 16      |
   | 5    | 25      | 3       |
   | 6    | 1       | 4       |

2. **Total Valuation Calculation:**

   - Total value of items for Agent 0: 30 + 83 + 53 + 49 + 5 + 25 + 1 = 246
   - Total value of items for Agent 1: 65 + 63 + 35 + 54 + 16 + 3 + 4 = 240

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Sort items by the maximum difference in value between the two agents, allocating to the agent who values it more.

4. **Allocation Decision:**
   - **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 83, Agent 1 at 63. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 30, Agent 1 at 65. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 at 54. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 at 35. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 at 16. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 at 3. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - **Item 6:** Agent 0 values it at 1, Agent 1 at 4. Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Final Allocations:**

   - Agent 0: [1, 2, 5]
   - Agent 1: [0, 3, 4, 6]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by allocating items to the agent who values them more, keeping a balance between the two agents' total valuation of their allocated items.
