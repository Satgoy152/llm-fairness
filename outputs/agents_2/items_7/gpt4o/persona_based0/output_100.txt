Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  67  30  47  58  77  74
1  33  47  52  79  68  72  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation is one where each agent feels they have received at least as much value as they would from any other allocation.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 40 + 67 + 30 + 47 + 58 + 77 + 74 = 393
- Agent 1's total valuation: 33 + 47 + 52 + 79 + 68 + 72 + 58 = 409

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items in a way that considers these valuations and aims to be as fair as possible.

1. Agent 0 highly values item 5 (77) and item 6 (74).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 3 (79), item 5 (72), and item 4 (68).

To attempt a fair allocation, we can consider the highest valued items for both agents and try to distribute them accordingly. Here's one possible allocation:

- Allocate items 5 and 6 to Agent 0, as these are their highest valued items.
- Allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 1, as these are highly valued by them.

Now let's allocate the remaining items to balance the total value:

- Agent 0: Items 0 (40), 1 (67), and 2 (30). 
- Agent 1: Item 3 (79), 4 (68), and any remaining items to balance the value.

By distributing the remaining items, we achieve the following allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 2, 6]
- Agent 1: [3, 4, 5]

This allocation attempts to consider each agent's highest valued items and distribute the remaining items to balance the total perceived value.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while distributing all 7 items.
