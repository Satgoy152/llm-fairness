Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  31  84  64  44  73  14
1  69  82  15  50  94  92  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free, or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should value their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent.

Let's examine the valuations and consider possible allocations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 50
- Item 1: 31
- Item 2: 84
- Item 3: 64
- Item 4: 44
- Item 5: 73
- Item 6: 14

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 69
- Item 1: 82
- Item 2: 15
- Item 3: 50
- Item 4: 94
- Item 5: 92
- Item 6: 50

One strategy is to allocate items to maximize the total valuation for each agent as much as possible, while ensuring no agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's proceed with an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 highly values items 2 and 5. We assign these to Agent 0.
   - Items allocated to Agent 0: [2, 5]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 4. We assign these to Agent 1.
   - Items allocated to Agent 1: [1, 4]

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items [0, 3, 6] fairly:

3. **Remaining allocations**:
   - Agent 0 has a higher valuation for item 0 than Agent 1, so we assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Between items 3 and 6, Agent 0 has a higher valuation for item 3 than Agent 1, so we assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Finally, item 6 is assigned to Agent 1.

This results in:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: [1, 4, 6]

This allocation ensures that both agents get a fair share based on their valuations. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6]
}
```
