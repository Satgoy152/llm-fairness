Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9   2  11  91  58  98  16
1  21  18  57  20  14  34  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the total value, relative to their preferences. 

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [9, 2, 11, 91, 58, 98, 16]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [21, 18, 57, 20, 14, 34, 86]

We can start by assigning the most valued items to each agent, then balance the allocation by ensuring neither agent feels significantly disadvantaged.

1. **Agent 0**'s highest valued items are: 
   - Item 5 (value 98)
   - Item 3 (value 91)
   - Item 4 (value 58)

2. **Agent 1**'s highest valued items are:
   - Item 6 (value 86)
   - Item 2 (value 57)
   - Item 5 (value 34, but this has already been assigned to Agent 0)

By initially assigning items based on highest value, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 6, 2

This covers 5 items. Now, let's distribute the remaining items (0 and 1) to balance the total perceived value:

- **Remaining items**: 
  - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 values it at 21
  - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 values it at 18

Assigning the remaining items to further balance the allocation:

- Give Item 0 to Agent 1 (higher valuation by Agent 1)
- Give Item 1 to Agent 1 (higher valuation by Agent 1)

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2, 6

This allocation aims to minimize envy by ensuring each agent has items they highly value.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6]
}
```
