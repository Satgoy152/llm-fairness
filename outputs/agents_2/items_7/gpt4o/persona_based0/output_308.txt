Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2  3   4   5   6
0  50  77  86  9   3  89  78
1   0  90  46  2  43   3  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation means that each agent prefers their allocation to the allocation of the other agent.

Let's first calculate the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0:  
  - Item 0: 50  
  - Item 1: 77  
  - Item 2: 86  
  - Item 3: 9  
  - Item 4: 3  
  - Item 5: 89  
  - Item 6: 78  
  - **Total**: 392

- Agent 1:  
  - Item 0: 0  
  - Item 1: 90  
  - Item 2: 46  
  - Item 3: 2  
  - Item 4: 43  
  - Item 5: 3  
  - Item 6: 56  
  - **Total**: 240

Now let's try to allocate the items to achieve envy-freeness:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 2, 5, and 6. 
2. Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 4. 
3. Agent 0's least valued items are 3 and 4.

A fair allocation could be:

- Assign items 2, 5, and 6 to Agent 0. 
- Assign items 0, 1, 3, and 4 to Agent 1.

Let's check the resulting valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items 2, 5, and 6 with a total value of \(86 + 89 + 78 = 253\). 
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, 3, and 4 with a total value of \(0 + 90 + 2 + 43 = 135\).

Although Agent 0 receives a higher total value, we focused on ensuring that each agent receives the items they value highly. This allocation respects both agents' preferences, avoiding envy since Agent 1 receives their most valued item (item 1).

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```
