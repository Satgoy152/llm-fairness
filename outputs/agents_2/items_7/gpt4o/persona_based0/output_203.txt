Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  77  47  29  22  72  60
1  87  81  94  46  12  53  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 7 items between the two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1) in a manner that is fair and minimizes envy. The goal is to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as favorable or at least not less favorable than the allocation of the other agent.

To achieve this, we can employ a method that takes into account the valuations each agent places on each item. A simple approach is to use the Envy-Free Matching (EFM) algorithm, which attempts to allocate items such that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own, given their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent if they receive different items.

### Initial Analysis:
- Total valuation for all items: 
  - Agent 0: \(26 + 77 + 47 + 29 + 22 + 72 + 60 = 333\)
  - Agent 1: \(87 + 81 + 94 + 46 + 12 + 53 + 57 = 430\)

### Optimal Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign items to agents based on maximizing their individual valuations and ensuring an envy-free distribution.

Let's use a straightforward method by first considering which items each agent values the most:

- **Agent 0's highest valued items:** 
  - Item 5 (72), Item 1 (77), Item 6 (60)

- **Agent 1's highest valued items:**
  - Item 2 (94), Item 0 (87), Item 1 (81)

By examining the highest valued items, we can try to allocate them such that fairness is maintained. Consider the following allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 1, 5, 6
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 2, 3, 4

Let's check if this allocation is envy-free and fair based on the given valuations:

- **Agent 0's total valuation:** \(77 + 72 + 60 = 209\)
- **Agent 1's total valuation:** \(87 + 94 + 46 + 12 = 239\)

### Ensuring Fair Division:
This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, aiming to reduce envy. Agent 0 has a slightly lower total valuation due to the inherent difference in the total valuation of items, but they still receive items they value highly. The allocation is designed to balance the preferences as closely as possible.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to be fair and envy-minimized based on the given valuations.
