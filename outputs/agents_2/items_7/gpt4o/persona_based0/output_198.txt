Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  88  94  95   1  53  45
1  22  70   6  58  29  61  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that neither feels that another agent has received a better allocation. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation per Agent**:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: \(86 + 88 + 94 + 95 + 1 + 53 + 45 = 462\)
   - Agent 1's total valuation: \(22 + 70 + 6 + 58 + 29 + 61 + 77 = 323\)

2. **Fair Share for Each Agent**:
   - With 7 items, each agent should ideally receive close to half of the total value they assign to all items.
   - Fair share for Agent 0: \(462 / 2 = 231\)
   - Fair share for Agent 1: \(323 / 2 = 161.5\)

3. **Greedy Allocation Based on Valuation**:
   We will allocate items to each agent to closely match or exceed their fair share without exceeding it by too much.

   1. **Allocating to Agent 0**:
      - Agent 0 values items 3, 2, 1, and 0 the highest. Allocate these first:
        - Item 3: 95
        - Item 2: 94
        - Item 1: 88
      - Total value for Agent 0: \(95 + 94 + 88 = 277\)
      - This allocation fulfills Agent 0's fair share.

   2. **Allocating to Agent 1**:
      - Items remaining are 0, 4, 5, and 6. Allocate based on Agent 1's valuations:
        - Item 6: 77
        - Item 5: 61
        - Item 3: 58
        - Item 1: 70 (not available, already allocated to 0)
        - Allocate item 4: 29
      - Total value for Agent 1: \(77 + 61 + 29 = 167\)
      - This allocation fulfills Agent 1's fair share.

4. **Final Allocation Check**:
   - Ensure all items are allocated, and the allocations are envy-free:
     - Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2 (valuations: 95, 94, 88).
     - Agent 1 receives items 3, 4, 5, 6 (valuations: 58, 29, 61, 77).

The allocations are fair and meet the criteria. Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
