Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  17  82  79  84  13  79
1  67  80  65  90  28  84  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, considering their own valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [80, 17, 82, 79, 84, 13, 79]
- Agent 1: [67, 80, 65, 90, 28, 84, 56]

One common approach for such problems is to use the "round-robin" method or another simple method to ensure each agent receives items they value highly.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items 4, 2, and 0 highly.
   - Agent 1 values items 3, 5, and 1 highly.

2. **Allocate Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent sequentially, ensuring that they receive items they value highly.

3. **Balancing Remaining Items:**
   - After allocating the most valued items, distribute the remaining items to balance the total value each agent receives.

### Detailed Allocation:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest for Agent 0).
4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest for Agent 1).
5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest for Agent 0).
6. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (next highest for Agent 1).
7. Allocate item 6 to balance the allocation, considering Agent 1 has received fewer high-value items.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 0],
    "1": [3, 5, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items they value highly, while also distributing all items.
