Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  64  80  93  42  32  18
1  88  46  74  87  73  50  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's first examine the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 8 + 64 + 80 + 93 + 42 + 32 + 18 = 337
- Agent 1's total valuation: 88 + 46 + 74 + 87 + 73 + 50 + 49 = 467

Given these sums, Agent 1 values the items more highly overall. However, our task is to allocate items fairly, which typically involves balancing the total value each agent receives.

Let's attempt an allocation:

1. Assign items to the agent who values them most, starting with the highest valued items:
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 at 87. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 88, Agent 0 at 8. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 at 74. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 73, Agent 0 at 42. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 at 46. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 50, Agent 0 at 32. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 49, Agent 0 at 18. Assign to Agent 1.

Now let's examine the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: [3, 2, 1]
- Agent 1 receives items: [0, 4, 5, 6]

Verify the values each agent receives:

- Agent 0's valuation of their items: 93 + 80 + 64 = 237
- Agent 1's valuation of their items: 88 + 73 + 50 + 49 = 260

This allocation gives both agents a substantial share of their perceived value, maintaining a fair balance based on their respective valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 1],
    "1": [0, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
