Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  72  85  30  34  19  50
1  46  55  51  64  87  98  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations. We will use a simple approach by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are distributed.

### Valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [33, 72, 85, 30, 34, 19, 50]
- Agent 1's valuations: [46, 55, 51, 64, 87, 98, 69]

### Allocation Strategy:

1. Compare the valuations of each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.

### Allocation Process:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (46 vs. 33) → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (72 vs. 55) → Assign to Agent 0
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (85 vs. 51) → Assign to Agent 0
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (64 vs. 30) → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (87 vs. 34) → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it more (98 vs. 19) → Assign to Agent 1
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (69 vs. 50) → Assign to Agent 1

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [1, 2]
- Agent 1 receives items: [0, 3, 4, 5, 6]

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed while trying to minimize envy.
