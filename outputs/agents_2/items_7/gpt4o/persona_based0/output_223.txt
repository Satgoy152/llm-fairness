Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  58  22  37  73  30  99
1  82   4  95  91  76  93  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over that of the other agent, based on their valuations.

Let's first summarize the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(1 + 58 + 22 + 37 + 73 + 30 + 99 = 320\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(82 + 4 + 95 + 91 + 76 + 93 + 22 = 463\)

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the following method:

1. Sort the items by each agent's valuation in descending order.
2. Allocate items to each agent to balance the total value received by each.

Let's proceed with this approach:

### Step-by-Step Allocation

1. **Sort Items by Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: [6 (99), 4 (73), 1 (58), 5 (30), 3 (37), 2 (22), 0 (1)]
   - Agent 1: [2 (95), 5 (93), 3 (91), 0 (82), 4 (76), 6 (22), 1 (4)]

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start with the highest valued items for each agent and alternate allocations to balance total valuations as closely as possible.

**Allocation Plan:**

- Agent 0:
  - Item 6 (Value: 99)
  - Item 4 (Value: 73)
  - Item 1 (Value: 58)
  - Total value: 99 + 73 + 58 = 230

- Agent 1:
  - Item 2 (Value: 95)
  - Item 5 (Value: 93)
  - Item 3 (Value: 91)
  - Item 0 (Value: 82)
  - Total value: 95 + 93 + 91 + 82 = 361

After this allocation, we have assigned all 7 items. The total values are somewhat balanced while focusing on the highest-valued items for each agent.

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4, 1],
    "1": [2, 5, 3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive their share of high-value items according to their own valuations, while all items are allocated.
