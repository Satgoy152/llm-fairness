Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  1  81  44  14  20   1  87
1  8  74  74  44  22  62  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 1 81 44 14 20  1 87]
 [ 8 74 74 44 22 62 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim for an allocation that ensures envy-freeness, where each agent values their own bundle at least as much as they value the other agent's bundle. 

Let's evaluate the total valuations for each agent to understand their preferences:

- Agent 0's valuations: [1, 81, 44, 14, 20, 1, 87]
- Agent 1's valuations: [8, 74, 74, 44, 22, 62, 14]

The sum of valuations for each agent is:

- Agent 0: 1 + 81 + 44 + 14 + 20 + 1 + 87 = 248
- Agent 1: 8 + 74 + 74 + 44 + 22 + 62 + 14 = 298

To allocate the items, let's consider distributing the items such that each agent's total value of their allocated items is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Priority to High-Valuation Items**: Assign items with the highest valuations from each agent's perspective, trying to balance the total perceived value for each agent.

2. **Agent 0's Highest Valued Items**: 
   - Item 6 (Value: 87)
   - Item 1 (Value: 81)

3. **Agent 1's Highest Valued Items**: 
   - Item 2 (Value: 74)
   - Item 1 (Value: 74, but already assigned to Agent 0)
   - Item 5 (Value: 62)

4. **Balancing Remaining Items**:
   - Assign remaining items to balance the total value each agent perceives in their allocation.

### Proposed Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: [1, 4, 6]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 81 (Item 1) + 20 (Item 4) + 87 (Item 6) = 188

- Agent 1 gets items: [0, 2, 3, 5]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 8 (Item 0) + 74 (Item 2) + 44 (Item 3) + 62 (Item 5) = 188

The allocation balances the total perceived value for each agent, aiming for a fair division.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items valued equally in their own terms, aiming for envy-freeness and fairness.
