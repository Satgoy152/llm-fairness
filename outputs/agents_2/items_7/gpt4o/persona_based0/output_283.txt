Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  25   1  51  47  67  13
1  35  17  19  87  62  85  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness implies that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the other's, according to their own valuations.

Let's examine the valuations for each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: [56, 25, 1, 51, 47, 67, 13]
- Agent 1's valuations: [35, 17, 19, 87, 62, 85, 78]

We will allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their own valuations. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0's preferences**: Agent 0 has high values for items 5 (67), 0 (56), and 3 (51).
2. **Agent 1's preferences**: Agent 1 has high values for items 3 (87), 5 (85), and 6 (78).

A possible allocation could be structured as follows:

- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 because it is highly valued by both agents, but slightly more by Agent 1.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 because it is the highest valued item for them.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 as it is of high value to them and not as high to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 since it is not highly valued by Agent 1.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 because it is highly valued by Agent 1.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 since it is more valuable to them than to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 since neither agent values it highly, but it is less impactful.

The allocations can be summarized as:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 3, 4, 5, and 6.

This allocation tries to balance the preferences and values of both agents, considering their individual evaluations of the items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed between the two agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
