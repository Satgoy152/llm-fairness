Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  13  44  48  95  73  71
1  89  12  58  13  65  50   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as the bundle of items received by the other agent. Given the valuations provided, we can use a simple greedy allocation strategy.

First, let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 85
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 44
  - Item 3: 48
  - Item 4: 95
  - Item 5: 73
  - Item 6: 71
- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 12
  - Item 2: 58
  - Item 3: 13
  - Item 4: 65
  - Item 5: 50
  - Item 6: 5

To achieve envy-freeness, we allocate items to maximize the value each agent gets while trying to balance their total perceived value.

A possible allocation strategy is to start by examining which items are most valued by each agent and allocate them. Let's try allocating items such that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible:

1. Item 0: Allocating to Agent 1, as they value it higher (89 vs 85).
2. Item 1: Allocating to Agent 0, as they value it higher (13 vs 12).
3. Item 2: Allocating to Agent 1, as they value it higher (58 vs 44).
4. Item 3: Allocating to Agent 0, as they value it higher (48 vs 13).
5. Item 4: Allocating to Agent 0, as they value it higher (95 vs 65).
6. Item 5: Allocating to Agent 0, as they value it higher (73 vs 50).
7. Item 6: Allocating to Agent 0, as they value it higher (71 vs 5).

After this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 and Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2. The total valuation for each agent is:

- Agent 0: 13 + 48 + 95 + 73 + 71 = 300
- Agent 1: 89 + 58 = 147

This allocation does not seem envy-free, as Agent 1 might be envious of Agent 0's allocation. Let's adjust the allocation to be more balanced:

Rebalancing:

- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 instead of Agent 0, as this will help balance the valuations.
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 instead of Agent 0.

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 3, and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, 4, and 5.

Final valuations:

- Agent 0: 13 + 48 + 71 = 132
- Agent 1: 89 + 58 + 65 + 50 = 262

This is a more balanced allocation in terms of total value perceived by each agent.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
