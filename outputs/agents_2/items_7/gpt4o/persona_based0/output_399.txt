Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  37  10  12   6  42  19
1  67  65  46  63  81  52   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over the allocation given to the other agent.

The total valuation for each agent is calculated as follows:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 45 + 37 + 10 + 12 + 6 + 42 + 19 = 171
- Agent 1's total valuation: 67 + 65 + 46 + 63 + 81 + 52 + 8 = 382

Given these valuations, we can try to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives while aiming to balance the fairness.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2, 5, 6
  - Total valuation: 45 + 37 + 10 + 42 + 19 = 153
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
  - Total valuation: 63 + 81 = 144

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, and the total number of items allocated is equal to 7.

Let's represent this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers the preferences of both agents and attempts to balance fairness while respecting their individual valuations.
