Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  88  73  21  65  92  59
1  77  91   4  70  98  78  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we want to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair. One method to achieve this is by maximizing the total valuation each agent receives, which can also help in minimizing envy.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 88
  - Item 2: 73
  - Item 3: 21
  - Item 4: 65
  - Item 5: 92
  - Item 6: 59

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 77
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 70
  - Item 4: 98
  - Item 5: 78
  - Item 6: 41

To minimize envy, let's consider pairing each item with the agent who values it more. Sorting items based on the difference in valuations, we have:

1. Item 2: Agent 0 (73) vs Agent 1 (4) -> Difference: 69
2. Item 4: Agent 1 (98) vs Agent 0 (65) -> Difference: 33
3. Item 5: Agent 0 (92) vs Agent 1 (78) -> Difference: 14
4. Item 6: Agent 0 (59) vs Agent 1 (41) -> Difference: 18
5. Item 0: Agent 1 (77) vs Agent 0 (31) -> Difference: 46
6. Item 3: Agent 1 (70) vs Agent 0 (21) -> Difference: 49
7. Item 1: Agent 1 (91) vs Agent 0 (88) -> Difference: 3

Now, allocate items to the agent with the highest valuation:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1

Now, ensure that each agent gets the items they value more:

- Agent 0: [2, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 3, 4]

Therefore, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```
