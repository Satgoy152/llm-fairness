Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  58   3  16  78  83  95
1  64  90  84  96  31  66  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value assigned to any agent. This means we aim to balance the total valuations each agent receives to make the division as envy-free as possible.

Let's begin by calculating the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 36 + 58 + 3 + 16 + 78 + 83 + 95 = 369
- Agent 1's total valuation: 64 + 90 + 84 + 96 + 31 + 66 + 14 = 445

Next, we will try to allocate the items in a way that balances these valuations between the two agents. We aim to give each agent roughly equal total value according to their own valuations.

Let's examine possible allocations:

1. Assign items based on the highest difference in valuations between the two agents to the agent who values them more.

   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (64 vs. 36)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (90 vs. 58)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (84 vs. 3)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (96 vs. 16)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (78 vs. 31)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (83 vs. 66)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (95 vs. 14)

Using this strategy, we can try the following allocation:

- Assign items 4, 5, and 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 0, 1, 2, and 3 to Agent 1.

Now, let's calculate the total valuation each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives items 4, 5, and 6:
  - Total valuation for Agent 0 = 78 + 83 + 95 = 256

- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 3:
  - Total valuation for Agent 1 = 64 + 90 + 84 + 96 = 334

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 256 and Agent 1 a total valuation of 334. Although not perfectly balanced, it aims to minimize envy by giving each agent items they value more highly.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 7 items are distributed, with each agent receiving a set of items.
