Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  42  30  49  86  61  28
1  40  97  88  41  72  69  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that the distribution of items is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(12 + 42 + 30 + 49 + 86 + 61 + 28 = 308\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(40 + 97 + 88 + 41 + 72 + 69 + 96 = 503\)

Given these valuations, we seek to allocate items to achieve a balanced and fair distribution, taking into account the preferences of each agent.

A reasonable approach is to:

1. Prioritize giving each agent the items they value most.
2. Ensure that the allocation is as balanced as possible in terms of total valuation.

Let's proceed by allocating items:

1. **Agent 1** has a higher valuation for items 1, 2, and 6. So, they should receive these items.
2. **Agent 0** should receive items that they value relatively more compared to Agent 1, such as items 0, 3, and 5.
3. The remaining item (item 4) will be allocated based on maintaining balance and fairness.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 3, 5
  - Valuation: \(12 + 49 + 61 = 122\)
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 2, 4, 6
  - Valuation: \(97 + 88 + 72 + 96 = 353\)

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value highly and the distribution is balanced in terms of total valuation. While Agent 1 receives more total valuation, the allocation reflects each agent's preferences accurately.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
