Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  70  47  10  75  89  39
1  21  34  28  14  50  27  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items between agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution, where each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent. The total allocation should also use all available items.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0 values the items at: 82, 70, 47, 10, 75, 89, and 39. The total value is 412.
- Agent 1 values the items at: 21, 34, 28, 14, 50, 27, and 16. The total value is 190.

To create an envy-free allocation, we can try to balance the distribution of items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuation.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. Allocate items based on the highest valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives a comparable total value.

**Agent 0:**

- Highest valued items for Agent 0 are: 5 (89), 0 (82), 4 (75), and 1 (70).

**Agent 1:**

- Highest valued items for Agent 1 are: 4 (50), 1 (34), and 2 (28).

**Allocation Procedure:**

- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 3, 5, 6]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 82 + 10 + 89 + 39 = 220

- Agent 1 gets items: [1, 2, 4]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 34 + 28 + 50 = 112

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and the total value perceived by each agent is balanced relative to their own valuation.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
