Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  16  15   6  85  63  21
1  63  67  63  46  85  10  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that minimizes envy, we should aim for an envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation means that each agent should prefer or be indifferent to their own allocation over the allocation of the other agent, based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations given in the table:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 75
- Item 1: 16
- Item 2: 15
- Item 3: 6
- Item 4: 85
- Item 5: 63
- Item 6: 21

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 63
- Item 1: 67
- Item 2: 63
- Item 3: 46
- Item 4: 85
- Item 5: 10
- Item 6: 23

We will try to allocate the items in a way that keeps the total valuation of items for each agent as equal as possible.

One possible way to allocate the items is:

1. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 85, and Agent 1 values it at 85, but Agent 0 values it more in comparison to other items).
2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 75, and Agent 1 values it at 63).
3. Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 63, and Agent 1 values it at 10).
4. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (Agent 0 values it at 16, and Agent 1 values it at 67).
5. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (Agent 0 values it at 15, and Agent 1 values it at 63).
6. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (Agent 0 values it at 6, and Agent 1 values it at 46).
7. Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (Agent 0 values it at 21, and Agent 1 values it at 23).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 a total valuation of 223 (85 + 75 + 63).
- Agent 1 a total valuation of 199 (67 + 63 + 46 + 23).

This allocation minimizes envy since both agents receive a high total valuation, and neither agent strongly envies the other's allocation.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
