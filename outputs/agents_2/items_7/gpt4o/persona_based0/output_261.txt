Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  38  15  96  88  36  95
1  47  99  56  56  45  37  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims for envy-freeness in this scenario, we will allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations to minimize any potential envy. Envy-freeness means that each agent should not prefer the allocation of items given to another agent over their own allocation. 

Let's first summarize the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 79 + 38 + 15 + 96 + 88 + 36 + 95 = 447
- Agent 1's total valuation: 47 + 99 + 56 + 56 + 45 + 37 + 61 = 401

We will allocate the items in a way that tries to balance the total value received by each agent, considering their individual valuations.

1. Identify the highest value item for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 96.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 99.

2. Allocate these items to balance initial allocations based on high valuations:
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. Continue allocating the remaining items to balance total value:
   - Agent 0 receives: 0, 4, 6 (total value: 79 + 88 + 95 = 262)
   - Agent 1 receives: 2, 5 (total value: 56 + 37 = 93)

4. Final allocation check:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4, 6 (value: 79 + 96 + 88 + 95 = 358)
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 5 (value: 99 + 56 + 37 = 192)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
