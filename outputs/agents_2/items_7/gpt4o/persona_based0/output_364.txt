Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  77  36  42  63  86  91
1   3  50  56  37  51  78  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's first summarize the information:

- Agent 0's valuations: [73, 77, 36, 42, 63, 86, 91]
- Agent 1's valuations: [3, 50, 56, 37, 51, 78, 50]

A simple way to approach this is to try to maximize each agent's total valuation while keeping the allocations envy-free. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent should value their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:
1. Agent 0 values item 6 the most (91), so we will allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (78), so we will allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 5 (86), but since it's already allocated to Agent 1, we consider the next highest, which is item 1 (77). Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 2 (56). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
5. Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 0 (73). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
6. Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 4 (51). Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
7. The remaining items are item 3:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 42, and Agent 1 values it at 37. Since Agent 0 values it higher, allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

After this allocation, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0's items: [6, 1, 0, 3]
- Agent 1's items: [5, 2, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1, 0, 3],
    "1": [5, 2, 4]
}
```
