Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  59  87  24  97   7  85
1  26   8   8  76  89  14  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [26  8  8 76 89 14 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [12, 59, 87, 24, 97, 7, 85]
- Agent 1's valuations: [26, 8, 8, 76, 89, 14, 79]

One approach to achieve a fair division is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent feels they have a fair share relative to their preferences.

Let's start by calculating the total value for each agent if they received all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 12 + 59 + 87 + 24 + 97 + 7 + 85 = 371
- Total value for Agent 1: 26 + 8 + 8 + 76 + 89 + 14 + 79 = 300

Now, let's try to allocate items to minimize envy:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as they value it the most (97 vs 89).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it significantly more (76 vs 24).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it more (59 vs 8).
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as they value it almost equally but Agent 1 values it slightly more (79 vs 85).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it significantly more (87 vs 8).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as they value it more (14 vs 7).
7. Finally, assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it helps balance the total value (26 vs 12).

After this allocation, the distribution is:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 2, 4]
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 3, 5, 6]

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
