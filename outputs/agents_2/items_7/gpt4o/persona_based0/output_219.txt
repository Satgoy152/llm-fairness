Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  75  67  71  49  15  96
1  89  72  36  83  55  16  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or ensuring no envy if possible. Let's calculate the total valuations each agent has for all items and then allocate items to maximize fairness.

### Total Valuation for Each Agent:
- **Agent 0:** 6 + 75 + 67 + 71 + 49 + 15 + 96 = 379
- **Agent 1:** 89 + 72 + 36 + 83 + 55 + 16 + 35 = 386

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Identify the highest-valued items for each agent.** This will help in ensuring each agent gets at least some of their most valued items to reduce envy.
2. **Attempt to balance the total value each agent receives.** 

### Allocation Process:
- **Agent 0's top-valued items:** 96 (item 6), 75 (item 1), 71 (item 3)
- **Agent 1's top-valued items:** 89 (item 0), 83 (item 3), 72 (item 1)

We need to ensure that each agent receives a fair distribution. Note that some items might be valued highly by both agents, requiring a decision on who values it the most overall.

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as it's their highest-valued item.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it's their highest-valued item.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it more than Agent 0.
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0.
7. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it balances the number of items and value distribution.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 6, 1, 2
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 4, 5

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [6, 1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that both agents receive a fair share of items based on their valuations while maintaining a balanced distribution of total value.
