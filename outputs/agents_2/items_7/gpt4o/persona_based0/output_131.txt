Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1  2   3   4   5   6
0  72  47  2   6  22  34  52
1  12  96  9  66  28  75  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 96  9 66 28 75 96]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents (0 and 1), we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent receives items that maximize their utility based on their valuations and minimize any potential envy towards the other agent's allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations for each item:

- Agent 0 values: [72, 47, 2, 6, 22, 34, 52]
- Agent 1 values: [12, 96, 9, 66, 28, 75, 96]

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 has a higher valuation (72 vs. 12). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (96 vs. 47). Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (9 vs. 2). Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (66 vs. 6). Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (28 vs. 22). Allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (75 vs. 34). Allocate to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Both agents value it equally (52 vs. 96), but to balance the number of items (Agent 0 has only 1 so far), allocate to Agent 1.

Given the constraints, let's ensure we balance the allocation:

Currently, we have:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Agent 1 has 6 items, and Agent 0 has 1 item. To ensure fairness and a balanced allocation, we can adjust by considering the least valued item for Agent 1 with respect to Agent 0's need for more items, which is item 6. This retains a fair distribution based on total value.

Revised allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 6]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

This allocation gives Agent 0 high-value items and balances the number of items.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
