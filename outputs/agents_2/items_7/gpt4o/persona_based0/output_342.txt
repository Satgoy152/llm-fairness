Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  14  43  77  45  33  58
1  29  93  27  90  16  74  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[50 14 43 77 45 33 58]
 [29 93 27 90 16 74 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free, we want to ensure that each agent values their allocated bundle at least as much as the other's bundle. We will use the method of maximizing each agent's total valuation while considering the constraints.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [50, 14, 43, 77, 45, 33, 58]
- Agent 1's valuations: [29, 93, 27, 90, 16, 74, 65]

Let's allocate the items:

1. Start by allocating the item with the highest valuation for each agent, ensuring the total number of items allocated is 7.

2. Agent 0's highest valuations are for items 3 (77), 6 (58), and 0 (50).
3. Agent 1's highest valuations are for items 1 (93), 3 (90), and 5 (74).

Allocate items as follows:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 because it is the highest value for Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 because it is the highest value for Agent 1.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 because it is the high value for Agent 1.

Agent 1 now has items [1, 3, 5].

- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 because it is the highest value for Agent 0.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 because it is the high value for Agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 because it is the high value for Agent 0.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 because it is the remaining item.

Agent 0 now has items [0, 2, 4, 6].

Final allocations ensure that each agent has at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation maximizes each agent's total valuation without causing envy. Agent 0's total valuation is 50 + 43 + 45 + 58 = 196, and Agent 1's total valuation is 93 + 90 + 74 = 257. Each agent values their bundle highly, minimizing envy.
