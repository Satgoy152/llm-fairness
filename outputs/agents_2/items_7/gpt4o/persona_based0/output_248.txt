Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  80  62  54  84  42  71
1  69  18  20  47  13  52  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [69 18 20 47 13 52 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy, potentially by maximizing each agent's total valuation from their allocated items. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: `[60, 80, 62, 54, 84, 42, 71]`
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: `[69, 18, 20, 47, 13, 52, 22]`

The total number of items is 7. Let's attempt to allocate these items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is maximized and the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

**Step 1: Calculate total values for each agent's preferred allocation**

Agent 0's highest preferences (in descending order of value) are items 4, 1, 6, 2, 0, 3, 5.

Agent 1's highest preferences (in descending order of value) are items 0, 5, 3, 6, 2, 1, 4.

**Step 2: Allocate items to maximize sum of valuations while trying to minimize envy**

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (Agent 0: 84, Agent 1: 13)
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0: 80, Agent 1: 18)
3. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (Agent 0: 71, Agent 1: 22)
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 0: 60, Agent 1: 69)
5. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (Agent 0: 54, Agent 1: 47)
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (Agent 0: 42, Agent 1: 52)
7. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (Agent 0: 62, Agent 1: 20)

**Step 3: Final allocation**

Agent 0 receives items: 4, 1, 6, 2
Agent 1 receives items: 0, 3, 5

The final allocation gives:

Agent 0 total valuation: \(84 + 80 + 71 + 62 = 297\)

Agent 1 total valuation: \(69 + 47 + 52 = 168\)

This configuration should minimize envy and maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 6, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
