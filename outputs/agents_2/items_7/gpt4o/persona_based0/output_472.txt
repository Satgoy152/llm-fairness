Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  99  19   4  78  86  22
1  87  53  77  55  85  21  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we'll consider the valuations of each agent for the items and aim for a fair division that respects these valuations as much as possible. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences, without envying the other's allocation.

Let's start by examining the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(23 + 99 + 19 + 4 + 78 + 86 + 22 = 331\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(87 + 53 + 77 + 55 + 85 + 21 + 32 = 410\)

Given these totals, we can try to allocate items so that the perceived value of the allocations is as close as possible for both agents. A fair allocation should aim to balance the perceived value between agents.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Assign the highest valued items to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 1 (99), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0 (87), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Consider remaining items and balance the perceived value:**
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0. This gives Agent 0 an allocation with a perceived value of \(99 + 78 = 177\).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1. This gives Agent 1 an allocation with a perceived value of \(87 + 77 = 164\).
   
3. **Allocate the remaining items to balance the total valuations:**
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0. This increases Agent 0's perceived value to \(177 + 86 = 263\).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1. This increases Agent 1's perceived value to \(164 + 55 = 219\).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1. This increases Agent 1's perceived value to \(219 + 32 = 251\).

The allocations are fairly balanced in terms of perceived value:

- Agent 0's total perceived value: 263
- Agent 1's total perceived value: 251

While not perfectly equal, this division is reasonably fair given the constraints.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
