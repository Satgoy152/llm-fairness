Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  55  82  16  25  41  36
1   7  64  70  77  52  47  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, meaning no agent should prefer the allocation of the other agent to their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [33, 55, 82, 16, 25, 41, 36]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [7, 64, 70, 77, 52, 47, 97]

One approach to achieve a fair distribution is to use the method of "maximum sum of valuations" or "egalitarian distribution," where the total value each agent receives is maximized according to their valuation.

To achieve a fair allocation, we can allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's share based on their preferences.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Assign items 0, 2, and 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 3, 5, and 6 to Agent 1.

Let's calculate the total value for each agent:

- Agent 0: 33 (item 0) + 82 (item 2) + 25 (item 4) = 140
- Agent 1: 64 (item 1) + 77 (item 3) + 47 (item 5) + 97 (item 6) = 285

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, and, given the initial disparity in values, is as fair as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
