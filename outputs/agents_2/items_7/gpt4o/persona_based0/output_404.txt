Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  76  96  26  63  49  32
1  49  82  62  48  78  31  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, meaning that each agent should prefer their own allocation over the other's. A common approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items while maintaining fairness.

Let's start by considering the total valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [69, 76, 96, 26, 63, 49, 32]
- Agent 1's valuations: [49, 82, 62, 48, 78, 31, 79]

We can try the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction.
2. Ensure no agent envies the other's allocation by checking that each agent's total valuation of their allocation is greater than or equal to what would be their total valuation of the other's allocation.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item:  
   - Item 0: 69 (Agent 0) vs 49 (Agent 1) -> Agent 0 prefers by 20
   - Item 1: 76 (Agent 0) vs 82 (Agent 1) -> Agent 1 prefers by 6
   - Item 2: 96 (Agent 0) vs 62 (Agent 1) -> Agent 0 prefers by 34
   - Item 3: 26 (Agent 0) vs 48 (Agent 1) -> Agent 1 prefers by 22
   - Item 4: 63 (Agent 0) vs 78 (Agent 1) -> Agent 1 prefers by 15
   - Item 5: 49 (Agent 0) vs 31 (Agent 1) -> Agent 0 prefers by 18
   - Item 6: 32 (Agent 0) vs 79 (Agent 1) -> Agent 1 prefers by 47

2. Assign items to each agent based on their preferences:

- Agent 0 gets items with higher preference differences: Items 0, 2, and 5
- Agent 1 gets items with higher preference differences: Items 1, 3, 4, and 6

This allocation ensures each agent ends up with a total value that they prefer over the other's allocation.

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to maintain a balance between both agents, maximizing their valuation of their respective allocations.
