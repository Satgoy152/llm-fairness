Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  98   2  10  29  25  81
1  49  76  84  99  94   3  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to balance the total value each agent receives. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's total value if given all items: 82 + 98 + 2 + 10 + 29 + 25 + 81 = 327
   - Agent 1's total value if given all items: 49 + 76 + 84 + 99 + 94 + 3 + 62 = 467

2. **Determine the Fair Share:**
   - Since there are 2 agents, each agent should aim to receive approximately half of the total value if it were distributed evenly.
   - Total value for all items: 327 + 467 = 794
   - Fair share per agent: 794 / 2 = 397

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - We aim to distribute items such that the total valuation for each agent is as close as possible to their fair share of 397, while also ensuring envy-freeness.

4. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Start with the highest value items for each agent to maximize their individual valuations.

5. **Reevaluation and Adjustment:**
   - Adjust allocations to ensure that each agent's total value is as close to their fair share as possible.

Considering these steps, here is a possible allocation:

- Allocate items to Agent 0 that maximize their valuation, keeping in mind the fair share target.
- Allocate items to Agent 1 similarly.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 6, giving them a total value of 82 + 98 + 81 = 261.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving them a total value of 84 + 99 + 94 + 3 = 280.

The allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair portion of the items based on their valuations while maintaining envy-freeness. Each agent has items that they value highly, and the total number of items allocated is 7, meeting the problem's requirements.
