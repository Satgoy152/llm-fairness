Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  66  70  41   5  58  93
1   3  67  72   0  18  68  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to each item. A fair allocation would ideally be one where neither agent envies the other's allocation, which generally means trying to maximize each agent's total valuation given the items they receive. Here, we'll attempt to make the allocation as envy-free as possible.

Let's evaluate the total valuations for each agent if they receive different combinations of items. We'll use a simple heuristic to start with: assign each item to the agent who values it more. If this leads to an unbalanced allocation in terms of the number of items, we may need to adjust.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 values it at 3.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 values it at 67.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 values it at 72.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 values it at 0.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 values it at 18.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 68.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

7. **Item 6:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 values it at 56.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

### Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 4, 5]

Checking the allocations:
- Agent 0's total valuation = 40 + 41 + 93 = 174
- Agent 1's total valuation = 67 + 72 + 18 + 68 = 225

This allocation is reasonably fair as it maximizes each agent's valuation for the items they receive without any straightforward envy-free redistribution.

### Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
