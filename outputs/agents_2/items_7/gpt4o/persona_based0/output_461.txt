Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  23  36  55  45  34  49
1  23  71  36  16  85  49  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [90, 23, 36, 55, 45, 34, 49]
- Agent 1's valuations: [23, 71, 36, 16, 85, 49, 18]

We'll try to allocate the items such that each agent maximizes their satisfaction, subject to the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify high-value items per agent**: Each agent should receive the items they value significantly higher than the other agent, if possible.

2. **Balance the total value**: Try to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

3. **Consider envy-freeness**: Ensure that neither agent perceives the other as having a better allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation

1. **Agent 0 prefers item 0**: Assign item 0 to Agent 0 since they value it the highest (90 vs. 23).

2. **Agent 1 prefers item 1**: Assign item 1 to Agent 1 since they value it significantly higher (71 vs. 23).

3. **Agent 1 prefers item 4**: Assign item 4 to Agent 1 since they value it higher (85 vs. 45).

4. **Agent 0 prefers item 3**: Assign item 3 to Agent 0 since they value it higher (55 vs. 16).

5. **Agent 0 prefers item 6**: Assign item 6 to Agent 0 since they value it higher (49 vs. 18).

6. **Agent 1 prefers item 5**: Assign item 5 to Agent 1 since they value it higher (49 vs. 34).

7. **Item 2 is equally valued**: Both agents value item 2 equally (36), but since Agent 0 currently has a higher total value, allocate item 2 to Agent 1 to balance the allocation.

### Final Allocation

The final allocations, considering the steps above, are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 4, 5

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and the allocation is as balanced and envy-free as possible given the constraints.
