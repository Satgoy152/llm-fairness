Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  76  98  66  85  94  96
1   0  20  63   8  22  85  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or as close to envy-free allocation as possible. This means we want each agent to feel that they have received an allocation at least as good as the other agent's allocation based on their valuations.

First, we'll look at the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 56 + 76 + 98 + 66 + 85 + 94 + 96 = 571
- Agent 1's total valuation: 0 + 20 + 63 + 8 + 22 + 85 + 75 = 273

Next, we will use these valuations to make an initial allocation by maximizing each agent's perceived value while ensuring that the allocation is fair.

**Initial Allocation Strategy:**

1. Sort the items by the difference in valuations between the two agents. This helps in identifying items that one agent values significantly more than the other, which can guide the allocation.
2. Allocate items to the agents based on who values them more, considering the need to ensure each agent gets a fair share of their total valuation.

**Allocation Steps:**

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 56, and Agent 1 values it at 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 76, and Agent 1 values it at 20. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 98, and Agent 1 values it at 63. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 66, and Agent 1 values it at 8. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 85, and Agent 1 values it at 22. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 94, and Agent 1 values it at 85. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 96, and Agent 1 values it at 75. Allocate to Agent 1.

**Final Allocation:**

Based on the above strategy, we aim to ensure a fair distribution relative to each agent's valuations. After evaluating the allocations to satisfy as close to envy-freeness as possible, we arrive at the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value for each agent, given their respective valuations, and ensures that all items are allocated.
