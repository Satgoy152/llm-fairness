Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  88  13  46  89  62  31
1  36  25  60  63  37  29  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [36 25 60 63 37 29 58]]
Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocation of the other agent.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

Agent 0's total valuation:
- 55 + 88 + 13 + 46 + 89 + 62 + 31 = 384

Agent 1's total valuation:
- 36 + 25 + 60 + 63 + 37 + 29 + 58 = 308

Given these valuations, we can try to allocate the items such that both agents feel satisfied with their allocation.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - For Agent 0, the highest valued items are: 4 (89), 1 (88), 5 (62).
   - For Agent 1, the highest valued items are: 3 (63), 2 (60), 6 (58).

2. **Allocate Based on Each Agentâ€™s Preferences:**
   - Assign item 4 and item 1 to Agent 0. These are high-value items for Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 and item 2 to Agent 1. These are high-value items for Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - After allocating high-value items, the remaining items are 0, 5, and 6.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0, who values it at 55, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 36.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0, who values it at 62, compared to Agent 1's valuation of 29.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1, who values it at 58, compared to Agent 0's valuation of 31.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 4, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 3, and 6.

The allocations are made such that both agents receive items they value highly, ensuring a fair division.
