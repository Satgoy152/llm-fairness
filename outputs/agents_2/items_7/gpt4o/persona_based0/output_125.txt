Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  44  80  65  51  98  97
1  67  57  51  59  89  21  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 51 + 44 + 80 + 65 + 51 + 98 + 97 = 486
- Agent 1: 67 + 57 + 51 + 59 + 89 + 21 + 54 = 398

Since each agent must receive an integer number of items, and we have 7 items in total, we can aim for both agents to perceive their allocation as fair relative to their valuations.

Let's consider a possible allocation:

### Allocation Process

1. **Assign the highest valued item for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most (value 98).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (value 89).

2. **Continue allocation based on decreasing value:**
   - Agent 0's next highest values: item 6 (97), item 2 (80).
   - Agent 1's next highest values: item 0 (67), item 1 (57).

3. **Remaining items:**
   - Agent 0: Items [3] with value 65.
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 3] are already considered. Item 6 is taken by Agent 0.

4. **Finalize allocation by alternating selections to maintain balance:**
   - Agent 0: [5, 6, 2] (Value: 98 + 97 + 80 = 275)
   - Agent 1: [4, 0, 1, 3] (Value: 89 + 67 + 57 + 59 = 272)

This allocation balances the total perceived value between both agents as closely as possible while ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items.

### Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 2],
    "1": [4, 0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, the total value is balanced as closely as possible, and the allocation is envy-free given the constraints of integer allocations.
