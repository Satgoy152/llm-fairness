Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  59  69  69  85  76  76
1  84  92  99  24  84  56  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item. A common approach to ensure fairness is to aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, where each agent feels that their allocation is as good as or better than the other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's examine the agents' preferences and find an allocation that tries to optimize fairness:

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: [50, 59, 69, 69, 85, 76, 76]
- **Agent 1**: [84, 92, 99, 24, 84, 56, 63]

### Steps to Achieve Fair Allocation:
1. Identify items with significant valuation differences between agents to minimize envy.
2. Allocate items that are more valuable to one agent and less to the other, ensuring a balance in total valuation received by each agent.

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest, while **Agent 1** has equal valuation for item 0 and 4. We should assign item 4 to **Agent 0**.
- **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest. Assign item 2 to **Agent 1**.
- Next, allocate item 1 to **Agent 1** since it has a much higher valuation for it compared to **Agent 0**.
- Item 0, though slightly favored by **Agent 1**, should be given to **Agent 0** to balance the distribution.
- Allocate item 5 to **Agent 0** since **Agent 1** has a lower valuation for it.
- Allocate item 3 to **Agent 0** as it is valued higher by **Agent 0**.
- Allocate item 6 to **Agent 1** to balance the total number of items.

### Resulting Allocation:
This allocation attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 4, 5, 3]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 2, 6]

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, with a focus on minimizing envy by considering the agents' valuations.
