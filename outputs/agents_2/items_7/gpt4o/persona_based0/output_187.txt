Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  49  25   1  14  29  67
1   1  45  10  99  94  77   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[60 49 25  1 14 29 67]
 [ 1 45 10 99 94 77  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, taking into account the valuations provided. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent feels they have received a bundle of items at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle, according to their own valuation.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  49  25   1  14  29  67
1   1  45  10  99  94  77   9
```

Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 6, while Agent 1 highly values items 3, 4, and 5. The goal is to allocate these items such that each agent receives items they value highly while minimizing potential envy.

One potential allocation strategy is to give Agent 0 items they value highly and Agent 1 items they value highly. Let's proceed with this allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0, 1, and 6.
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 60 (item 0) + 49 (item 1) + 67 (item 6) = 176

- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 10 (item 2) + 99 (item 3) + 94 (item 4) + 77 (item 5) = 280

This allocation gives each agent a significant portion of their highly valued items and keeps the total number of items allocated equal to 7.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
