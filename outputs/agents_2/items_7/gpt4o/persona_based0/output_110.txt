Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  18  25  69  43  11  29
1  60  77  89  43  76  44  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[64 18 25 69 43 11 29]
 [60 77 89 43 76 44 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-free division, we should consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that neither feels envious of the other's allocation.

Let's analyze the table of valuations:

```
Agent 0 Valuations: [64, 18, 25, 69, 43, 11, 29]
Agent 1 Valuations: [60, 77, 89, 43, 76, 44, 76]
```

To begin, we can assign items where each agent has a significantly higher valuation compared to the other agent's valuation:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values this item at 89, much higher than agent 0's valuation of 25.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item at 77, compared to agent 0's valuation of 18.
3. **Item 6**: Both agents value this item highly, but agent 1's valuation of 76 is slightly higher than agent 0's valuation of 29.
4. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this at 64, compared to agent 1's valuation of 60.
5. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this at 69, compared to agent 1's valuation of 43.
6. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this at 76, compared to agent 0's valuation of 43.
7. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values this at 44, compared to agent 0's valuation of 11.

This initial allocation can be adjusted to balance the total valuation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, and 4, which they value at 64, 69, and 43, respectively. This gives agent 0 a total valuation of 176.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 5, and 6, which they value at 77, 89, 44, and 76, respectively. This gives agent 1 a total valuation of 286.

To achieve a fairer division, let's adjust the allocation:

1. **Switch item 4 and item 5**: This adjustment improves balance by moving an item with a higher valuation for agent 0 to their allocation.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, 5, which they value at 64, 69, and 11, respectively. This gives agent 0 a total valuation of 144.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 4, 6, which they value at 77, 89, 76, and 76, respectively. This gives agent 1 a total valuation of 318.

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations while considering individual preferences, making it as envy-free as possible given the discrete nature of item allocation.

Final JSON with allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
