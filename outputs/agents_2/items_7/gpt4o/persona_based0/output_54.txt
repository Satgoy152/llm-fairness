Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  58  53  51  16  41  42
1  36  63  16  21  67   1  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free if possible, or at least minimizes envy. An allocation is envy-free if each agent values their own bundle of items at least as much as the other agent values their bundle.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and aim to allocate items such that the perceived value is as close to equal for both agents as possible.

Agent 0's total valuation:
- \(65 + 58 + 53 + 51 + 16 + 41 + 42 = 326\)

Agent 1's total valuation:
- \(36 + 63 + 16 + 21 + 67 + 1 + 40 = 244\)

Let's aim to divide the items such that each agent receives approximately half of the total valuation according to their own perception.

- Half of Agent 0's total valuation: \(163\)
- Half of Agent 1's total valuation: \(122\)

To allocate the items, let's prioritize giving items to each agent based on which items they value more. We will start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent until we get close to these target valuations.

### Allocation Strategy

#### Step 1: Allocate high-value items to Agent 0
1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 65)
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 58)
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 53)

Current total for Agent 0: \(65 + 58 + 53 = 176\)

#### Step 2: Allocate high-value items to Agent 1
1. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 67)
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 63)

Current total for Agent 1: \(67 + 63 = 130\)

#### Step 3: Allocate remaining items to minimize envy
Agent 0: 176
Agent 1: 130

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 21)

Current total for Agent 1: \(130 + 21 = 151\)

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 41)

Current total for Agent 0: \(176 + 41 = 217\)

- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 40)

Final total for Agent 1: \(151 + 40 = 191\)

### Final Allocations

Now, let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value for each agent as closely as possible, given their different valuations of the items.
