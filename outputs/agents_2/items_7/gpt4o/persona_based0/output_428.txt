Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  91  34  38  45  68  61
1  85  93  29  35  76  47  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that both agents perceive their allocation as fair based on their own valuations. A common approach is to attempt to minimize envy, which means we try to allocate items such that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they would value the allocation of the other agent.

Let's first examine the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(26 + 91 + 34 + 38 + 45 + 68 + 61 = 363\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(85 + 93 + 29 + 35 + 76 + 47 + 70 = 435\)

To divide the items fairly, we can aim for each agent to receive items whose total valuation is proportional to their total valuation of all items. We want to allocate items such that the value perceived by each agent is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Initial Item Allocation:**
   - Start by allocating items with the highest value for each agent, ensuring that they don't overlap unless necessary.

2. **Balancing Value:**
   - Adjust allocations to ensure that the total perceived value by each agent is as close as possible.

Following this strategy:

- **Agent 0** values item 1 the most (91), so we start by giving agent 0 this item.
- **Agent 1** values item 1 the most (93), but since agent 0 already took item 1, we give agent 1 the next best item, which is item 0 (85).

Continuing this way while balancing:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 5 (total value = 159)
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 6 (total value = 155)

Remaining items to allocate: 2, 3, 4

- Allocate item 2 to agent 0 (value = 34 for agent 0, total now = 193)
- Allocate item 3 to agent 1 (value = 35 for agent 1, total now = 190)
- Allocate item 4 to agent 1 (value = 76 for agent 1, total now = 266)

Finally, allocate the remaining item:

- Allocate item 4 to agent 0, balancing the total value further (value = 45 for agent 0, total now = 238)

With these allocations, both agents should feel that they have received a fair share relative to their valuations.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 6, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and both agents receive a fair share according to their respective valuations.
