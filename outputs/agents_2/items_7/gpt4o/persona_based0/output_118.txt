Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  76  28  28  58  95  30
1   3  53  90  20  12   3  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[34 76 28 28 58 95 30]
 [ 3 53 90 20 12  3 79]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over the allocation of the other agent based on their valuations.

Let's go through the valuation table:

```
Agent 0: [34, 76, 28, 28, 58, 95, 30]
Agent 1: [3, 53, 90, 20, 12, 3, 79]
```

For each item, we want to assign it to the agent who values it more, to maximize the overall satisfaction.

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 values it at 3. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 values it at 53. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 values it at 90. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 values it at 20. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 12. Allocate to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 values it at 3. Allocate to Agent 0.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 30, Agent 1 values it at 79. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1, 3, 4, 5].
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 6].

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 34 + 76 + 28 + 58 + 95 = 291 and Agent 1 a total value of 90 + 79 = 169.

This allocation maximizes the value for both agents given their preferences for individual items.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 6]
}
```
