Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  75  64   1  51  83  64
1  53  43  64  41  81  34  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as the allocation of any other agent.

Let's summarize the total valuations of each agent for all items:

- Agent 0: \(10 + 75 + 64 + 1 + 51 + 83 + 64 = 348\)
- Agent 1: \(53 + 43 + 64 + 41 + 81 + 34 + 23 = 339\)

Our goal is to allocate items such that both agents are satisfied with their respective bundles, minimizing any potential envy.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Maximize Each Agent's Perceived Value:**
   - We'll start by allocating items so that each agent has a high total value from their perspective.

2. **Avoid Envy:**
   - Ensure that neither agent would prefer the allocation of the other.

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:**
  - Agent 0 highly values items 1 (75) and 5 (83).
  
- **Agent 1:**
  - Agent 1 highly values items 4 (81) and 2 (64).

After considering the next highest valued items for each agent, we can complete the allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 1, 5, 0, 6
  - Total value for Agent 0: \(75 + 83 + 10 + 64 = 232\)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 4, 2, 3
  - Total value for Agent 1: \(81 + 64 + 41 = 186\)

Both agents receive allocations that maximize their perceived value and minimize envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 0, 6],
    "1": [4, 2, 3]
}
```
