Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  67  75  81   8  83  34
1  21  82  14  91  87   7  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers the other's allocation over their own. We will consider the valuations and attempt to balance the total value perceived by each agent.

**Agent Valuations:**

- Agent 0 values: [88, 67, 75, 81, 8, 83, 34]
- Agent 1 values: [21, 82, 14, 91, 87, 7, 22]

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0's Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (value 88)

2. **Agent 1's Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (value 91)

3. **Next Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 prefers Item 5 (value 83)
   - Agent 1 prefers Item 4 (value 87)

4. **Continuing with Remaining High Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (value 67)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (value 14)

5. **Distributing Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0: Item 6 (value 34)
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (value 7)

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Agent 1 gets items: 3, 4, 2

This allocation balances the perceived values, taking into account the highest possible preferences for each agent without causing envy.

**JSON Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, both agents receive a set of items that they value highly relative to their own preferences, aiming to reduce envy as much as possible given the constraints.
