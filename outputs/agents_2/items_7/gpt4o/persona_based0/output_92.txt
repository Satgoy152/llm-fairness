Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  94   0  63  27  15  78
1  30  56  97  14   6   1  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between agents in a manner that takes into account their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free (if possible) or at least approximately envy-free. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations:

Agent 0:  
Item 0: 60  
Item 1: 94  
Item 2: 0  
Item 3: 63  
Item 4: 27  
Item 5: 15  
Item 6: 78  

Agent 1:  
Item 0: 30  
Item 1: 56  
Item 2: 97  
Item 3: 14  
Item 4: 6  
Item 5: 1  
Item 6: 55  

To achieve a fair allocation, we can try to maximize the total utility for each agent while ensuring that each gets a fair share of the total value of all items. Here is a step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 60 + 94 + 0 + 63 + 27 + 15 + 78 = 337
   - Agent 1: 30 + 56 + 97 + 14 + 6 + 1 + 55 = 259

2. Calculate the fair share of each agent based on total valuation:
   - Total value of all items: 337 + 259 = 596
   - Fair share for Agent 0: 596 * (337/596) = 337 (since Agent 0's total valuation is 337)
   - Fair share for Agent 1: 596 * (259/596) = 259 (since Agent 1's total valuation is 259)

3. Allocate items by attempting to get as close to each agent's fair share as possible, while ensuring no envy:

   - Assign items with the highest relative value to each agent based on their valuations:
     - Agent 0: Item 1 (94), Item 3 (63), Item 6 (78)  
     - Agent 1: Item 2 (97), Item 0 (30), Item 5 (1), Item 4 (6)

4. Adjust allocation to ensure all items are allocated and no items are left out. This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives without envy:

   - Agent 0 receives items: [1, 3, 6] with total valuation: 94 + 63 + 78 = 235
   - Agent 1 receives items: [2, 0, 5, 4] with total valuation: 97 + 30 + 1 + 6 = 134

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free, but it attempts to balance the values each agent receives based on their preferences.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 0, 5, 4]
}
```
