Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  20  90  70  88  71  48
1  45  20  35  79  40  45  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to create an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible given the agents' valuations. We'll attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations for the items.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent places on all items combined:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 88 + 20 + 90 + 70 + 88 + 71 + 48 = 475
- Agent 1's total valuation: 45 + 20 + 35 + 79 + 40 + 45 + 18 = 282

Next, we'll try to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their total valuation. The goal is to make sure the allocation is envy-free, meaning no agent should prefer the allocation of the other agent to their own.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (90), so we'll allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 0 values item 0 and item 4 equally (88 each), so we'll allocate one of these to Agent 0 and the other to Agent 1. Let's give item 0 to Agent 0 and item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Next, Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (79), so we'll allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 0 values item 5 next highest (71), so we'll allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
5. Agent 1 values item 5 next highest (45), but since it's already allocated to Agent 0, we move to the next highest, item 1 (20), and allocate it to Agent 1.
6. The remaining items are item 6 and item 1, with item 6 allocated to Agent 0 and item 1 to Agent 1.

Now let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 2, 5, 6].
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 3, 4].

Both agents have received items, and all items have been allocated. 

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
