Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  29   0  91  50  90   0
1  52  66  74  46  90  83  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider the total valuations each agent places on the items and try to balance them.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 30 + 29 + 0 + 91 + 50 + 90 + 0 = 290
- Agent 1's total valuation: 52 + 66 + 74 + 46 + 90 + 83 + 29 = 440

Given that Agent 1 places a higher total value on the items, we should aim to allocate items such that both agents feel they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

To achieve this, we can try to assign items that have higher value to one agent compared to the other, ensuring that the total perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's consider each item one by one and allocate them strategically:

1. Item 0: Valued at 30 by Agent 0 and 52 by Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1 as it values it more.
2. Item 1: Valued at 29 by Agent 0 and 66 by Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1 as it values it more.
3. Item 2: Valued at 0 by Agent 0 and 74 by Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1 as it values it more.
4. Item 3: Valued at 91 by Agent 0 and 46 by Agent 1. Assign to Agent 0 as it values it more.
5. Item 4: Valued at 50 by Agent 0 and 90 by Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1 as it values it more.
6. Item 5: Valued at 90 by Agent 0 and 83 by Agent 1. Assign to Agent 0 as it values it more.
7. Item 6: Valued at 0 by Agent 0 and 29 by Agent 1. Assign to Agent 1 as it values it more.

Now let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 3, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
