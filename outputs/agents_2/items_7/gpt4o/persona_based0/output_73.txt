Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  56  12  85  28  46  15
1  11  54   8  36  41  47  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness. This means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over that of the other agent, given their valuations of the items.

Let's first examine the total valuations each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 99 + 56 + 12 + 85 + 28 + 46 + 15 = 341
- Agent 1's total valuation: 11 + 54 + 8 + 36 + 41 + 47 + 49 = 246

We will aim to allocate the items so that each agent gets a roughly equal share of their total valuation, and no agent envies the other. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3. These items should preferably go to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values items 5 and 6 relatively highly, so they should go to Agent 1.
3. The remaining items (2 and 4) should be distributed in such a way that maximizes fairness and minimizes envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Allocate items 0, 1, and 3 to Agent 0.
- Allocate items 5 and 6 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it at 41, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 28).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 values it slightly more than Agent 1).

This allocation ensures that both agents get a fair share based on their valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 3, with a total valuation of 99 + 56 + 12 + 85 = 252.
- Agent 1 receives items 4, 5, and 6, with a total valuation of 41 + 47 + 49 = 137.

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5, 6]
}
```
