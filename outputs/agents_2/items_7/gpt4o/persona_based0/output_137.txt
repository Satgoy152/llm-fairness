Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17   5  59  89  82  10  13
1  63  40  88  24  93  27  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free or at least a balanced allocation where each agent's perceived value for their allocated items is as fair as possible given their individual preferences. Let's evaluate the problem:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 17
- Item 1: 5
- Item 2: 59
- Item 3: 89
- Item 4: 82
- Item 5: 10
- Item 6: 13

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 63
- Item 1: 40
- Item 2: 88
- Item 3: 24
- Item 4: 93
- Item 5: 27
- Item 6: 36

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0 total value: 17 + 5 + 59 + 89 + 82 + 10 + 13 = 275
- Agent 1 total value: 63 + 40 + 88 + 24 + 93 + 27 + 36 = 371

Now, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent's perceived value is as balanced as possible.

A possible fair allocation could be:

1. Assign the high-value items for each agent first, trying to balance the total perceived value for each agent.

After testing various allocations, a reasonable allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items: 3, 4, 5, 6
  - Total value for Agent 0: 89 (item 3) + 82 (item 4) + 10 (item 5) + 13 (item 6) = 194

- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 1, 2
  - Total value for Agent 1: 63 (item 0) + 40 (item 1) + 88 (item 2) = 191

Now, both agents have a similar total value from their respective allocations, which is quite balanced given their preferences.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
