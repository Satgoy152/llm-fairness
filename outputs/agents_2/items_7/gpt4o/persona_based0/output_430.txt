Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1  2   3   4   5   6
0  87   2  8  55  55  61  72
1  94  98  2  13  13   6   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 98  2 13 13  6  0]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should prefer their allocation over the other's allocation based on their valuations. Additionally, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

First, let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [87, 2, 8, 55, 55, 61, 72]
- Agent 1's valuations: [94, 98, 2, 13, 13, 6, 0]

To achieve a fair allocation, we will attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their most valued items. We will start by allocating the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most.

1. Item 1 is most valued by Agent 1 (98 vs. 2), allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
2. Item 0 is most valued by Agent 1 (94 vs. 87), allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Item 6 is most valued by Agent 0 (72 vs. 0), allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
4. Item 5 is most valued by Agent 0 (61 vs. 6), allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
5. Item 3 is most valued by Agent 0 (55 vs. 13), allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
6. Item 4 is most valued by Agent 0 (55 vs. 13), allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
7. Item 2 is equally low-valued by both agents but slightly more by Agent 0 (8 vs. 2), allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items [6, 5, 3, 4, 2], with valuations [72, 61, 55, 55, 8] respectively.
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 0], with valuations [98, 94] respectively.

This allocation respects the need for integer item division and attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent the items they value more highly.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
