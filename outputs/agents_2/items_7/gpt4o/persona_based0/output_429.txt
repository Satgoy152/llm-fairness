Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  87  21  66  40  55  40
1  49  15   0  70  77  58  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's begin by looking at the data:

- Agent 0's valuations: [25, 87, 21, 66, 40, 55, 40]
- Agent 1's valuations: [49, 15,  0, 70, 77, 58, 13]

We'll attempt to allocate the items by maximizing the total value each agent receives, aiming to minimize envy. Here's a strategy to achieve a balanced allocation:

1. **Sort items by value for each agent:**  
   - For Agent 0: [1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 0, 2]
   - For Agent 1: [4, 3, 5, 0, 6, 1, 2]

2. **Start by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent:**  
   - Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 87)  
   - Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 77)  

3. **Continue allocating items by alternating preference:**  
   - Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 66)  
   - Agent 1 gets item 5 (value 58)  

4. **Balance the remaining items:**  
   - Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 25)  
   - Agent 1 gets item 6 (value 13)  
   - Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 21)  

This allocation attempts to distribute items by maximizing each agent's satisfaction. The total value for each agent should be relatively balanced.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 7 items, with each agent getting an integer number of items, while trying to maintain fairness based on their preferences.
