Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  71  79  72   8  30  97
1  56  21  84  53  33   2  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free or approximately envy-free division. An envy-free allocation means that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as the bundle received by any other agent, given the constraints.

One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or ensuring that each agent gets a bundle that they value at least as much as any other bundle they might envy.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [67, 71, 79, 72, 8, 30, 97]
- Agent 1's valuations: [56, 21, 84, 53, 33, 2, 60]

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0 = 67 + 71 + 79 + 72 + 8 + 30 + 97 = 424
- Total value for Agent 1 = 56 + 21 + 84 + 53 + 33 + 2 + 60 = 309

We will attempt to construct an allocation that is fair or approximately fair:

1. Allocate items 0, 1, and 6 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values these at 67 + 71 + 97 = 235
   - Agent 1 values these at 56 + 21 + 60 = 137

2. Allocate items 2, 3, 4, and 5 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0 values these at 79 + 72 + 8 + 30 = 189
   - Agent 1 values these at 84 + 53 + 33 + 2 = 172

Both Agents receive a fairly valued set of items, with Agent 0 receiving items they value higher overall, which is balanced by Agent 1 receiving more items.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
