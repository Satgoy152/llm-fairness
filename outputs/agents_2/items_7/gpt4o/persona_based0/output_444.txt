Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  72  36  54  73  67  26
1   6  32  55  78   1  24  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6 32 55 78  1 24 83]]
Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution, where each agent feels that they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. We will consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to allocate them in a way that minimizes envy.

Let's examine the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations: [91, 72, 36, 54, 73, 67, 26]  
Agent 1's valuations: [6, 32, 55, 78, 1, 24, 83]

### Steps:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 (91) the most, followed by item 4 (73).
   - Agent 1 values item 6 (83) the most, followed by item 3 (78).

2. **Allocate Top-Valued Items First:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 and item 6 to Agent 1 as these are their highest-valued items.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Consider the next highest-valued items for each agent while ensuring as fair a division as possible.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 and item 3 to Agent 1 as they are the next highest-valued items for each.

4. **Distribute Remaining Items to Balance the Allocation:**
   - The remaining items are: 1, 2, 5.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 (72) highly, so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 (55) more than Agent 0, so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Finally, Agent 0 values item 5 (67) more than Agent 1, so assign item 5 to Agent 0.

This allocation aims to balance the total value received by each agent based on their individual valuations. 

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.
