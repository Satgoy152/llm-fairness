Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  56  54  36  60  42  77
1  13  24  43  83  86  88  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[34 56 54 36 60 42 77]
 [13 24 43 83 86 88 30]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the 7 items between the 2 agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations to determine a fair allocation:

### Valuations Table:
- **Agent 0**: [34, 56, 54, 36, 60, 42, 77]
- **Agent 1**: [13, 24, 43, 83, 86, 88, 30]

### Total Value:
- **Agent 0 Total Value**: 34 + 56 + 54 + 36 + 60 + 42 + 77 = 359
- **Agent 1 Total Value**: 13 + 24 + 43 + 83 + 86 + 88 + 30 = 367

### Greedy Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign items based on the highest value difference between agents to minimize envy.
2. Start with the item that has the highest absolute difference in valuation between the two agents.

### Allocation Process:
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 86, Agent 0 at 60. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 88, Agent 0 at 42. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 83, Agent 0 at 36. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 at 30. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 at 24. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 at 13. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 at 43. Assign to Agent 0.

### Resulting Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: [0, 1, 2, 6]
- **Agent 1**: [3, 4, 5]

This allocation seeks to distribute the items such that both agents receive a fair share according to their valuations while also attempting to minimize envy.

### Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
