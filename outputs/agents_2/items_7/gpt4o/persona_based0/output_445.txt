Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  66  73  96  68  88  58
1  90  74  30  97  61  23  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider how each agent values the items and try to maximize each agent's utility while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations:  
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 66
  - Item 2: 73
  - Item 3: 96
  - Item 4: 68
  - Item 5: 88
  - Item 6: 58

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 30
  - Item 3: 97
  - Item 4: 61
  - Item 5: 23
  - Item 6: 43

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize the sum of the valuations for each agent while ensuring that no agent is envious of the other's allocation. We can use a method like the "round robin" allocation or simply try a systematic approach that ensures fairness.

Let's consider a possible allocation:

1. Start by allocating the item with the highest valuation for each agent, alternating between them.

2. Continue allocating items in a way that tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation outcome:

- Agent 0:
  - Items: 0, 1, 5
  - Total valuation: 34 (Item 0) + 66 (Item 1) + 88 (Item 5) = 188

- Agent 1:
  - Items: 2, 3, 4, 6
  - Total valuation: 30 (Item 2) + 97 (Item 3) + 61 (Item 4) + 43 (Item 6) = 231

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
