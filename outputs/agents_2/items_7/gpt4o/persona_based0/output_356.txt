Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  30  73  53  80  65  95
1   8  87  65  53  71  28  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 8 87 65 53 71 28 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their valuations. A common approach to achieve this is the envy-free criterion, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's compare the valuations and attempt to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy:

Agent 0's valuations: [70, 30, 73, 53, 80, 65, 95]  
Agent 1's valuations: [8, 87, 65, 53, 71, 28, 15]

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Identify highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 6 highest (95).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 highest (87).

2. **Start allocation with these preferences:**
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Continue with next highest preferences, considering remaining items:**
   - Agent 0's next highest available is item 4 (80).
   - Agent 1's next highest available is item 2 (65).

4. **Allocate these preferences:**
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

5. **Review remaining items and valuations:**
   - Remaining items: [0, 3, 5]
   - Agent 0's valuations: [70, 53, 65] (for items 0, 3, 5)
   - Agent 1's valuations: [8, 53, 28] (for items 0, 3, 5)

6. **Allocate remaining items considering fairness:**
   - Allocate item 0 (70) to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 (53) to Agent 1.

7. **One item left: item 5**
   - Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 values it at 28.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0 receives items [6, 4, 0, 5].
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 2, 3].

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value for each agent and minimize envy.

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4, 0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
