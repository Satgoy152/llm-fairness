Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  36  93   6  27  56  54
1  61  10  63  77   2  15  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will consider each agent's valuation for the items. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 35 + 36 + 93 + 6 + 27 + 56 + 54 = 307
- Agent 1's total value: 61 + 10 + 63 + 77 + 2 + 15 + 67 = 295

Next, we will allocate the items such that each agent receives items with a total valuation as close to half of their total valuation as possible, aiming for each to feel they have received a fair share.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. Sort each agent's valuations by descending order:

   - Agent 0: [93, 56, 54, 36, 35, 27, 6]
   - Agent 1: [77, 67, 63, 61, 15, 10, 2]

2. Allocate the highest-valued items by alternating between agents, ensuring that the total value allocated to each agent remains balanced.

After considering the valuations, a fair allocation might be:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (93), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly (77), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 5 (56), so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 (67), so allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 0 (35), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 (63), but it's already allocated, so allocate item 1 (10) to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 4 (27), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation gives us:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 5, 0, 4 (Values: 93, 56, 35, 27 = 211)
- Agent 1: Items 3, 6, 1 (Values: 77, 67, 10 = 154)

This allocation is not entirely balanced, but it respects the agents' valuations as much as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 0, 4],
    "1": [3, 6, 1]
}
```
