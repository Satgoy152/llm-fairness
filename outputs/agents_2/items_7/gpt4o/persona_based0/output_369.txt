Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  5  39   5  48  30  60  51
1  7  67  52  14  40  83  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to take into account their valuations and aim for an envy-free distribution. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent would prefer to have the allocation of another agent given their own valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve an envy-free allocation:

1. **List the Valuations:**

   - Agent 0's valuations: [5, 39, 5, 48, 30, 60, 51]
   - Agent 1's valuations: [7, 67, 52, 14, 40, 83, 11]

2. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**

   - Total value for Agent 0: 5 + 39 + 5 + 48 + 30 + 60 + 51 = 238
   - Total value for Agent 1: 7 + 67 + 52 + 14 + 40 + 83 + 11 = 274

3. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0 values item 5 (60) and item 3 (48) highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 (83) and item 1 (67) highly.

4. **Allocate High-Value Items:**

   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 since they value it the highest.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 since they value it highly and Agent 1 values it less.

5. **Distribute Remaining Items to Balance the Allocation:**

   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (valued at 67 by Agent 1, higher than Agent 0's 39).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (valued at 51 by Agent 0, higher than Agent 1's 11).

6. **Allocate the Remaining Items:**

   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (valued at 40 by Agent 1, higher than Agent 0's 30).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (valued at 7 by Agent 1, higher than Agent 0's 5).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (valued at 5 by both agents, but Agent 0 needs more items).

Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: [2, 3, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 4, 5]

This allocation ensures both agents receive items they value highly, minimizing envy between them.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5]
}
```
