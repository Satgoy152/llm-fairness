Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4  5   6
0  79  61  51  25  27  7  13
1   4  67  16  62  41  1  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method like the adjusted winner procedure or a simple heuristic approach to balance the value distribution as perceived by each agent. In this case, we'll focus on balancing the total value of items allocated to each agent based on their individual valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to finding a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: First, calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items.

   - Agent 0's total valuation: 79 + 61 + 51 + 25 + 27 + 7 + 13 = 263
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 4 + 67 + 16 + 62 + 41 + 1 + 87 = 278

2. **Initial Allocation**: Start by allocating items greedily based on the highest valuation difference between the two agents. This prioritizes giving each item to the agent who values it more.

3. **Allocation Process**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (79 vs. 4), allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (67 vs. 61), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (51 vs. 16), allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (62 vs. 25), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (41 vs. 27), allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (7 vs. 1), allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (87 vs. 13), allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Check Fairness**: Evaluate the total valuation of items for each agent after the allocation:

   - Agent 0's allocated items: [0, 2, 5] with total valuation = 79 + 51 + 7 = 137
   - Agent 1's allocated items: [1, 3, 4, 6] with total valuation = 67 + 62 + 41 + 87 = 257

5. **Adjust for Fairness**: The allocation is heavily skewed towards Agent 1 in terms of perceived value. To address this, we need to adjust to make the allocation more balanced. Swap items to balance perceived values:

   - Swap item 4 (Agent 1) and item 5 (Agent 0):
     - New Agent 0's allocation: [0, 2, 4] with total valuation = 79 + 51 + 27 = 157
     - New Agent 1's allocation: [1, 3, 5, 6] with total valuation = 67 + 62 + 1 + 87 = 217

This allocation reduces envy and provides a more balanced distribution of perceived value.

**Final Allocation**:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
