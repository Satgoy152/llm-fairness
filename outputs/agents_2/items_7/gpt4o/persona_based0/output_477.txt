Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  95  68  54  33  28  37
1  35  33  78  90   8   4  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while taking into account their valuation of each item, we want to ensure that each agent feels that they are receiving at least as much value as they would expect. This process aims to achieve an envy-free allocation, if possible.

To begin, let's consider each agent's total valuation of all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(49 + 95 + 68 + 54 + 33 + 28 + 37 = 364\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(35 + 33 + 78 + 90 + 8 + 4 + 76 = 324\)

The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that both agents receive a set of items with a perceived fair share of the total value.

A straightforward approach is to use a method known as the "Greedy Envy-Free Allocation," which involves considering each item in decreasing order of its value to each agent, and assigning it to the agent who values it more, as long as it maintains or improves envy-freeness.

Let's analyze the valuation of each item and proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 95 and Agent 1 at 33. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 54 and Agent 1 at 90. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 68 and Agent 1 at 78. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 49 and Agent 1 at 35. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
5. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 37 and Agent 1 at 76. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
6. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 33 and Agent 1 at 8. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
7. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 28 and Agent 1 at 4. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value more, which can help minimize envy. Now, let's verify the total valuation for each agent with their assigned items:

- Agent 0's items: [1, 0, 4, 5] with total valuation \(95 + 49 + 33 + 28 = 205\)
- Agent 1's items: [3, 2, 6] with total valuation \(90 + 78 + 76 = 244\)

Now, presenting the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 4, 5],
    "1": [3, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation results in each agent getting items with valuations that are reflective of their preferences, and it attempts to achieve fairness by distributing higher-valued items according to individual valuations.
