Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66   0   7  24  48  55  23
1  30  79  40  64  58  27  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an envy-free allocation as much as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where each agent believes they have received at least as much value as any other agent, according to their own valuations.

Let's evaluate the total valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0's total valuation**: 66 + 0 + 7 + 24 + 48 + 55 + 23 = 223
- **Agent 1's total valuation**: 30 + 79 + 40 + 64 + 58 + 27 + 18 = 316

Next, we will try to allocate items in a way that balances the allocated values for both agents. One potential approach is to allocate items by maximizing each agentâ€™s perceived value.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**'s highest valuation:
   - Item 0 (value 66)
   - Item 5 (value 55)
   - Item 4 (value 48)

2. **Agent 1**'s highest valuation:
   - Item 1 (value 79)
   - Item 3 (value 64)
   - Item 2 (value 40)

3. After allocating the above, item 6 remains. We allocate it to Agent 0 to balance the allocations since Agent 0 has a lower overall valuation.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0** receives items [0, 5, 4, 6] with total value: 66 + 55 + 48 + 23 = 192
- **Agent 1** receives items [1, 3, 2] with total value: 79 + 64 + 40 = 183

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value received by each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 2]
}
```
