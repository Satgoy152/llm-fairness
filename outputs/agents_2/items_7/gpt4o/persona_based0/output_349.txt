Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  60  91  28  37  23  12
1  35  42  75  82  82  65  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly between the two agents, we need to ensure that both agents receive a fair share of the total value according to their own valuations, aiming to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. 

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 63 + 60 + 91 + 28 + 37 + 23 + 12 = 314
- Agent 1's total valuation: 35 + 42 + 75 + 82 + 82 + 65 + 59 = 440

Next, we'll calculate the proportion of the total value each agent perceives over all items:

- Agent 0's proportion: 314 / (314 + 440) ≈ 0.416
- Agent 1's proportion: 440 / (314 + 440) ≈ 0.584

Given there are 7 items, ideally, Agent 0 should receive approximately 7 * 0.416 ≈ 2.912 items, and Agent 1 should receive approximately 7 * 0.584 ≈ 4.088 items.

Let's proceed with an allocation that approximates these proportions while attempting to minimize envy. We can do this by allocating items with the highest value to each agent according to their own valuations:

1. Allocate the highest-valued items for each agent:
   - For Agent 0: The highest values are for items 2 (91), and 0 (63).
   - For Agent 1: The highest values are for items 4 (82), 3 (82), and 2 (75).

2. Avoid double allocation of items and adjust:
   - Agent 0 can take items 2 and 0. 
   - Agent 1 can take items 4, 3, and 5.

3. Now allocate the remaining items (1, 6):
   - Agent 0: Take item 1 (60), which is higher for Agent 0 than Agent 1.
   - Agent 1: Take item 6 (59), which is higher for Agent 1 than Agent 0.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 0, 1
- Agent 1: Items 4, 3, 5, 6

This allocation gives both agents a fair share of items according to their valuations and minimizes potential envy.

}
