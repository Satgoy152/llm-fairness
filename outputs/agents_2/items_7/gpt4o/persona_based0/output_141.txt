Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  39  51  37  68  11  14
1  86  21  35  96  12  12  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the two agents, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent's share is proportional to their valuations, ideally leading to an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation. The goal is to maximize each agent's perceived total value while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0's total value: 77 + 39 + 51 + 37 + 68 + 11 + 14 = 297
- Agent 1's total value: 86 + 21 + 35 + 96 + 12 + 12 + 72 = 334

To achieve fairness, each agent should ideally receive items that maximize their total perceived value, considering their individual preferences.

We'll proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Prioritize items with the highest values: 0 (77), 4 (68), 2 (51)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Prioritize items with the highest values: 3 (96), 0 (86), 6 (72)

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 is allocated items: 0, 2, 4
- Agent 1 is allocated items: 1, 3, 5, 6

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation method prioritizes each agent's highest-valued items while ensuring that all items are distributed between the two agents, aiming for an envy-free division based on their valuations.
