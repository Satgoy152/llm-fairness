Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  10  59  99  74  81  51
1  60  23  32  64  21  84  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation given to the other agent based on their individual valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 19 + 10 + 59 + 99 + 74 + 81 + 51 = 393
- Agent 1: 60 + 23 + 32 + 64 + 21 + 84 + 78 = 362

Now, let's try to allocate the items such that each agent ends up with approximately half of their total valuation. The target valuations would be around:

- Agent 0: 393 / 2 ≈ 196.5
- Agent 1: 362 / 2 ≈ 181

We need to distribute the items so that the sum of the values for each agent is close to these target values.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 1 highly values items 0, 5, and 6. Assign items 0, 5, and 6 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1's total value: 60 (item 0) + 84 (item 5) + 78 (item 6) = 222

2. Now, let's assign the remaining items to Agent 0:
   - Items left: 1, 2, 3, 4
   - Agent 0's total value: 10 (item 1) + 59 (item 2) + 99 (item 3) + 74 (item 4) = 242

Now, evaluate if the allocations are close to the targets:

- Agent 0: 242 (close to 196.5)
- Agent 1: 222 (close to 181)

This allocation minimizes envy because each agent gets a bundle of items with a total value close to half of their total valuation of all items. 

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5, 6]
}
```
