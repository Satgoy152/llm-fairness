Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  28  83  31  11  20  37
1   7  13  28  64  90  59  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent should feel that they received a set of items at least as valuable as the set received by the other agent, according to their own valuations.

Let's first summarize the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [58, 28, 83, 31, 11, 20, 37]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [7, 13, 28, 64, 90, 59, 81]

Total value for Agent 0 across all items: 268
Total value for Agent 1 across all items: 342

To minimize envy, we'll try to balance the total value of the items each agent receives according to their own valuations. We'll start by examining the high-value items for each agent.

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items (in descending order):**
   - Item 2: 83
   - Item 0: 58
   - Item 6: 37
   - Item 3: 31
   - Item 1: 28

2. **Agent 1's highest valued items (in descending order):**
   - Item 4: 90
   - Item 6: 81
   - Item 3: 64
   - Item 5: 59
   - Item 2: 28

Considering these preferences, we can start assigning items. We want to ensure both agents feel they receive a fair share of the value based on their valuations.

Let's try the following allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Assign Agent 0 the items: 0, 2, 3
  - Total value for Agent 0 with these items: 58 + 83 + 31 = 172

- **Agent 1**:
  - Assign Agent 1 the items: 1, 4, 5, 6
  - Total value for Agent 1 with these items: 13 + 90 + 59 + 81 = 243

This allocation attempts to balance the value each agent receives. While Agent 1 receives more items, Agent 0 receives higher-valued items according to their preference, which should help in minimizing envy.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
