Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  68   0  12   0  65   2
1  70   1  56  74  93  74  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items that minimizes envy between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [91, 68, 0, 12, 0, 65, 2]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [70, 1, 56, 74, 93, 74, 59]

We can use these valuations to determine a fair allocation by maximizing each agent's total value of the items they receive, while considering the overall fairness of the distribution.

One approach is to allocate items by comparing the valuations of both agents for each item and assigning the item to the agent who values it more, ensuring the overall distribution is fair.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 91, and Agent 1 values it at 70. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 68, and Agent 1 values it at 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 0, and Agent 1 values it at 56. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 12, and Agent 1 values it at 74. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 0, and Agent 1 values it at 93. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 65, and Agent 1 values it at 74. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 2, and Agent 1 values it at 59. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

Based on this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, and Agent 1 receives items 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent the items they value more compared to the other agent, while ensuring that all items are distributed.
