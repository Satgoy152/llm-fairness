Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  19  75  13  32  50  75
1  61  92  64  24  83   2  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent believes they received the best possible allocation from their perspective given their valuations.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(79 + 19 + 75 + 13 + 32 + 50 + 75 = 343\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(61 + 92 + 64 + 24 + 83 + 2 + 25 = 351\)

Next, let's allocate the items to ensure that each agent is as satisfied as possible and the allocation is envy-free.

From Agent 0's perspective, they value items 0, 2, and 6 highly.
From Agent 1's perspective, they value items 1 and 4 highly.

To start the allocation, we can give:

- Agent 0: items 0, 2, and 6
- Agent 1: items 1 and 4

After this allocation, the remaining items are 3 and 5.

Now, we assign the remaining items to balance out the valuations:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it higher than Agent 0)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 1)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that are valuable to them, and the allocation is envy-free given the constraints.

The complete allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This distribution ensures that both agents receive items they value highly, and the allocation is fair based on their preferences.
