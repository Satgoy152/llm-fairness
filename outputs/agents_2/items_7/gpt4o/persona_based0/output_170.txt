Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  63   6  90  12  98  53
1  13  26  38  25  28  21   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy, we should consider the valuations of both agents for each item and aim to distribute the items such that both agents perceive their allocated bundle to be at least as valuable as the other agent's bundle. 

Let's evaluate the situation step by step:

### Agent Valuations:
- **Agent 0's Valuations:** [64, 63, 6, 90, 12, 98, 53]
- **Agent 1's Valuations:** [13, 26, 38, 25, 28, 21, 3]

### Total Valuation:
- **Agent 0's Total Valuation:** 64 + 63 + 6 + 90 + 12 + 98 + 53 = 386
- **Agent 1's Total Valuation:** 13 + 26 + 38 + 25 + 28 + 21 + 3 = 154

To allocate items fairly, we should aim to maximize each agent's valuation of their respective bundle while ensuring the distribution is envy-free.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0:** This agent has a higher valuation for the items, so they should receive more items or more valuable items.
2. **Agent 1:** This agent should receive items such that they perceive their share as close to or exceeding what Agent 0 receives, based on their valuations.

### Propose an Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Highest valued items for Agent 0 are 5, 3, and 0.
- **Agent 1:** Highest valued items for Agent 1 are 2, 4, and 1.

#### Allocated Items:
- Assign item 5, 3, and 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2, 4, and 1 to Agent 1.
- Remaining item 6 can go to Agent 0 for better balance, considering their high valuation for this item.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 their highest valued items and also ensures that Agent 1 gets a fair share based on their valuation, making this allocation envy-free to a reasonable extent.
