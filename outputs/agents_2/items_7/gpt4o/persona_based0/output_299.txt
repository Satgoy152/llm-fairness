Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  30  90  34   2  30  18
1  88  40  21  27  42  15  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 15 + 30 + 90 + 34 + 2 + 30 + 18 = 219
   - Agent 1: 88 + 40 + 21 + 27 + 42 + 15 + 99 = 332

2. **Determine the Proportional Share:**
   - Total value of all items = 219 + 332 = 551
   - Proportional share for Agent 0 = 219 / 551 ≈ 0.397
   - Proportional share for Agent 1 = 332 / 551 ≈ 0.603

3. **Sort Items by Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - For Agent 0 (sorted by value): [2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 0, 4]
   - For Agent 1 (sorted by value): [6, 0, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5]

4. **Allocate Items Using Envy-Free Strategy:**
   - We will use the equitable allocation approach to ensure that each agent receives a share that they value fairly according to their proportional share.

5. **Allocation Process:**
   - Start with the highest-valued item for each agent and allocate iteratively while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation.
   - Aim to match the proportional value each agent should receive.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 3, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 4, 6

**Explanation:**
- Agent 0 values items [2, 3, 5] as 90 + 34 + 30 = 154, which is a significant portion of their total value.
- Agent 1 values items [0, 1, 4, 6] as 88 + 40 + 42 + 99 = 269, which is a fair portion of their total value.
- This allocation respects the proportional shares and seeks to minimize envy by providing each agent with items they highly value.

Finally, here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 6]
}
```
