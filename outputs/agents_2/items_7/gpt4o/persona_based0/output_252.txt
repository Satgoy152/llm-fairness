Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  68  49  42  59  35  68
1  82  32  40  25  87  40  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuation: [1, 68, 49, 42, 59, 35, 68]
- Agent 1's valuation: [82, 32, 40, 25, 87, 40, 12]

A possible fair distribution can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Identify which items are most valuable to each agent.
2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing their total valuation while minimizing envy.

Considering the valuations, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 1 (value 68)
   - Item 6 (value 68)
   - Item 3 (value 42)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0 (value 82)
   - Item 4 (value 87)
   - Item 2 (value 40)
   - Item 5 (value 40)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that they highly value, and the distribution attempts to balance the total perceived value of the allocations.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the two agents.
