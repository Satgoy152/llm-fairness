Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  98  23  52  58  33  84
1  88  87  98  99  76  80  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while taking into account their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free division. This means each agent should prefer their allocation or be indifferent to it compared to others' allocations. We can use a simple approach to distribute the items by maximizing each agent's satisfaction. Though a perfect envy-free allocation is challenging with integer items, we can aim for a balanced approach.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: [26, 98, 23, 52, 58, 33, 84]
- Agent 1 values items: [88, 87, 98, 99, 76, 80, 81]

We will allocate the items to maximize the total value each agent receives.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Determine Preferences**: Each agent values items differently, so let's list the items each agent values the most.

   - For Agent 0, the highest valued items are: Item 1 (98), Item 6 (84), Item 4 (58).
   - For Agent 1, the highest valued items are: Item 3 (99), Item 2 (98), Item 0 (88).

2. **Fair Allocation**: We aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while trying to balance the allocation.

   - Agent 0 receives: Item 1, Item 6, and Item 4.
   - Agent 1 receives: Item 3, Item 2, Item 0, and Item 5.

3. **Check Total Items**: Ensure all items are allocated: 7 items in total.

### Resulting Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 4],
    "1": [3, 2, 0, 5]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all items are allocated fairly. Agent 0 receives three items with high personal value, while Agent 1 receives four items, also ensuring a high total valuation.
