Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  49  60  72  29  75  68
1  51  10  12  41  74  29  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [51 10 12 41 74 29 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for a distribution that minimizes envy. Envy can be minimized by ensuring that each agent receives items that they value highly, and ideally, the total value of items allocated to each agent should be as balanced as possible.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [12, 49, 60, 72, 29, 75, 68]
- Agent 1: [51, 10, 12, 41, 74, 29, 61]

First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0 = 12 + 49 + 60 + 72 + 29 + 75 + 68 = 365
- Total value for Agent 1 = 51 + 10 + 12 + 41 + 74 + 29 + 61 = 278

Now, let's try to allocate items such that the difference in the total value of items each agent receives is minimized.

### Allocation Strategy
1. Identify items with significant preference differences between the two agents.
2. Allocate items with the highest valuation per agent, while balancing the total valuation for each agent.

#### Proposed Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 2, 3
  - Valuation: 49 (item 1) + 60 (item 2) + 72 (item 3) = 181
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 4, 5, 6
  - Valuation: 51 (item 0) + 74 (item 4) + 29 (item 5) + 61 (item 6) = 215

This allocation gives a balanced distribution of total valuations, which helps in achieving a fair and envy-free allocation.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
