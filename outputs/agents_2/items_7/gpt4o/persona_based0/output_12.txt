Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  92  77  54  76  65  35
1  11  77  49  75  54  62   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[74 92 77 54 76 65 35]
 [11 77 49 75 54 62  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while focusing on envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, trying to ensure that neither agent envies the allocation of the other. 

Given the valuations:

Agent 0: [74, 92, 77, 54, 76, 65, 35]  
Agent 1: [11, 77, 49, 75, 54, 62, 9]

Let's analyze and allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 1 (value 92 for Agent 0, 77 for Agent 1)**: 
   - Agent 0 values this item the most (92), so assign item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 0 (value 74 for Agent 0, 11 for Agent 1)**: 
   - Agent 0 values this item significantly more, assign item 0 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2 (value 77 for Agent 0, 49 for Agent 1)**: 
   - Agent 0 values this item more than Agent 1, assign item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3 (value 54 for Agent 0, 75 for Agent 1)**:
   - Agent 1 values this item more, assign item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4 (value 76 for Agent 0, 54 for Agent 1)**:
   - Agent 0 values this item more, assign item 4 to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5 (value 65 for Agent 0, 62 for Agent 1)**: 
   - This is closely valued by both, but Agent 0 has a higher valuation, assign item 5 to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6 (value 35 for Agent 0, 9 for Agent 1)**: 
   - Agent 0 values this item more, but since Agent 0 has already received a significant number, let's balance by assigning this item to Agent 1.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [3, 6]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5.  
Agent 1 receives items 3 and 6. 

This allocation attempts to ensure that both agents receive a fair share according to their valuations, with Agent 0 receiving slightly more due to their higher valuations across most items.
