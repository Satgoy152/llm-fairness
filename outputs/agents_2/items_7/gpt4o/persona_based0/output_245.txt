Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  16  33  50  74  39  17
1  72  73  90  82  37  98  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [72 73 90 82 37 98 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for a solution that is envy-free or as close to it as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 22 + 16 + 33 + 50 + 74 + 39 + 17 = 251
- Agent 1's total valuation: 72 + 73 + 90 + 82 + 37 + 98 + 60 = 512

Given that the total valuation of Agent 1 is higher, they should typically receive a larger portion of the total value to achieve a fair distribution.

Let's evaluate a potential allocation:

1. Assign items primarily to the agent who values them more, while ensuring that the total allocation is balanced in terms of the number of items each agent receives.

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 1 receives items: [1, 2, 5, 6]

Now let's check the total valuation for each agent based on this allocation:

- Agent 0's valuation for items [0, 3, 4]: 22 + 50 + 74 = 146
- Agent 1's valuation for items [1, 2, 5, 6]: 73 + 90 + 98 + 60 = 321

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution by giving Agent 0 a smaller number of high-value items and Agent 1 a larger number of items they value highly. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed between the two agents.
