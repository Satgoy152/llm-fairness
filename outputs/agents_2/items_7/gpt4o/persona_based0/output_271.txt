Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  48  86   4  26  68  92
1  84  42  31  88  15  53  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated.

First, let's summarize the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 38 + 48 + 86 + 4 + 26 + 68 + 92 = 362
- Agent 1's total valuation: 84 + 42 + 31 + 88 + 15 + 53 + 21 = 334

Next, let's try to allocate the items such that both agents receive approximately equal total valuations based on their preferences.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Give Agent 0 the items they value highly: 2, 5, 6
   - Valuation for Agent 0: 86 + 68 + 92 = 246
   - Valuation for Agent 1: 31 + 53 + 21 = 105

2. Give Agent 1 the remaining items: 0, 1, 3, 4
   - Valuation for Agent 0: 38 + 48 + 4 + 26 = 116
   - Valuation for Agent 1: 84 + 42 + 88 + 15 = 229

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 246
- Agent 1's total valuation: 229

The allocation above attempts to be as fair as possible by considering the total valuations each agent places on their assigned items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```
