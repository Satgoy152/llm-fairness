Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  25  23  59  13  35  99
1  35  57  31  45  70  52  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between two agents with the goal of achieving some level of envy-freeness, we can consider balancing the total value each agent receives. The values each agent assigns to the items are as follows:

- Agent 0's valuations: [6, 25, 23, 59, 13, 35, 99]
- Agent 1's valuations: [35, 57, 31, 45, 70, 52, 42]

Here's the strategy:

1. Calculate total value for each agent if they received all items:
   - Agent 0: 6 + 25 + 23 + 59 + 13 + 35 + 99 = 260
   - Agent 1: 35 + 57 + 31 + 45 + 70 + 52 + 42 = 332

2. Aim to divide items such that the total value perceived by each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's assign items to balance the perceived total value:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1, 2, 5] with a total value of 6 + 25 + 23 + 35 = 89.
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 4, 6] with a total value of 45 + 70 + 42 = 157.

Now, let's verify the perceived values for each agent:

- Agent 0's perceived total value: 6 + 25 + 23 + 35 = 89
- Agent 1's perceived total value: 59 + 13 + 99 = 171

These allocations seem inequitable, and we should adjust to better balance the perceived values:

Reassign items to balance perceived total values more fairly:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 2, 4, 6] with a total value of 6 + 23 + 13 + 99 = 141.
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 3, 5] with a total value of 57 + 45 + 52 = 154.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the perceived total value for each agent more equitably.
