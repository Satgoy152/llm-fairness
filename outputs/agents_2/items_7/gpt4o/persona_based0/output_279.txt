Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  95  81  74  79  67  58
1  11  65  72  86  20  69   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items between the 2 agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they received a fair share based on their own valuations. Here, we will use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring no envy.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [52, 95, 81, 74, 79, 67, 58]
- Agent 1's valuations: [11, 65, 72, 86, 20, 69, 7]

One approach is to allocate items in a way that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives according to their own valuation. Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 1, 2, 4.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 3, 5, 2.

2. **Allocate items to agents:**
   - Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most if it doesn't cause overlap:
     - Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 95).
     - Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 86).

3. **Continue allocation based on remaining high values:**
   - Agent 0's next highest valued item is 2 (value 81).
   - Agent 1's next highest valued item is 5 (value 69).

4. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - We must ensure each agent gets a fair share of the remaining items based on their valuations:
     - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 79).
     - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 11).

5. **Allocate last remaining item:**
   - Item 6 remains unassigned. Compare valuations for it:
     - Agent 0's valuation is 58.
     - Agent 1's valuation is 7.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as they value it more.

Now, we review the allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 3, 5, 0

This allocation ensures both agents receive a fair share based on their own valuations and minimizes envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [3, 5, 0]
}
```
