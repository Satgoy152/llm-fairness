Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  39  50  25  84  46  72
1  62   0  64  69  35  30  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [62  0 64 69 35 30 11]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we first consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation, ideally making sure no agent envies the other's allocation.

**Valuations Table:**

- Agent 0: [35, 39, 50, 25, 84, 46, 72]
- Agent 1: [62, 0, 64, 69, 35, 30, 11]

**Approach:**

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 35 + 39 + 50 + 25 + 84 + 46 + 72 = 351
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 62 + 0 + 64 + 69 + 35 + 30 + 11 = 271

2. **Find the Maximum Valuation Per Item:**
   - For each item, determine which agent values it more. 

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (62 > 35)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (39 > 0)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (64 > 50)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (69 > 25)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (84 > 35)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (46 > 30)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (72 > 11)

4. **Adjust for Fairness and Integer Allocation:**
   - Ensure that both agents receive a fair allocation according to their preferences and total valuations.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - After reviewing the allocations and ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we finalize the distribution ensuring no agent envies the other based on their total valuation.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items [1, 4, 5, 6] and Agent 1 receives items [0, 2, 3]. This allocation balances the total valuations as closely as possible, reducing potential envy and ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items.
