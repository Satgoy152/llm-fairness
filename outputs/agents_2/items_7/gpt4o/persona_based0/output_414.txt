Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  95  14  40  52  83  77
1  62  79  35  64  65  67  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items that minimizes envy between the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum valuation each agent receives, often referred to as the "maximin" approach. This approach aims to allocate items in such a way that the agent with the lowest total value gets the maximum possible value given the constraints.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

Agent 0:  
- Total valuation = 87 + 95 + 14 + 40 + 52 + 83 + 77 = 448

Agent 1:  
- Total valuation = 62 + 79 + 35 + 64 + 65 + 67 + 39 = 411

Next, we aim to allocate the items to balance the total valuation received by each agent as much as possible, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

To find an allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, and 5.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 1, 3, 4, and 5.

Let's try to allocate items considering these preferences:

1. Start by allocating items that have a clear preference by one agent over the other:

   - Item 0: Agent 0 (87 vs. 62)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (35 vs. 14)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (64 vs. 40)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (65 vs. 52)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (77 vs. 39)

2. Now we have items 1 and 5 left, both valued highly by both agents. We need to make a decision to balance the total values:

   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (95 vs. 79)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (67 vs. 83)

Now, let's check the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 6
  - Total valuation for Agent 0 = 87 + 95 + 77 = 259

- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 4, 5
  - Total valuation for Agent 1 = 35 + 64 + 65 + 67 = 231

This allocation gives a relatively balanced outcome given the constraints, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
