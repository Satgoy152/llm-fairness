Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51   1  75  58   4  34  27
1  68  28  30  37  37  91   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [68 28 30 37 37 91  5]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent gets an envy-free allocation of items, we need to allocate the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation. In this problem, we'll consider allocating items to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that the allocation is as fair as possible.

Let's consider the valuations for the two agents:

- Agent 0: [51, 1, 75, 58, 4, 34, 27]
- Agent 1: [68, 28, 30, 37, 37, 91, 5]

One approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, and then adjust if necessary to ensure a fair distribution of the number of items.

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (75), so let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (91), so let's allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. Next, allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it at 68, which is higher than Agent 0's value of 51.
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it at 28, which is higher than Agent 0's value of 1.
5. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it at 58, which is higher than Agent 1's value of 37.
6. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as they value it at 37, which is higher than Agent 0's value of 4.
7. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0, as they value it at 27, which is higher than Agent 1's value of 5.

With this allocation, each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 4, 5

Let me now present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 5]
}
```
