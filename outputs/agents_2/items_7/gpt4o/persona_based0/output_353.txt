Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  82  50  63   9  47  72
1  25  76  53  25  13   3  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and attempt to create an allocation that is envy-free, which means no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided, let's implement the following approach:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items iteratively to the agent that values them the most, ensuring a balance in the total value received by each agent.

Here are the steps for the allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent gives to all items:
   - Agent 0: \(49 + 82 + 50 + 63 + 9 + 47 + 72 = 372\)
   - Agent 1: \(25 + 76 + 53 + 25 + 13 + 3 + 80 = 275\)

2. Start assigning items to the agent who values them the most, keeping track of the total value of items each agent receives.

3. Check the valuations for each item and allocate:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 at 25. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 82, Agent 1 at 76. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 at 53. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 63, Agent 1 at 25. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 at 13. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 at 3. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 at 80. Assign to Agent 1.

4. Check the allocation:
   - Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 3, and 5 with a total value of \(49 + 82 + 63 + 47 = 241\).
   - Agent 1 receives items 2, 4, and 6 with a total value of \(53 + 13 + 80 = 146\).

This allocation attempts to ensure that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations, although not envy-free, it is a reasonable allocation based on the given valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
