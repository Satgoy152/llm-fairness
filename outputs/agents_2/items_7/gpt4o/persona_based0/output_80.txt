Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  90  62  24  37  42  86
1  16  40  64  51  49  40  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To approach this problem, we'll aim to fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that respects the principle of envy-freeness, ensuring that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 has higher valuations for items 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6 compared to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 and item 4 more than Agent 0.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - We will attempt to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible, given their respective valuations.

3. **Valuations Summary:**
   - Agent 0: [55, 90, 62, 24, 37, 42, 86]
   - Agent 1: [16, 40, 64, 51, 49, 40, 17]

4. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0: This gives Agent 0 a high-value item.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0: Another high-value item for Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1: Agent 1 values this item the most.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1: This is the second-highest valued item for Agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1: Another item Agent 1 values more than Agent 0.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0: Agent 0 values this item significantly more than Agent 1.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0: Agent 0 values this item higher than Agent 1.

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0's Total Valuation:** 90 (item 1) + 86 (item 6) + 55 (item 0) + 42 (item 5) = 273
- **Agent 1's Total Valuation:** 64 (item 2) + 51 (item 3) + 49 (item 4) = 164

The allocations ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items, and the division attempts to balance their respective valuations.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to respect each agent's preferences and ensures that all items are distributed fairly, given the constraints.
