Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  86  24  58  28  24  19
1  55  10  94  79  46  28  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to find an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation means that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(8 + 86 + 24 + 58 + 28 + 24 + 19 = 247\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(55 + 10 + 94 + 79 + 46 + 28 + 61 = 373\)

Next, let's consider the valuations for each item and try to allocate items to minimize envy. We want to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their total valuation.

1. Start by allocating the high-value items to the agents who value them the most:
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 86, which is the highest value for that item. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 94, which is the highest value for that item. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 79, which is the highest value for that item. Allocate to Agent 1.

2. Allocate remaining items to balance the total value:
   - Agent 0 should ideally get items totaling around half of their total valuation.
   - Agent 1 should ideally get items totaling around half of their total valuation.

3. Continue allocating the remaining items:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 55, which is more than Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 28, and Agent 1 at 46. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Allocate to Agent 0 to balance the allocations.
   - Item 6: Allocate to Agent 0 for balancing the allocations.

After allocation, ensure that all 7 items are distributed, and each agent has a fair share:

- Agent 0 receives items: [1, 5, 6]
- Agent 1 receives items: [0, 2, 3, 4]

In JSON format, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy and provide a fair distribution based on their valuations.
