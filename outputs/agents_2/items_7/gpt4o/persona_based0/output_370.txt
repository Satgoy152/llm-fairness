Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  84  56  75  78   3  81
1  42  63  82  52  10  46  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use the method of maximizing the minimum utility or leveraging the concept of "envy-free" allocations as much as possible. Given the valuations for the items, we aim to distribute the items so each agent perceives their allocation as fair or at least acceptable based on their preferences.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Value:** First, calculate the total value each agent places on all the items.
   - Agent 0: 96 + 84 + 56 + 75 + 78 + 3 + 81 = 473
   - Agent 1: 42 + 63 + 82 + 52 + 10 + 46 + 78 = 373

2. **Proportional Fair Share:** Each agent's fair share of the total value is determined by the total value divided by the number of agents.
   - Agent 0's fair share: 473 / 2 = 236.5
   - Agent 1's fair share: 373 / 2 = 186.5

3. **Allocate Items:** To ensure fairness, allocate items that maximize the perceived value for each agent while ensuring that neither agent envies the other (as much as possible).

   - Assign the highest-valued items to each agent until their fair share is met or exceeded.

**Proposed Allocation:**

- Assign items 0, 1, and 4 to Agent 0, as these give them the highest total value without exceeding Agent 1's share.
  - Agent 0: 96 + 84 + 78 = 258
- Assign items 2, 3, 5, and 6 to Agent 1.
  - Agent 1: 82 + 52 + 46 + 78 = 258

This allocation gives both agents a total value of 258, which is as fair as possible given the constraints.

**Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
