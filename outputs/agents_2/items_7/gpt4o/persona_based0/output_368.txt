Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32   9  71  94  28  78  35
1  11  23  14  76  62  50  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that neither agent envies the otherâ€™s allocation if possible. This means trying to achieve an allocation where each agent values their own set of items at least as much as the other agent's set. While achieving perfect envy-freeness might not always be possible, we can still aim for an allocation that minimizes envy.

Let's begin by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(32 + 9 + 71 + 94 + 28 + 78 + 35 = 347\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(11 + 23 + 14 + 76 + 62 + 50 + 49 = 285\)

Next, let's attempt to allocate the items by maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive while minimizing potential envy. One approach is to use a greedy allocation method, where we assign items based on the highest difference in valuations between the two agents.

Let's start allocating:

1. Item 3: Agent 0 values at 94, Agent 1 at 76. Difference = 18 (Assign to Agent 0)
2. Item 2: Agent 0 values at 71, Agent 1 at 14. Difference = 57 (Assign to Agent 0)
3. Item 5: Agent 0 values at 78, Agent 1 at 50. Difference = 28 (Assign to Agent 0)
4. Item 6: Agent 0 values at 35, Agent 1 at 49. Difference = -14 (Assign to Agent 1)
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values at 28, Agent 1 at 62. Difference = -34 (Assign to Agent 1)
6. Item 0: Agent 0 values at 32, Agent 1 at 11. Difference = 21 (Assign to Agent 0)
7. Item 1: Agent 0 values at 9, Agent 1 at 23. Difference = -14 (Assign to Agent 1)

After this allocation, the items are distributed as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 2, 5, 0]
- Agent 1: Items [6, 4, 1]

Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0's total valuation for their items: \(94 + 71 + 78 + 32 = 275\)
- Agent 1's total valuation for their items: \(49 + 62 + 23 = 134\)

Given these valuations, each agent receives items based on their preferences as much as possible, while ensuring a complete allocation of all items.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 5, 0],
    "1": [6, 4, 1]
}
```
