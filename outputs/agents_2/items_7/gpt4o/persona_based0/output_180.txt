Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  54  22  42  44  11  70
1  47  22  81  30   1  94  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. A common method to achieve this is by using the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 24 + 54 + 22 + 42 + 44 + 11 + 70 = 267
- Agent 1's total valuation: 47 + 22 + 81 + 30 + 1 + 94 + 44 = 319

Now, we can attempt to allocate the items such that the total value each agent receives is approximately proportional to their total valuation.

Let's consider some potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has a higher valuation for items 0 and 6.
2. **Agent 1** has a higher valuation for items 2, 5, and 3.

Given these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows to ensure fairness:

- Assign items 0, 1, 3, and 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 2, 4, and 5 to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the total value each agent receives with this allocation:

- **Agent 0's allocation**: Items 0, 1, 3, 6.
  - Total value for Agent 0: 24 (item 0) + 54 (item 1) + 42 (item 3) + 70 (item 6) = 190

- **Agent 1's allocation**: Items 2, 4, 5.
  - Total value for Agent 1: 81 (item 2) + 1 (item 4) + 94 (item 5) = 176

While these values are not perfectly equal, they reflect a fair division given the different preferences and total valuations. Now, I'll present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 5]
}
```
