Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  15  82  19  16  66  20
1  27   3  25  93  50   0  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of the other agent based on their own valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [30, 15, 82, 19, 16, 66, 20]
- Agent 1: [27, 3, 25, 93, 50, 0, 34]

We can calculate the total value each agent assigns to the items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 248
- Total value for Agent 1: 232

Next, let's try to allocate items to ensure that each agent's share is roughly proportional to their total valuation and consider their highest value items to minimize envy.

Allocation strategy:

1. **Assign high-value items to the agent that values them most:**
    - Item 2 (Value 82 for Agent 0, 25 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 0
    - Item 3 (Value 19 for Agent 0, 93 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1

2. **Distribute remaining items to balance total value:**
    - Item 0 (Value 30 for Agent 0, 27 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 0
    - Item 4 (Value 16 for Agent 0, 50 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1
    - Item 5 (Value 66 for Agent 0, 0 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 0
    - Item 6 (Value 20 for Agent 0, 34 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1
    - Item 1 (Value 15 for Agent 0, 3 for Agent 1): Assign to Agent 0

Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 2, 5, 1] with total valuation: 30 + 82 + 66 + 15 = 193
- Agent 1 receives items: [3, 4, 6] with total valuation: 93 + 50 + 34 = 177

While the total valuations are not exactly equal, the allocation gives each agent their most valued items and balances the remaining items to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
