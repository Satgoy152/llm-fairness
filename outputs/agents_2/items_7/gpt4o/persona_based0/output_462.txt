Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  20  47  53  79  74   2
1  47  22  67  26  40  13  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the discrete nature of the items. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that they received at least as much value as they would have gotten from any other allocation, considering their valuations.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items combined:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 16 + 20 + 47 + 53 + 79 + 74 + 2 = 291
- Agent 1's total valuation: 47 + 22 + 67 + 26 + 40 + 13 + 66 = 281

The goal is to allocate the items so that each agent feels satisfied with their share based on their valuations.

To achieve an approximately fair division, we can use a simple heuristic to maximize each agent's satisfaction by greedily assigning items to the agent that values them more until all items are allocated.

Let's go through each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (47 vs. 16).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (20 vs. 22).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (67 vs. 47).
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (53 vs. 26).
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (79 vs. 40).
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (74 vs. 13).
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it more (66 vs. 2).

However, to balance the allocation, we need to consider the total valuation each agent receives.

Using this heuristic strategy, the allocations can be made as follows:

- Agent 0: [1, 3, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 6]

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent receives with this allocation:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 20 (item 1) + 53 (item 3) + 79 (item 4) + 74 (item 5) = 226
- Agent 1's total valuation: 47 (item 0) + 67 (item 2) + 66 (item 6) = 180

The allocations are made such that each agent feels they have a fair share given their preferences, considering the constraints of indivisible items, and the distribution is balanced in terms of the total value perceived by each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 6]
}
```
