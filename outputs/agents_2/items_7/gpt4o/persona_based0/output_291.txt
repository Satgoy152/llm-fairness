Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  40  47  15  52  75   9
1  65  80  97  90  76  79  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a set of items such that the distribution is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness in this context means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent to their own allocation based on their valuations.

Let's look at the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total value for all items: 87 + 40 + 47 + 15 + 52 + 75 + 9 = 325
- Agent 1's total value for all items: 65 + 80 + 97 + 90 + 76 + 79 + 62 = 549

To find a fair allocation, we need to balance these valuations by distributing items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is approximately equal, or as equitable as possible given the constraints.

One approach is to start by allocating items based on the highest individual valuations for each agent, and then adjust to balance the total perceived value.

### Allocation Process

1. **Highly Valued Items:**
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (97) and item 3 (90).
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (87) and item 5 (75).

2. **Initial Assignment:**
   - Assign item 2 and item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 0 and item 5 to Agent 0.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items remaining to allocate: 1, 4, 6.

4. **Balancing the Remaining Items:**
   - Check the remaining valuation for each agent:
     - Agent 0: Items 1 (40), 4 (52), 6 (9)
     - Agent 1: Items 1 (80), 4 (76), 6 (62)

5. **Allocate Remaining Items:**  
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 due to higher valuation (80 vs 40).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 due to balancing the total value (52 vs 76).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 to balance the remaining total value (62 vs 9).

### Final Allocation

Now, we can present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items such that their total perceived values are reasonably balanced, given the constraints of the problem.
