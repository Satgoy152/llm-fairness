Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  44  53  23  32  75  25
1  35  67  55  14  57  38  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, i.e., neither agent should prefer the other's allocation over their own given their respective valuations.

First, let's sum the total valuation for each agent to understand their preferences:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 87 + 44 + 53 + 23 + 32 + 75 + 25 = 339
- Agent 1's total valuation: 35 + 67 + 55 + 14 + 57 + 38 + 23 = 289

Next, let's try to balance the valuations of the items allocated to each agent to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0's highest-valued items**:
   - Item 0: 87
   - Item 5: 75
   - Item 2: 53
   - Item 1: 44

2. **Agent 1's highest-valued items**:
   - Item 1: 67
   - Item 4: 57
   - Item 2: 55
   - Item 5: 38

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, as it is their most valued item.
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0, as it is their second-highest valued item and Agent 1 values it less.
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1, as it is their most valued item.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0, as it is more valued by Agent 0 than Agent 1.
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1, as it is their second-highest valued item.
- Allocate Item 3 and Item 6 to Agent 1, as these have relatively low values for both agents but help balance the distribution.

This allocation is based on maximizing each agent's total value from their respective allocations while keeping the distribution balanced. Let's present it in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
