Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83   1  27  87  39  46  26
1  29  45  84  19  81  20  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we start by calculating each agent's total valuation for all items and then strive to allocate the items such that the perceived value for each agent is approximately balanced. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's valuations: 83, 1, 27, 87, 39, 46, 26
   - Total for Agent 0 = 83 + 1 + 27 + 87 + 39 + 46 + 26 = 309
   
   - Agent 1's valuations: 29, 45, 84, 19, 81, 20, 19
   - Total for Agent 1 = 29 + 45 + 84 + 19 + 81 + 20 + 19 = 297

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start by assigning the highest valued items for each agent, considering their preferences and ensuring the total value each receives is balanced.
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most, followed by item 0. Agent 1 values item 2 the most, followed by item 4.

3. **Initial Allocations:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value = 87 for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value = 84 for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value = 83 for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value = 81 for Agent 1).

4. **Balance Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: 1, 5, 6
   - Valuations for remaining items:
     - Agent 0: 1, 46, 26
     - Agent 1: 45, 20, 19

   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value = 45 for Agent 1) to balance the distribution as Agent 0 already has high-value items.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value = 46 for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value = 26 for Agent 0).

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 5, 6
   - Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 4

The allocations ensure that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
