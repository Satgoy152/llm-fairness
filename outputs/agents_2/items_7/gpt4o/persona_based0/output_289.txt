Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  39  81  29  66  72  70
1  34  28  81  55  32  88  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items so that no agent would prefer the other agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's begin by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 22 + 39 + 81 + 29 + 66 + 72 + 70 = 379
- Agent 1's total valuation: 34 + 28 + 81 + 55 + 32 + 88 + 15 = 333

Next, we will attempt to create allocations that maximize each agent's satisfaction and minimize envy.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Prioritize items with the highest value for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Prioritize items with the highest value for Agent 1.

Let's allocate the items based on the above strategy:

- **Agent 0's highest valued items:**
  - Item 2: 81
  - Item 5: 72
  - Item 6: 70
  - Item 4: 66

- **Agent 1's highest valued items:**
  - Item 5: 88
  - Item 2: 81
  - Item 3: 55
  - Item 0: 34

In order to find a fair allocation, let's proceed with assigning items to each agent to balance their total valuations as closely as possible.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [2, 5, 6]
  - Valuation: 81 + 72 + 70 = 223

- **Agent 1:** Items [0, 1, 3, 4]
  - Valuation: 34 + 28 + 55 + 32 = 149

### Final Allocation:

After reviewing the allocations and ensuring both agents have integer numbers of items (and all 7 items are allocated), we finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives a fair share based on their preference.
