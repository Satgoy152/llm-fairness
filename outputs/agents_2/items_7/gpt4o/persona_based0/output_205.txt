Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  31   0   8  51  28  29
1  80  32  24  60  38  35  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as what the other agent receives. We'll strive to balance the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values: `[40, 31, 0, 8, 51, 28, 29]` 
   - Agent 1 values: `[80, 32, 24, 60, 38, 35, 36]`

2. **Identify Valuation Sums:**
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: `40 + 31 + 0 + 8 + 51 + 28 + 29 = 187`
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: `80 + 32 + 24 + 60 + 38 + 35 + 36 = 305`

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - We want to ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation. One way to achieve this is by dividing items such that the perceived value for each agent is maximized for their allocation. 

4. **Allocate Items:**
   - Prioritize items based on their difference in valuations for the agents and allocate accordingly.

5. **Perform Allocation:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (valuations: 80, 40)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (valuations: 31, 32)
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (valuations: 24, 0)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (valuations: 60, 8)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (valuations: 51, 38)
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (valuations: 28, 35)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (valuations: 29, 36)

### Final Allocation:

After reviewing the perceived values for each allocation, the following distribution ensures a balanced value perception for both agents:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value for both agents, aiming to minimize envy and ensure a fair division according to the valuations provided.
