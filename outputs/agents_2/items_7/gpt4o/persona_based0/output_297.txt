Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6
0  96  97  38  73  50  31  2
1  19  69  19  74  23  30  0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will aim to maximize the satisfaction of both agents based on their valuations. The goal is to distribute items such that each agent feels they received a fair share of the total value. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Sum of Valuations**: Calculate the total valuation for each agent.

   - Agent 0: 96 + 97 + 38 + 73 + 50 + 31 + 2 = 387
   - Agent 1: 19 + 69 + 19 + 74 + 23 + 30 + 0 = 234

2. **Initial Allocation Consideration**: Start by considering high-value items for each agent.

3. **Envy-Freeness**: Try to distribute items such that neither agent envies the allocation of the other.

Given these constraints, we'll analyze and allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Prefers items with high valuations, such as items 0 (96), 1 (97), and 3 (73).
- **Agent 1**: Prefers item 3 (74) and item 1 (69).

Since item 3 (74) is highly valued by both agents, we should allocate it to the agent who would benefit more relative to their total valuation.

Let's allocate as follows to ensure fair division:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 5, and 6.
  - Valuations: 96 (0) + 97 (1) + 31 (5) + 2 (6) = 226

- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 3, and 4.
  - Valuations: 19 (2) + 74 (3) + 23 (4) = 116

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives a total valuation of 226.
- Agent 1 receives a total valuation of 116.

This distribution is fair in a sense that both agents receive a proportionate share relative to their total valuations.

Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
