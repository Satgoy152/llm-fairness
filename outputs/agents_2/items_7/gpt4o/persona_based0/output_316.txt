Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  25  95  82  34  67  50
1  84  36  62  89  39   4   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[37 25 95 82 34 67 50]
 [84 36 62 89 39  4  7]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims to minimize envy, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation of their allocated items while ensuring that the total number of items allocated sums to 7. 

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for each possible allocation of items:

### Agent 0's Valuations:
- Item 0: 37
- Item 1: 25
- Item 2: 95
- Item 3: 82
- Item 4: 34
- Item 5: 67
- Item 6: 50

### Agent 1's Valuations:
- Item 0: 84
- Item 1: 36
- Item 2: 62
- Item 3: 89
- Item 4: 39
- Item 5: 4
- Item 6: 7

### Allocation Strategy:
To minimize envy and aim for a fair division, we consider the highest valued items for each agent and attempt to split them such that the sum of the valuations is maximized for each agent.

1. **Assign the highest valued items first:**
   - Agent 0 highly values Item 2 (95) and Item 3 (82).
   - Agent 1 highly values Item 0 (84), Item 3 (89), and Item 2 (62).

2. **Resolve conflicts:**
   - Since both agents value Item 2 highly, we can allocate it to Agent 0 and give Agent 1 the next highest valued items.
   - We can give Item 3 to Agent 1 since they value it slightly higher than Agent 0.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Assign remaining items to balance the total valuations.

### Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 5, and 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 3, and 4

This allocation maximizes each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. The items are divided such that all 7 items are allocated.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```
