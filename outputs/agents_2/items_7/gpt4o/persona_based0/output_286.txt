Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  91  79  76  30  21  52
1  77  36  27  22  33  53  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here's a step-by-step strategy to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: \(75 + 91 + 79 + 76 + 30 + 21 + 52 = 424\)
   - Agent 1's total valuation: \(77 + 36 + 27 + 22 + 33 + 53 + 81 = 329\)

2. **Evaluate the Value of Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values at 75, Agent 1 values at 77
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values at 91, Agent 1 values at 36
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values at 79, Agent 1 values at 27
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values at 76, Agent 1 values at 22
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values at 30, Agent 1 values at 33
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values at 21, Agent 1 values at 53
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values at 52, Agent 1 values at 81

3. **Allocate Items Based on Valuation:**
   - Prioritize items to agents based on higher relative valuation to balance total values received.

4. **Allocate Items:**
   - Give Agent 0 items with relatively higher valuations by them compared to Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3, 0.
   - Give Agent 1 items with relatively higher valuations by them compared to Agent 0: Items 6, 5, 4.

5. **Re-evaluate to Ensure Fairness:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, 3: Total Value = \(75 + 91 + 79 + 76 = 321\)
   - Agent 1 receives items 4, 5, 6: Total Value = \(33 + 53 + 81 = 167\)
   - This allocation balances the total value received by each agent relative to their own valuation scales.

6. **Adjust if Needed:** 
   - The current allocation provides a reasonable balance in terms of each agent's perceived value.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation minimizes potential envy by attempting to give each agent items they value relatively higher, while ensuring that all items are distributed.
