Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  67  50  74   8  21  32
1  22  31  20   4  87  96  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering the valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as they perceive the other agent to have received. This can be a challenging task, but we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total perceived value while ensuring that the allocations are as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 1 + 67 + 50 + 74 + 8 + 21 + 32 = 253
- Agent 1's total valuation: 22 + 31 + 20 + 4 + 87 + 96 + 24 = 284

Now, we will try to allocate the items such that each agent's perceived value is maximized and relatively balanced.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High-value items for Agent 0: Items 3 (74), 1 (67), 2 (50)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High-value items for Agent 1: Items 5 (96), 4 (87), 0 (22), 6 (24)

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 1, 2, 3
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 67 + 50 + 74 = 191

- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 4, 5, 6
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 22 + 87 + 96 + 24 = 229

Both agents have received a set of items that maximizes their perceived value, and we have ensured that all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
