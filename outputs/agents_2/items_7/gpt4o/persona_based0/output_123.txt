Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  55   5  48  29  96  62
1  56  25  64  82  43   6  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 55  5 48 29 96 62]
 [56 25 64 82 43  6 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. An allocation is envy-free if each agent feels that their allocated bundle is at least as valuable as the bundle allocated to the other agent, based on their own valuation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [93, 55, 5, 48, 29, 96, 62]
Agent 1: [56, 25, 64, 82, 43, 6, 76]
```

Let's find an allocation that satisfies these conditions:

1. **Total value for Agent 0**: 93 + 55 + 5 + 48 + 29 + 96 + 62 = 388
2. **Total value for Agent 1**: 56 + 25 + 64 + 82 + 43 + 6 + 76 = 352

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is maximized and they have no incentive to envy the other.

We'll use a simple algorithm:
- Start by assigning the item with the highest valuation to the agent who values it most.
- Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

**Step-by-step allocation:**
1. **Item 0 (Agent 0 values it more)**: Allocate to Agent 0
2. **Item 1 (Agent 0 values it more)**: Allocate to Agent 0
3. **Item 2 (Agent 1 values it more)**: Allocate to Agent 1
4. **Item 3 (Agent 1 values it more)**: Allocate to Agent 1
5. **Item 4 (Agent 1 values it more)**: Allocate to Agent 1
6. **Item 5 (Agent 0 values it more)**: Allocate to Agent 0
7. **Item 6 (Agent 1 values it more)**: Allocate to Agent 1

**Final allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 4, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items such that their total valuation is maximized in comparison to the other agent's allocation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
