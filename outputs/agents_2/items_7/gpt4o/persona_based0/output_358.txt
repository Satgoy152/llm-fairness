Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  41  15   8  76  99  15
1  53  29  22  22  77  45  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0's total valuation**: 28 + 41 + 15 + 8 + 76 + 99 + 15 = 282
- **Agent 1's total valuation**: 53 + 29 + 22 + 22 + 77 + 45 + 73 = 321

Next, we want to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. We will try to balance the distribution by assigning items to agents in a way that maximizes their satisfaction.

Let's consider a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 5 (value 99)
   - Item 4 (value 76)
   - Item 0 (value 28)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 6 (value 73)
   - Item 1 (value 29)
   - Item 2 (value 22)
   - Item 3 (value 22)

This allocation ensures that each agent is getting items with substantial value according to their own valuations.

Let's check the total value each agent gets in this allocation:

- **Agent 0's allocation value**: 99 + 76 + 28 = 203
- **Agent 1's allocation value**: 73 + 29 + 22 + 22 = 146

This allocation provides Agent 0 with a higher value, but it's balanced given their higher valuations for their assigned items. Now, we present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 0],
    "1": [6, 1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents.
