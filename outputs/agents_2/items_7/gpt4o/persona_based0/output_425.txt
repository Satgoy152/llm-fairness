Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  12  63  25  18  12  61
1  22  75  54  91   3  34  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering the valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim for an allocation that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their own valuations.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **List individual item preferences for each agent:**

   - Agent 0's valuations: [16, 12, 63, 25, 18, 12, 61]
   - Agent 1's valuations: [22, 75, 54, 91, 3, 34, 89]

2. **Determine the total value each agent perceives for all items:**

   - Total value for Agent 0: \(16 + 12 + 63 + 25 + 18 + 12 + 61 = 207\)
   - Total value for Agent 1: \(22 + 75 + 54 + 91 + 3 + 34 + 89 = 368\)

3. **Allocate items to maximize perceived value and maintain envy-freeness:**

   - **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for items 1, 3, and 6. Allocating these to Agent 1 would maximize their utility:
     - Item 1: 75
     - Item 3: 91
     - Item 6: 89
     - Total value for Agent 1: \(75 + 91 + 89 = 255\)

   - **Agent 0** receives the remaining items:
     - Item 0: 16
     - Item 2: 63
     - Item 4: 18
     - Item 5: 12
     - Total value for Agent 0: \(16 + 63 + 18 + 12 = 109\)

4. **Check the allocation for envy-freeness:**

   - Agent 0's total valuation for their items is 109. If they had Agent 1's items, their perceived value would be \(12 + 25 + 61 = 98\).
   - Agent 1's total valuation for their items is 255. If they had Agent 0's items, their perceived value would be \(22 + 54 + 3 + 34 = 113\).
   
   Both agents value their allocations higher than the other's, maintaining envy-freeness.

5. **Final allocation in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items with a total of 7 items allocated, and it is envy-free given the valuations.
