Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  45  84   7  77   3  36
1  76  26  89  19  20  29  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures both agents receive items according to their valuations. Our objective is to maximize each agent's total value from their allocated items, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated equals 7.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:  
  - Item 0: 92
  - Item 1: 45
  - Item 2: 84
  - Item 3: 7
  - Item 4: 77
  - Item 5: 3
  - Item 6: 36

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 76
  - Item 1: 26
  - Item 2: 89
  - Item 3: 19
  - Item 4: 20
  - Item 5: 29
  - Item 6: 23

A reasonable approach is to allocate items based on which agent values them most, while ensuring both agents receive a fair share of the total value. Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 92, while Agent 1 values it at 76. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 45, while Agent 1 values it at 26. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 84, while Agent 1 values it at 89. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 7, while Agent 1 values it at 19. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 77, while Agent 1 values it at 20. Allocate to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 3, while Agent 1 values it at 29. Allocate to Agent 1.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 36, while Agent 1 values it at 23. Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation maximizes each agent's total value from their allocated items:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 4, and 6 with a total valuation of 250.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 3, and 5 with a total valuation of 137.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
