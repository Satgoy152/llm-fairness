Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  49  76  19  84  60  91
1   4  53  19  88  13  83  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the valuations for each item by the two agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 at 4.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 at 53.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 19.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 at 88.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 at 13.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 at 83.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 at 82.

To achieve an allocation that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while considering envy-freeness, we could use the following strategy:

1. Allocate items to the agent who values them the most, considering the balance in fairness.
2. Ensure that each agent ends up with roughly similar total valuations to avoid envy.

Let's attempt this allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items where their valuation is significantly higher: Items 2, 4, and 6.
- Agent 1 gets items where their valuation is significantly higher: Items 1, 3, and 5.
- Item 0 goes to Agent 0 due to slightly higher valuation than Agent 1.

Let's check the total valuations:

- Agent 0: 21 (Item 0) + 76 (Item 2) + 84 (Item 4) + 91 (Item 6) = 272
- Agent 1: 53 (Item 1) + 88 (Item 3) + 83 (Item 5) = 224

While the allocation is not perfectly envy-free in terms of exact total valuations, it ensures that each agent gets the items they value relatively higher.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
