Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  33  98  93  38  87  93
1  54  56  44  63  21   3   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, meaning each agent should feel they received as much value as possible given the constraints.

First, we calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: \(28 + 33 + 98 + 93 + 38 + 87 + 93 = 470\)
- Agent 1: \(54 + 56 + 44 + 63 + 21 + 3 + 5 = 246\)

Next, we attempt to assign items such that the distribution of total value is as equal as possible. Ideally, each agent would receive half of the combined total value:

Combined total value = 470 + 246 = 716  
Ideal per-agent value = 716 / 2 = 358

However, since we have integer allocations and each item goes to only one agent, we'll adjust to the closest feasible allocations.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Assign high-value items to balance total perceived value:**
   - Agent 0 values items 2 and 3 highly. Assign both to Agent 0.
   - Allocate items 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6 to balance the rest.

2. **Assign remaining items to balance the total value between agents as closely as possible:**
   - Agent 1 can get items 0 and 1, which are relatively high-value for them.
   - Assign items 4, 5, and 6 to Agent 0 to approach the target value for each agent.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
  - Total value: \(98 + 93 + 38 + 87 + 93 = 409\)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 0, 1
  - Total value: \(54 + 56 = 110\)

This allocation gives Agent 0 more total value, but it's constrained by the preferences and available items. Now, let me present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
