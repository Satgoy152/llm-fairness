Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  35  61  90  60  42  12
1  65  14  67   9  18  73  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 14 67  9 18 73 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent perceives their allocation as fair.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0: 36 + 35 + 61 + 90 + 60 + 42 + 12 = 336
- Agent 1: 65 + 14 + 67 + 9 + 18 + 73 + 40 = 286

Now, we'll allocate items to minimize the difference between the total valuations of assigned items for each agent and the overall totals above. This helps us achieve a balance that approximates envy-freeness.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Assign high-value items based on preference**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highest (90), followed by item 4 (60).
   - Agent 1 values item 5 highest (73), followed by item 0 (65).

2. **Allocate based on remaining highest values**:
   - Agent 0 should get items 3 and 4.
   - Agent 1 should get items 5 and 0.

3. **Distribute remaining items to balance values**:
   - Remaining items: 1, 2, 6
   - Agent 0 values item 2 as 61, so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 6 as 40, so allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
   - The remaining item 1 can be given to Agent 0 who values it higher than Agent 1.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: items 3, 4, 2, 1
- Agent 1: items 5, 0, 6

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations perceived by each agent.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 2, 1],
    "1": [5, 0, 6]
}
```
