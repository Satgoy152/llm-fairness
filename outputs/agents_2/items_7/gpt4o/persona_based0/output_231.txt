Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  85  87  61  54  81  99
1  51  45  66  66  64  87   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [51, 85, 87, 61, 54, 81, 99]
- Agent 1: [51, 45, 66, 66, 64, 87, 8]

We can start by calculating the total value each agent attributes to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 51 + 85 + 87 + 61 + 54 + 81 + 99 = 518
- Total value for Agent 1: 51 + 45 + 66 + 66 + 64 + 87 + 8 = 387

Given these totals, Agent 0 values the items more overall, but we must make sure each agent is satisfied with their allocation without envying the other.

To achieve a fair allocation, we focus on maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their own preferences, ideally ensuring that each item is allocated to the agent valuing it more or balancing the allocations so that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

One approach is to sort the items by the difference in valuations between the agents and allocate them based on who values them more:

1. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 99, while Agent 1 values it at 8 (difference = 91) - Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 85, while Agent 1 values it at 45 (difference = 40) - Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 87, while Agent 1 values it at 66 (difference = 21) - Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 87, while Agent 0 values it at 81 (difference = 6) - Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 64, while Agent 0 values it at 54 (difference = 10) - Allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 3: Both agents value it at 66, but Agent 1 has fewer allocated items, so allocate to Agent 1.
7. Item 0: Both agents value it equally at 51, but since Agent 0 has fewer allocated items, allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations and preferences.
