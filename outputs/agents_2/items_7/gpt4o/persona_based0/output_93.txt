Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  65  25  40  99  89  75
1  32  37   6  87  18  73  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the total value each agent ascribes to the items and try to balance perceived fairness.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \(7 + 65 + 25 + 40 + 99 + 89 + 75 = 400\)
- Agent 1: \(32 + 37 + 6 + 87 + 18 + 73 + 26 = 279\)

Next, we aim to allocate items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their valuations. To do this, we'll look for a way to distribute items that balances the total value perceived by each agent.

Let's try a few combinations and see if we can achieve an equitable distribution:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 and item 3 to Agent 1 (both high-value perceptions for respective agents).
2. Assign lower-value items from Agent 0's perspective to Agent 1, and vice versa, to balance the distribution.

Now, let's go through a potential allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Items: 0, 1, 4, 6
  - Total value: \(7 + 65 + 99 + 75 = 246\)

- Agent 1:
  - Items: 2, 3, 5
  - Total value: \(6 + 87 + 73 = 166\)

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 has items with a total value of 246/400 (61.5% of their perceived total value).
- Agent 1 has items with a total value of 166/279 (59.5% of their perceived total value).

While it may not be perfectly envy-free, each agent receives a fair share relative to their valuations, keeping in mind the constraints of integer allocations.

Given these considerations, here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
