Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22   5  36  96  75  29  81
1  69  33  80  80  78  64  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[22  5 36 96 75 29 81]
 [69 33 80 80 78 64 79]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we aim for a division that is envy-free, meaning that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation according to their own valuation. 

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 22 + 5 + 36 + 96 + 75 + 29 + 81 = 344
- Agent 1's total valuation: 69 + 33 + 80 + 80 + 78 + 64 + 79 = 483

To make it fair, we allocate items to each agent in a way that maximizes their respective valuations while keeping the division envy-free.

### Calculating Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued item is item 3 (96), followed by item 6 (81).
   - Allocate item 3 and item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued item is item 0 (69), followed by item 2 (80) and item 4 (78).
   - Allocate items 0, 2, and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items 1 and 5 remain unallocated.
   - Agent 0 values item 5 at 29 and item 1 at 5.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 at 64 and item 1 at 33.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 and item 1 to Agent 0 to balance the allocations further.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 3, 6, and 1
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 2, 4, and 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items maximizing their valuation while maintaining fairness.

{
    "0": [3, 6, 1],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 5]
}
```
