Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  98  43  43  54  51   5
1  20  22   6  10  50  11  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and strive for an allocation that minimizes envy. In this case, one possible approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Good" (EF1) concept, where each agent values their own bundle at least as much as the other agent's bundle, up to the removal of one item.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [25, 98, 43, 43, 54, 51, 5]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [20, 22, 6, 10, 50, 11, 86]

Given these values, let's try to allocate the items to minimize envy and ensure each agent has an integer number of items:

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:** This is a high-value item for Agent 0 (98), and Agent 1 does not value it as highly (22). 

2. **Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1:** This is a high-value item for Agent 1 (86), and Agent 0 values it the least (5).

3. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values this item (50) more than Agent 0 (54), but it's one of the higher valued items for Agent 1 after item 6.

4. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values this item (25) more than Agent 1 (20).

5. **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values this item (51) more than Agent 1 (11).

6. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values this item (43), while Agent 1 values it at 6.

7. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values this item (10), while Agent 0 values it equally (43).

Now let's ensure we have a feasible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [1, 0, 5, 2]
- Agent 1 receives items: [6, 4, 3]

Let's validate the total number of items allocated is 7, and each agent receives an integer number of items. This allocation provides a reasonable balance, given the significant differences in valuations between the agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 5, 2],
    "1": [6, 4, 3]
}
```

This allocation strives to be envy-free up to one item and ensures each agent receives a set of items that they value highly relative to the other agent.
