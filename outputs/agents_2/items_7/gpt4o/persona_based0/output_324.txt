Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  39  58  30  10  73  68
1  25   9  75  34  18   4   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of the other over their own.

### Valuations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 1: 39
  - Item 2: 58
  - Item 3: 30
  - Item 4: 10
  - Item 5: 73
  - Item 6: 68

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 25
  - Item 1: 9
  - Item 2: 75
  - Item 3: 34
  - Item 4: 18
  - Item 5: 4
  - Item 6: 2

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Identify each agent's most valued items**:
   - Agent 0's highest valuations are for items 5 (73) and 6 (68).
   - Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 2 (75).

2. **Avoiding envy**:
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 since it is their highest valued item.
   - Allocate items 5 and 6 to Agent 0 since they are highly valued by them.

3. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Agent 0: After assigning items 5 and 6 (highest for Agent 0), consider allocating item 1, which has the next highest valuation (39).
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 3 (34) next, as it is the second-highest for Agent 1.
   - Continue allocating remaining items (0 and 4) to the agents considering their preferences and balance.

### Final Allocation:
- Assign items to balance the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring no envy.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they highly value, which reduces the potential for envy. Agent 0 receives items with valuations of 39, 73, and 68, which are among their highest, while Agent 1 receives their top valued item (75) and other items to balance the total value they receive.
