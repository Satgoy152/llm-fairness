Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  16  27   5  44  86  91
1  93  54  77  70  42  63  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 54 77 70 42 63 23]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we aim to distribute the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that each agent should not prefer the bundle of the other agent over their own based on their valuations.

First, let's compute the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 75 + 16 + 27 + 5 + 44 + 86 + 91 = 344
- Agent 1's total valuation: 93 + 54 + 77 + 70 + 42 + 63 + 23 = 422

Now, let's try to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy.

1. Sort the items in descending order based on the difference in valuations between the two agents.
2. Allocate items starting with the largest difference in favor of the agent with the higher valuation.

### Item Allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (93 vs. 75), allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 6: Agent 0 values it more (91 vs. 23), allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 5: Agent 0 values it more (86 vs. 63), allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (54 vs. 16), allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (44 vs. 42), allocate to Agent 0.
6. Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (77 vs. 27), allocate to Agent 1.
7. Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (70 vs. 5), allocate to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 5, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2, 3

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0's valuation: 91 + 86 + 44 = 221
- Agent 1's valuation: 93 + 54 + 77 + 70 = 294

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free, but it balances the total valuation relatively evenly between the agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```
