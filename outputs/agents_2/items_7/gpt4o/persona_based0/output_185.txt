Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99   6   5  12  83  32  56
1  76  82  11  64  45  71  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation. This means each agent should believe they are receiving a fair share based on their valuations. We will utilize a method that attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items, while also ensuring each agent receives at least some items, if possible.

Let's consider the following steps:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**:  
   - Agent 0's total valuation = 99 + 6 + 5 + 12 + 83 + 32 + 56 = 293
   - Agent 1's total valuation = 76 + 82 + 11 + 64 + 45 + 71 + 40 = 389

2. **Determine Fair Share of Total Valuation**:  
   - Agent 0's fair share = 293 / (293 + 389) = 0.429
   - Agent 1's fair share = 389 / (293 + 389) = 0.571

3. **Allocate Items Based on Valuation and Fair Share**:  
   We aim to allocate items so that each agent's received valuation is close to their fair share.

4. **Greedy Allocation Strategy**:  
   - Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, then proceed to the next most valued item until all items are allocated.

   Allocation steps:
   - **Agent 0**:
     - Item 0: Value = 99
     - Item 4: Value = 83
     - Item 6: Value = 56
   - **Agent 1**:
     - Item 1: Value = 82
     - Item 5: Value = 71
     - Item 3: Value = 64
     - Item 2: Value = 11

5. **Check Fairness**:
   - Agent 0's total valuation from items = 99 + 83 + 56 = 238
   - Agent 1's total valuation from items = 82 + 71 + 64 + 11 = 228

   Each agent receives a total valuation close to their fair share, making the allocation fair.

Thus, the final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair portion of the total valuation.
