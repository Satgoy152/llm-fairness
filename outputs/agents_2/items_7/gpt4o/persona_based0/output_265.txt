Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  91  61  81  20  92  94
1   5  99  75  97  91  32  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1) while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

First, let's summarize the problem using the matrix provided:

```
        Item 0  Item 1  Item 2  Item 3  Item 4  Item 5  Item 6
Agent 0    41      91      61      81      20      92      94
Agent 1     5      99      75      97      91      32      76
```

To allocate the items fairly, we will use a strategic approach to minimize envy:

1. **Item-by-item consideration:** We will choose items for each agent such that their total perceived value is maximized while ensuring fairness. 
2. **Choose items with highest differential value:** Assign items based on the largest difference in valuations, prioritizing the agent who values the item more significantly higher.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: Agent 0 values this at 41, while Agent 1 values it at 5. (Differential: 36)
  - Item 5: Agent 0 values this at 92, while Agent 1 values it at 32. (Differential: 60)
  - Item 6: Agent 0 values this at 94, while Agent 1 values it at 76. (Differential: 18)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 1: Agent 1 values this at 99, while Agent 0 values it at 91. (Differential: 8)
  - Item 2: Agent 1 values this at 75, while Agent 0 values it at 61. (Differential: 14)
  - Item 3: Agent 1 values this at 97, while Agent 0 values it at 81. (Differential: 16)
  - Item 4: Agent 1 values this at 91, while Agent 0 values it at 20. (Differential: 71)

This allocation minimizes potential envy by ensuring each agent receives items they highly value compared to the other agent.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 three items and Agent 1 four items, maximizing their respective perceived values and maintaining fairness.
