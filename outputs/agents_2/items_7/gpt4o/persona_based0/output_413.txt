Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  71  28  49  55  23  64
1  27  20  32  11  58  75  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items to the agents, we should aim for envy-freeness, meaning that neither agent should prefer the allocation of the other agent over its own. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation is 316.
- Agent 1's total valuation is 257.

An allocation strategy that minimizes envy is to assign items such that each agent's total value from their allocated items is as close as possible to half of their total valuation. Let's try to find an allocation that balances the total value each agent receives from their items.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **High-value items**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 1 (71) and item 6 (64). 
   - Agent 1 highly values item 5 (75) and item 4 (58).

2. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Assign item 1 and item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 5 and item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items left: 0, 2, 3.

4. **Balancing the remaining items**:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 55 and item 6 at 64; since item 4 is already assigned to Agent 1, assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 26).
   - Now, assign the remaining items 2 and 3 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the total value for each agent:

- **Agent 0's total value**: 26 (item 0) + 71 (item 1) + 64 (item 6) = 161
- **Agent 1's total value**: 32 (item 2) + 11 (item 3) + 58 (item 4) + 75 (item 5) = 176

This allocation provides a reasonably balanced distribution based on their valuations.

### JSON Allocation Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
