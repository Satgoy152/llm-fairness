Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  90   2  20  46  10  28
1  56  19  88  72  77  12  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[32 90  2 20 46 10 28]
 [56 19 88 72 77 12 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

```
Agent 0: [32, 90, 2, 20, 46, 10, 28]
Agent 1: [56, 19, 88, 72, 77, 12, 42]
```

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 32 + 90 + 2 + 20 + 46 + 10 + 28 = 228
- Total value for Agent 1: 56 + 19 + 88 + 72 + 77 + 12 + 42 = 366

To achieve a fair allocation, we want each agent to receive a similar percentage of their total valuations:

1. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 90, which is significantly higher than Agent 1's valuation of 19. Allocating this item to Agent 0 greatly increases their total perceived value.

2. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 88, whereas Agent 0 values it at only 2. This item should go to Agent 1 to maximize their perceived value.

3. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 72, while Agent 0 values it at 20. Again, Agent 1 has a much higher valuation.

4. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 77, significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation of 46.

5. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 56, compared to Agent 0's valuation of 32.

6. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 0**:
   - Both agents have low valuations for item 5, but Agent 0's valuation of 10 is slightly lower than Agent 1's 12, so it can be seen as a balance allocation for Agent 0.

7. **Allocate item 6 to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 6 at 28, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 42, but this distribution helps balance the total value received.

After allocation, the perceived values are:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 5, 6] with a total value of 90 + 10 + 28 = 128
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 2, 3, 4] with a total value of 56 + 88 + 72 + 77 = 293

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value for each agent based on their initial valuations and minimizes potential envy.
