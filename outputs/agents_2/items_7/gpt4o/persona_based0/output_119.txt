Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0  1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  4  35  85  92  93  13
1  59  3   3  76  55   4  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can utilize the concept of envy-freeness. This means that each agent should believe that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation according to their own valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: 
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 2 + 4 + 35 + 85 + 92 + 93 + 13 = 324
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 59 + 3 + 3 + 76 + 55 + 4 + 48 = 248

2. **Identify High-Value Items**:
   - For Agent 0, the highest-value items are: 5 (93), 4 (92), and 3 (85).
   - For Agent 1, the highest-value items are: 0 (59), 3 (76), and 6 (48).

3. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Allocate items based on the highest values for each agent while trying to maintain a balance.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 since it is highly valued by both agents, but much more so by Agent 0.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 as it is highly valued by them.

4. **Balance the Allocation**:
   - Assign items 5 and 4 to Agent 0 because they are among their top valued items.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1, another of their high-valued items.
   - Assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 1 to balance the number of items while ensuring no envy.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items 3, 4, 5
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 1, 2, 6

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives items with high cumulative value according to their preferences, while Agent 1 also receives a set of items that include their top preferences. This setup aims to minimize envy between the agents.
