Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  51  79  75  29  74  77
1  25  25  99  52  78  67  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives items with high personal value. An envy-free allocation would mean each agent values their own bundle at least as much as they value the bundle of the other agent. However, given the discrete nature of the items and the integer constraint, achieving perfect envy-freeness may not be possible, but we can aim for a balanced allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [96, 51, 79, 75, 29, 74, 77]
- Agent 1 values: [25, 25, 99, 52, 78, 67, 48]

We want to assign items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A potential strategy is to assign the highest-valued items to each agent, alternating between them to balance the total value.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0's Highest Valuations**: 96, 79, 75, 77
2. **Agent 1's Highest Valuations**: 99, 78, 67

To balance the allocation:
- Assign Agent 0 the items they value most: 0 (96), 2 (79), 6 (77)
- Assign Agent 1 the items they value most: 2 (99), 4 (78), 5 (67)

We need to adjust since item 2 is assigned to both, and we have to ensure a total of 7 items are allocated. Let's refine that:

- Agent 0: 0, 3, 6 (Total Value: 96 + 75 + 77 = 248)
- Agent 1: 2, 4, 5, 1 (Total Value: 99 + 78 + 67 + 25 = 269)

This allocation gives Agent 0 three items and Agent 1 four items, with a focus on maximizing their respective values.

### Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 5, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated.
