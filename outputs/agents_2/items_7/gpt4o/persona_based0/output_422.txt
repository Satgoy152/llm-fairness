Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  78   1  99  29  25  87
1  99  58  67  45  11  28  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that neither agent envies the other. This can be achieved by maximizing the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations. Here is a step-by-step approach to find an envy-free allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 71 + 78 + 1 + 99 + 29 + 25 + 87 = 390
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 99 + 58 + 67 + 45 + 11 + 28 + 65 = 373

2. **Initial Assignment Based on Highest Valuation per Item:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:
     - Item 0: Agent 1 (99 vs 71)
     - Item 1: Agent 0 (78 vs 58)
     - Item 2: Agent 1 (67 vs 1)
     - Item 3: Agent 0 (99 vs 45)
     - Item 4: Agent 0 (29 vs 11)
     - Item 5: Agent 0 (25 vs 28)
     - Item 6: Agent 0 (87 vs 65)

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   - We need to ensure both agents receive an approximately fair share based on their total valuations.
   - Check the current allocation:
     - Agent 0 has items [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]
     - Agent 1 has items [0, 2]
   - Current total value for each agent:
     - Agent 0: 78 + 99 + 29 + 25 + 87 = 318
     - Agent 1: 99 + 67 = 166

4. **Balance the Allocation:**
   - To balance the allocation more fairly:
     - Move item 0 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 71, and Agent 1 values it at 99)
     - Move item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 0 values it at 25, and Agent 1 values it at 28)

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 4, 6, 0]
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 5]

6. **Verify Total Allocations:**
   - Agent 0's new total valuation: 78 + 99 + 29 + 87 + 71 = 364
   - Agent 1's new total valuation: 67 + 28 = 95

Given this allocation, both agents have a portion of items that reflect their preferences without obvious envy, considering the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 6, 0],
    "1": [2, 5]
}
```
