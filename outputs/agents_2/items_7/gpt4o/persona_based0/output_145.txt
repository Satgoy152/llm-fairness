Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  47  30  19  37  44  85
1  46  67  29  50   8  95  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to agents, we aim for envy-freeness where possible, meaning each agent should value their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent. We have two agents and seven items to allocate, and we aim to maximize fairness given the valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [22, 47, 30, 19, 37, 44, 85]
- Agent 1: [46, 67, 29, 50, 8, 95, 44]

To approach this, we can use a method like the envy-free allocation where each item is allocated to the agent that values it the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 46, which is more than Agent 0's 22. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 67, which is more than Agent 0's 47. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 30, which is more than Agent 1's 29. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 50, which is more than Agent 0's 19. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 37, which is more than Agent 1's 8. Allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 95, which is more than Agent 0's 44. Allocate to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 85, which is more than Agent 1's 44. Allocate to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 2, 4, and 6.
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 1, 3, and 5.

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 5]
}
```
