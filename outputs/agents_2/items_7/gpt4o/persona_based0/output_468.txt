Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  58  14  34  77  73  11
1  70   0  66  18  74  27  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a simple heuristic approach. Here's a step-by-step allocation plan:

1. **Initial Considerations:**
   - There are 2 agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1) and 7 items.
   - Each agent has different valuations for each item.

2. **Total Valuation Calculation:**
   - Calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items.
     - Agent 0: 77 + 58 + 14 + 34 + 77 + 73 + 11 = 344
     - Agent 1: 70 + 0 + 66 + 18 + 74 + 27 + 65 = 320

3. **Fair Division Heuristic:**
   - Distribute items one by one to the agent who values the item higher, ensuring each agent gets close to half of their total valuation.
   - Start by assigning items with the highest difference in valuation between the two agents.

4. **Allocation Process:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 at 70. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 at 0. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 at 66. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 at 18. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 at 74. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 at 27. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 11, Agent 1 at 65. Assign to Agent 1.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Ensure both agents have some items and the total number of items is 7.

6. **Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 6]
}
```

Each agent is assigned items in a way that reflects their valuations and aims to minimize envy. Agent 0 receives 5 items, and Agent 1 receives 2 items, which is balanced given the overall higher valuation by Agent 0.
