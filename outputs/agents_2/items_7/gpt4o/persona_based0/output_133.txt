Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4  5   6
0  78  11  26  13  51  0  97
1  67  71   6   6  28  5  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy, meaning each agent should feel that they received a fair share based on their valuations. 

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0's total valuation:**
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 11
  - Item 2: 26
  - Item 3: 13
  - Item 4: 51
  - Item 5: 0
  - Item 6: 97
  - **Total = 276**

- **Agent 1's total valuation:**
  - Item 0: 67
  - Item 1: 71
  - Item 2: 6
  - Item 3: 6
  - Item 4: 28
  - Item 5: 5
  - Item 6: 42
  - **Total = 225**

Next, we need to allocate the items such that the perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible. We can consider the following steps:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - For Agent 0, their highest value items are 6 (97), 0 (78), and 4 (51).
   - For Agent 1, their highest value items are 1 (71), 0 (67), and 6 (42).

2. **Allocate items to minimize envy:**
   - Assign the highest value items to the respective agents to maximize their satisfaction:
     - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (97 vs 42).
     - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (67 vs 78, but this allows a more balanced distribution of total perceived value).
     - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (51 vs 28).
     - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (71).
   - For the remaining items, continue to allocate by considering the remaining values:
     - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (26 vs 6).
     - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (6 vs 13, but this balances Agent 1's total perceived value).
     - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (5 vs 0).

3. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent after allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 6 (97), 4 (51), 2 (26) = 174
   - Agent 1: Items 0 (67), 1 (71), 3 (6), 5 (5) = 149

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives based on their individual valuation scale, while also ensuring that the total number of items (7) is fully allocated.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4, 2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 5]
}
```
