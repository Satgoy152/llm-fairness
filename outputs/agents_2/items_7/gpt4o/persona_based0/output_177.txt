Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  41  36  79  60  39  40
1  49  46  16  39   8  49  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocation given to the other agent. Here's how we can achieve this:

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Item Valuation Review:**
   - Agent 0's total value for all items: 383
   - Agent 1's total value for all items: 256

2. **Initial Considerations:**
   - Agent 0 has generally higher valuations for most items compared to agent 1.
   - We want to ensure each agent gets the items they value the most, while keeping the distribution fair.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Begin by assigning the highest valued items for each agent based on their preferences.
   - Adjust the allocation to ensure both agents have a roughly equal total valuation of the items they receive.

4. **Execution:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 88 vs 49).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 41 vs 46; however, we will adjust this later to balance the total value).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 36 vs 16).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 79 vs 39).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 60 vs 8).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 39 vs 49).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 40 vs 49).

5. **Final Adjustment for Envy-freeness:**
   - After initial assignment, Agent 0 has items [0, 1, 2, 3] with a total valuation of 244.
   - Agent 1 has items [4, 5, 6] with a total valuation of 147.
   - To make the allocation fairer, shift item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.
   - Now, Agent 0 has items [0, 2, 3] with a total valuation of 203.
   - Agent 1 has items [1, 4, 5, 6] with a total valuation of 180.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents get items that are of high value to them, and the overall valuation distribution is more balanced, adhering to the principles of fair division and envy-freeness.
