Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  81  98  53  62  20   6
1  95  45   8  40  68  97  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the valuations. One method to achieve this is to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while trying to balance the total value across agents.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would get with different potential allocations and choose the one that minimizes envy. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share relative to their preferences.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 81
  - Item 2: 98
  - Item 3: 53
  - Item 4: 62
  - Item 5: 20
  - Item 6: 6

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 45
  - Item 2: 8
  - Item 3: 40
  - Item 4: 68
  - Item 5: 97
  - Item 6: 39

Let's try to allocate the items in a way that balances the total valuation received by each agent. One approach is to start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent and then balance the remaining items.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Highest Valuation Consideration:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest (98).
   - Agent 1 values Item 5 the highest (97).

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0: 34, 81, 53, 62, 20, 6
   - Agent 1: 95, 45, 8, 40, 68, 39

4. **Allocate Remaining Items to Balance Total Value:**
   - Assign Item 0 and Item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 1, Item 3, and Item 6 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, 3, 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 4, 5.

### Valuation Calculation

- Agent 0's total valuation: 81 (Item 1) + 98 (Item 2) + 53 (Item 3) + 6 (Item 6) = 238
- Agent 1's total valuation: 95 (Item 0) + 68 (Item 4) + 97 (Item 5) = 260

Although the total valuation is slightly imbalanced, this allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences and ensures that both agents receive a significant portion of their highest-valued items.

### Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 4, 5]
}
