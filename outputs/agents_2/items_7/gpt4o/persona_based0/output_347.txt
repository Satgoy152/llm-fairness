Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  62  10  66  74  45  61
1  60  77  23   4  41  72  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent ends up with a bundle that they value highly, ideally minimizing any sense of envy between the agents.

The total value each agent assigns to all items combined is calculated as follows:

- Agent 0: 43 + 62 + 10 + 66 + 74 + 45 + 61 = 361
- Agent 1: 60 + 77 + 23 + 4 + 41 + 72 + 13 = 290

Given these total valuations, we will try to allocate the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value.

One possible way to allocate the items could be:

1. Assign items to Agent 0 by considering their higher valuations on specific items compared to Agent 1.
2. Assign the remaining items to Agent 1.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values items 4 and 3 highly, with values 74 and 66 respectively. Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values items 1 and 5 highly, with values 77 and 72 respectively. Assign these items to Agent 1.
3. Agent 0 values item 0 more than Agent 1, with a value of 43 compared to Agent 1's 60. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it more).
4. Agent 0 values item 2 more than Agent 1, with a value of 10 compared to Agent 1's 23. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it more).
5. Finally, assign the remaining item 6 to Agent 0.

Thus, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0: [3, 4, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 5]

This allocation takes into account the higher valuations each agent has for certain items while ensuring all items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5]
}
```
