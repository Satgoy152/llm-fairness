Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  27  13  52  45  20  24
1   1  37  26  15  65  18  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair, given their valuations. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, considering that each item can only be allocated to one agent.

Here are the steps to achieve a fair and envy-free allocation:

1. **Determine Total Values**: Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.

    - Agent 0's total value: 22 + 27 + 13 + 52 + 45 + 20 + 24 = 203
    - Agent 1's total value: 1 + 37 + 26 + 15 + 65 + 18 + 22 = 184

2. **Initial Allocation by Highest Valuation**: Allocate items one by one based on which agent values the item more.

    - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 1. Allocate to Agent 0.
    - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 27, Agent 1 values it at 37. Allocate to Agent 1.
    - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 values it at 26. Allocate to Agent 1.
    - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 52, Agent 1 values it at 15. Allocate to Agent 0.
    - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 values it at 65. Allocate to Agent 1.
    - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 values it at 18. Allocate to Agent 0.
    - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 values it at 22. Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Check Total Allocated Values**: Ensure each agent receives an approximate equal share of their total valuation.

    - Agent 0's allocated value: 22 + 52 + 20 + 24 = 118
    - Agent 1's allocated value: 37 + 26 + 65 = 128

4. **Adjust Allocation for Envy-Freeness**: Adjust if necessary to balance the perceived fairness. However, in this case, the allocations are already quite balanced given the constraints.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 7 items distributed. Both agents have a reasonable share of their perceived total value, aiming for envy-freeness under the given valuations.
