Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  63  65   9  60  25  11
1  37  90  96  42  34  83  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1), we need to consider how each agent values each item. We aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free and fair as possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the Total Valuation for Each Agent**: This helps us understand the total value each agent sees in the items.
   - Agent 0's total valuation: \(21 + 63 + 65 + 9 + 60 + 25 + 11 = 254\)
   - Agent 1's total valuation: \(37 + 90 + 96 + 42 + 34 + 83 + 60 = 442\)

2. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: We need to identify which items are particularly valuable to each agent:
   - Agent 0: Items 2 (65), 4 (60), and 1 (63) are highly valued.
   - Agent 1: Items 2 (96), 1 (90), and 5 (83) are highly valued.

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Individual Valuations**:
   - Start by allocating items that each agent values significantly higher than the other:
     - Item 2 is valued at 96 by Agent 1 and 65 by Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 1.
     - Item 1 is valued at 90 by Agent 1 and 63 by Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 1.
     - Item 5 is valued at 83 by Agent 1 and 25 by Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Remaining items: 0, 3, 4, 6.
   - Consider the remaining valuations and distribute them to balance the perceived fairness:
     - Item 0: Valued at 21 by Agent 0 and 37 by Agent 1. Allocate to Agent 1.
     - Item 3: Valued at 9 by Agent 0 and 42 by Agent 1. Allocate to Agent 1.
     - Item 4: Valued at 60 by Agent 0 and 34 by Agent 1. Allocate to Agent 0.
     - Item 6: Valued at 11 by Agent 0 and 60 by Agent 1. Allocate to Agent 0.

By this allocation, both agents end up with a collection of items that they value reasonably well.

Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
