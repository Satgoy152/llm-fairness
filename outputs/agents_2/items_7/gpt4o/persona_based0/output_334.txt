Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  97  48  40  54  94  32
1  77  70   9  56  35   3  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness (or as close as possible given the constraints), we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they receive a fair share, given their individual valuations.

Let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(86 + 97 + 48 + 40 + 54 + 94 + 32 = 451\)
- Agent 1: \(77 + 70 + 9 + 56 + 35 + 3 + 19 = 269\)

Then, let's determine allocations such that each agent receives items they value highly and attempt to balance the overall perceived value between the two agents.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 1 and 5.
2. **Agent 1** places relatively high values on items 0 and 3.

We'll allocate items to prioritize minimizing envy by assigning items largely based on the relative preferences:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 77, which is high for them).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 97, which is the highest valuation).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 48, higher than Agent 1's 9).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 56, higher than their other options).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 54, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 94, which is quite high).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 19, relatively low, but it's the remaining item).

This allocation aims at minimizing envy by giving each agent items they value highly given the constraints.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 6]
}
```
