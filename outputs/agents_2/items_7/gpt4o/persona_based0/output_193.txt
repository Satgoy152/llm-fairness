Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  91  15  29  12  63  66
1  43  87  34  47  53  55  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness and ensure each agent perceives their allocation as fair given their valuation of the items. Let's consider the valuations provided:

```
Agent 0: [98, 91, 15, 29, 12, 63, 66]
Agent 1: [43, 87, 34, 47, 53, 55, 51]
```

One way to approach this is to use the "divide and choose" method or similar strategies to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. In this case, we'll try to balance the total value each agent perceives in their allocation.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent would assign to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 98 + 91 + 15 + 29 + 12 + 63 + 66 = 374
- Total value for Agent 1: 43 + 87 + 34 + 47 + 53 + 55 + 51 = 370

Now, let's find a fair allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 0:** Agent 0 values this highly (98), so allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Allocate Item 1:** Agent 0 values this highly (91), so allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Allocate Item 2:** Agent 1 values this more (34 vs 15), so allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Allocate Item 3:** Agent 1 values this more (47 vs 29), so allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Allocate Item 4:** Agent 1 values this more (53 vs 12), so allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Allocate Item 5:** Agent 0 values this more (63 vs 55), so allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Allocate Item 6:** Agent 0 values this more (66 vs 51), so allocate to Agent 0.

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 5, 6
  - Total value for Agent 0: 98 + 91 + 63 + 66 = 318
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 4
  - Total value for Agent 1: 34 + 47 + 53 = 134

This allocation provides a relatively fair distribution according to each agent's valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
