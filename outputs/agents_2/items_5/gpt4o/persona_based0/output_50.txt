Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  60  75  57  91
1  34  97  70  37  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's perceived utility from the allocation. The aim is to allocate items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuation of the items.

Let's outline a strategy to achieve this:

1. **Total Valuation Calculation**: Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items to understand their overall valuation landscape.

   - Agent 0's total valuation: 29 + 60 + 75 + 57 + 91 = 312
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 34 + 97 + 70 + 37 + 20 = 258

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy**: Since the agents have different valuations, start by allocating the items one at a time, always giving the item to the agent who values it more, which is a simple form of maximizing individual satisfaction without regard to envy.

3. **Balanced Allocation**: Since there are 5 items and 2 agents, one agent will receive 3 items and the other 2. We need to ensure that the agent with fewer items still feels they have received a fair share.

4. **Consideration of Envy**: We will adjust allocations if needed to minimize any envy. This will involve swapping items if necessary, to ensure each agent feels they have a fair amount even if they have fewer items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 34, Agent 0 values it at 29. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 97, Agent 0 values it at 60. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 values it at 70. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 values it at 37. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 values it at 20. Allocate to Agent 0.

After initially allocating based on the highest value, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 4 (Total value for Agent 0: 75 + 57 + 91 = 223)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1 (Total value for Agent 1: 34 + 97 = 131)

This allocation gives Agent 0 more items and more value. To minimize envy, we can adjust by swapping an item if necessary. However, given the constraints, this allocation already attempts to maximize each agentâ€™s satisfaction with no further swaps that could reduce envy significantly.

Final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
