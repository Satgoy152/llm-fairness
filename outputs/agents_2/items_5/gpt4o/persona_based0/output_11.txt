Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  55  74  50  16
1  77  16  80  50  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 16 80 50 85]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuation each agent assigns to each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair, with no envy towards the other agent's allocation.

Given the valuation table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 85     | 55     | 74     | 50     | 16     |
| 1     | 77     | 16     | 80     | 50     | 85     |

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 2, assigning them values of 85 and 74, respectively.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 2 and 4, assigning them values of 80 and 85, respectively.

To ensure a fair division, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0** receives items 0 and 3. The total valuation for Agent 0 in this allocation is 85 (item 0) + 50 (item 3) = 135.
- **Agent 1** receives items 2, 1, and 4. The total valuation for Agent 1 in this allocation is 80 (item 2) + 16 (item 1) + 85 (item 4) = 181.

This allocation minimizes envy since:

- Agent 0 receives their most valued item (item 0).
- Agent 1 receives their most valued item (item 4) and next highly valued item (item 2).

In JSON format, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 1, 4]
}
```
