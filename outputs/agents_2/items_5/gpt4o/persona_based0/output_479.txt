Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  39  99   1  32
1  23  46  75  89   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the integer constraint on the number of items each agent receives. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to the other agent more than their own bundle.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent places on the items:

- Agent 0's valuations: [89, 39, 99, 1, 32]
- Agent 1's valuations: [23, 46, 75, 89, 0]

Agent 0's total value: 89 + 39 + 99 + 1 + 32 = 260  
Agent 1's total value: 23 + 46 + 75 + 89 + 0 = 233

To achieve a fair allocation, we consider the items' values for each agent and try to balance the total value assigned to each agent. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Assign items with high individual value to the agents who value them the most.
2. Try to ensure that the total value of items each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Assign item 0 (value 89) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 (value 99) to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 (value 89) to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 (value 46) to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 (value 32) to Agent 0.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 2, 4], with a total value of 89 + 99 + 32 = 220.
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 3], with a total value of 46 + 89 = 135.

While this allocation may not be perfectly envy-free due to the integer allocation constraint, it attempts to balance the total value of items each agent receives based on their individual valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize fairness given the agents' valuations.
