Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0  1   2   3   4
0  87  8  29  74  51
1  68  3  72   2  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for every item. We aim to distribute items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Here are the valuations provided:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 87
  - Item 1: 8
  - Item 2: 29
  - Item 3: 74
  - Item 4: 51

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 68
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 72
  - Item 3: 2
  - Item 4: 27

A common method for achieving envy-freeness is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation would be:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 87, and Agent 1 values it at 68. 
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 8, and Agent 1 values it at 3. 
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 29, and Agent 1 values it at 72. 
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 74, and Agent 1 values it at 2. 
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 51, and Agent 1 values it at 27. 
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives the items they value the most, while Agent 1 receives item 2, which they value higher than Agent 0. This allocation should minimize envy between the agents given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2]
}
```
