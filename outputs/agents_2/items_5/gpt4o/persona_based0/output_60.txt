Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57   6  97  29  99
1  96  48  67  71  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To approach the fair division problem with the goal of achieving envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items in such a way that each agent values their bundle at least as much as they value any other agent's bundle. This can be challenging given that there are only two agents and five items, but we can aim for a division that minimizes envy as much as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Valuation Table:**

   ```
   Agent 0: 57, 6, 97, 29, 99
   Agent 1: 96, 48, 67, 71, 67
   ```

2. **Identify High Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4 (99) and 2 (97).
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 (96) and 3 (71).

3. **Initial Allocation based on High Value Preferences:**
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value).

4. **Allocate Remaining Items to Minimize Envy:**
   - After the above allocation, remaining items are 1, 2, and 3.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (high value).
   - Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 1 to balance the number of items.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 2, 4
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 3

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they highly value, and the number of items is balanced between them.

### Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
