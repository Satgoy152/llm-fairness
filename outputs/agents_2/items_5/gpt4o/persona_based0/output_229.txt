Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15  19  92   7  76
1  63  33  63  52  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent feels that they have received a fair share of the total value, according to their own valuations. A common approach to achieve an envy-free allocation is to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as highly as the allocation of the other agent.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 15
  - Item 1: 19
  - Item 2: 92
  - Item 3: 7
  - Item 4: 76

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 63
  - Item 1: 33
  - Item 2: 63
  - Item 3: 52
  - Item 4: 87

To achieve a fair division, let's calculate the total value each agent perceives for all the items:

- **Agent 0 Total Valuation:** 15 + 19 + 92 + 7 + 76 = 209
- **Agent 1 Total Valuation:** 63 + 33 + 63 + 52 + 87 = 298

Now, let's try to distribute the items such that the perceived value for each agent is as close as possible to half of their total valuation, which would be:

- **Agent 0 Target Value:** 209 / 2 = 104.5
- **Agent 1 Target Value:** 298 / 2 = 149

To allocate the items:

1. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**: Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 0 at 92.
2. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1**: Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 1 at 87.
3. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1**: This adds 63 to Agent 1, making the total 150 for Agent 1 (87 + 63).
4. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0**: This adds 19 to Agent 0, making the total 111 for Agent 0 (92 + 19).
5. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 0**: This adds 7 to Agent 0, making the total 118 for Agent 0 (92 + 19 + 7).

This allocation gives each agent a significant portion of the total value according to their valuations, aiming for a fair division where both agents receive a value close to their target valuation.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
