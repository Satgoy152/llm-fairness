Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55   8   9  84  60
1  72  12  16  10  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 12 16 10 71]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and ensure that each agent feels that they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [55, 8, 9, 84, 60]
- Agent 1's valuations: [72, 12, 16, 10, 71]

We need to allocate the items such that each agent gets at least one item, and both agents are content with their allocation relative to their valuations.

One potential allocation strategy is as follows:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it the most (72).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it the most (84).
3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as they also value it highly (71 compared to Agent 0's 60).
4. Allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values them more than Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 3 with a total valuation of 101 (8 + 9 + 84).
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 4 with a total valuation of 143 (72 + 71).

Both agents receive their highest-valued item, and the allocation is envy-free since neither agent would prefer to switch with the other.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
