Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70   1  40  29  59
1  37  42  87  51  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that neither agent believes the other's allocation is more valuable than their own. One possible approach is to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, ensuring that the allocation is as balanced as possible according to their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [70, 1, 40, 29, 59]
- Agent 1: [37, 42, 87, 51, 80]

First, we calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 70 + 1 + 40 + 29 + 59 = 199
- Total value for Agent 1: 37 + 42 + 87 + 51 + 80 = 297

We will attempt to allocate the items so that each agent feels their allocation is fair given their valuation.

One possible fair allocation is:

- Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 0: Value = 70 + 40 = 110
- Assign items 1, 3, and 4 to Agent 1: Value = 42 + 51 + 80 = 173

This allocation gives Agent 0 a significant portion of their total valuation (110/199) and Agent 1 a significant portion of their total valuation (173/297). Both allocations respect the integer allocation requirement and ensure each agent receives at least half of their total valuation, making it a fair distribution considering envy-freeness.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
