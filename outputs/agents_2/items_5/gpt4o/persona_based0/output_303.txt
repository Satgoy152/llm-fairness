Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  82  22  20  37
1   0   1  78  70  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0  1 78 70 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. The goal is also to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, meaning that each agent should not prefer the allocation of the other agent over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 72
  - Item 1: 82
  - Item 2: 22
  - Item 3: 20
  - Item 4: 37

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 0
  - Item 1: 1
  - Item 2: 78
  - Item 3: 70
  - Item 4: 11

To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation, we can assign the items as follows:

- Assign items to maximize total valuation for each agent while ensuring no envy:
  - Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 1.
  - Agent 1 highly values items 2 and 3.

Considering this, a potential allocation could be:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.

This allocation ensures that:
- Agent 0 receives a total value of 72 (item 0) + 82 (item 1) + 37 (item 4) = 191.
- Agent 1 receives a total value of 78 (item 2) + 70 (item 3) = 148.

Both agents receive their highest-valued items without envy, as neither would prefer the other's allocation given the valuation differences.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
