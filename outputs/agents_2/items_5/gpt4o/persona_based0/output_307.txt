Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  40  19  37  62
1   6   9  97   0  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where both agents feel they receive a fair share based on their valuations. In this scenario, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives, often referred to as the "maximin" approach. 

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(63 + 40 + 19 + 37 + 62 = 221\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(6 + 9 + 97 + 0 + 87 = 199\)

Next, we will attempt to make allocations that maximize each agent's utility relative to their total valuation and ensure that no agent envies the other's bundle.

Let's evaluate the importance of each item to both agents:
- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 63, Agent 1 values it at 6.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 values it at 9.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 values it at 97.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 values it at 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 values it at 87.

To achieve a fair allocation:
1. Assign items that are highly valued by one agent and less so by the other.
2. Balance the total value assigned to each agent.

Following these principles, we can make the following allocation:
- Give Agent 0 the items: 0, 1, and 3.
- Give Agent 1 the items: 2 and 4.

Let's verify the allocations:
- Agent 0's allocation: Items 0, 1, 3 with values 63, 40, and 37. Total = 140.
- Agent 1's allocation: Items 2, 4 with values 97 and 87. Total = 184.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations, and it minimizes envy since each agent is receiving items that they value highly compared to the other.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
