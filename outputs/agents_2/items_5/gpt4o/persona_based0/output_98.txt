Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57  16  97  90  48
1   0  65  73  87  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution as much as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items given to another agent over their own bundle.

First, let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [57, 16, 97, 90, 48]
- Agent 1's valuations: [0, 65, 73, 87, 96]

Each agent should receive a set of items that maximizes their valuation while ensuring fairness. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial High-Value Allocation**: Start by allocating the item with the highest valuation to each agent.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (97).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (96).

2. **Second High-Value Allocation**: Allocate the next highest valued item to each agent, considering the remaining items.
   - For Agent 0, item 3 has the next highest value (90).
   - For Agent 1, item 3 has a value of 87, but item 1 has a value of 65, which is the next highest available for them, since item 3 is a better choice for Agent 0.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items to balance the allocation and maintain the highest possible total valuation for both agents.
   - Agent 0 has items [2, 3].
   - Agent 1 has items [4, 1].

4. **Allocate the Last Item**: The remaining item (item 0) should be allocated to the agent that derives more value from it without causing envy.
   - Agent 0's valuation for item 0 is 57.
   - Agent 1's valuation for item 0 is 0.

Therefore, allocating item 0 to Agent 0 ensures that both agents have their highest valued items and minimizes envy.

The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations and aims to be as envy-free as possible given the constraint of integer allocations.
