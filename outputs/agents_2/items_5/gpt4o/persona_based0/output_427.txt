Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  92  15  13  87
1   3  16  52  69  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the agents, we need to ensure that neither agent envies the allocation of the other. One common criterion to achieve this is the Envy-Free (EF) allocation, where each agent believes they received an allocation at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation according to their own valuation.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 48
  - Item 1: 92
  - Item 2: 15
  - Item 3: 13
  - Item 4: 87

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 3
  - Item 1: 16
  - Item 2: 52
  - Item 3: 69
  - Item 4: 61

To ensure fairness, we can attempt to allocate items such that the total value of items each agent receives is as balanced as possible according to their individual valuations.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0** tends to value Item 1 and Item 4 highly.
2. **Agent 1** values Item 2 and Item 3 more than others.

A possible fair allocation to minimize envy could be:

- **Agent 0** receives items 0 and 1.
- **Agent 1** receives items 2, 3, and 4.

Let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0's allocation:**
  - Items 0 and 1: 48 + 92 = 140

- **Agent 1's allocation:**
  - Items 2, 3, and 4: 52 + 69 + 61 = 182

While the total values are not identical due to the integer allocation constraint, each agent receives items they value highly, and the difference in total value is reasonable given the small number of items. This allocation minimizes envy given the constraint that each agent must receive whole items.

### Allocations in JSON format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
