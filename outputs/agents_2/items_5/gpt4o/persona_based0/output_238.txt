Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  79  29  61  20
1  40  81  66  12  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum total valuation each agent receives. This is often referred to as the "maximin" approach. Let's evaluate the valuations and try to allocate the items optimally.

### Agent Valuations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 52
  - Item 1: 79
  - Item 2: 29
  - Item 3: 61
  - Item 4: 20

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 81
  - Item 2: 66
  - Item 3: 12
  - Item 4: 42

### Strategy:
1. **Item 1** has the highest valuation for both agents. 
2. **Item 2** has a high valuation for Agent 1.
3. **Item 3** has a high valuation for Agent 0.
4. **Item 0** and **Item 4** have lower valuations and can be distributed based on maximizing fairness.

Let's allocate the items to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

- Assign **Item 1** to Agent 1 (81) because it maximizes their value.
- Assign **Item 3** to Agent 0 (61) because it maximizes their value.
- Assign **Item 0** to Agent 0 (52), as it provides a better balance given the remaining items.
- Assign **Item 2** to Agent 1 (66), as Agent 1 values it highly.
- Assign **Item 4** to Agent 1 (42) to balance the values.

### Allocations:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 3
- **Agent 1:** Items 1, 2, 4

### Total Valuation:

- **Agent 0:** 52 (Item 0) + 61 (Item 3) = 113
- **Agent 1:** 81 (Item 1) + 66 (Item 2) + 42 (Item 4) = 189

The allocation maximizes the minimum valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fair division, taking into account the highest possible value for each agent given the constraints.
