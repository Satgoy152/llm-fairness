Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  24  16  63  21
1  36  64  31  56  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. In this context, we will try to allocate the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their valuations.

**Valuations Table:**

- Agent 0: [96, 24, 16, 63, 21]
- Agent 1: [36, 64, 31, 56, 19]

**Steps to Allocate:**

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (96) and item 3 (63).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (64) and item 3 (56).

2. **Prioritize Allocations to Maximize Individual Satisfaction:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 because it has the highest value (96) for them.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 because it has the highest value (64) for them.

3. **Consider Remaining Items:**
   - For Agent 0, after item 0, the next high-value item is item 3 (63), but Agent 1 also values item 3 (56).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 to maximize their overall valuation.
   
4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 1 can be allocated item 2, which has a moderate value (31) for them.
   - Finally, allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as it is the least valued item for both agents, and Agent 1 needs another item to balance the allocation.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
