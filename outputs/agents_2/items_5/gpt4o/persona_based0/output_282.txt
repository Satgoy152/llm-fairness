Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  23  98  52   2
1  79  85  54  95  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 88
  - Item 1: 23
  - Item 2: 98
  - Item 3: 52
  - Item 4: 2

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 54
  - Item 3: 95
  - Item 4: 95

The goal is to maximize fairness and minimize envy. Given the valuations, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 2** has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (98) and a relatively lower valuation for Agent 1 (54). Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 3** has a high valuation for both agents but is more valuable for Agent 1 (95 vs. 52). Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 0** is valuable to both agents, but more so to Agent 0 (88 vs. 79). Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 1** has a high valuation for Agent 1 (85) and a lower one for Agent 0 (23). Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4** is equally valued by Agent 1 (95) compared to its other assigned items but not as valued by Agent 0 (2). To balance the allocation, assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent perceives they receive:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1, 3, and 4.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
