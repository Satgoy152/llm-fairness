Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  60  37  68  90
1  84  99   1  78  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division and envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they receive a fair share according to their valuations. In this setup, we have two agents and five items, with each agent having their distinct valuation for each item. A common approach is to maximize the minimum utility or use an envy-free allocation where each agent receives a bundle of goods they value at least as much as any other agent's bundle, considering their own valuations.

Let's consider the valuations of each agent:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [35, 60, 37, 68, 90]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [84, 99, 1, 78, 93]

Given these valuations, a possible allocation could be:

1. Assign items to each agent by maximizing the sum of their valuations for their respective allocations.
2. Ensure envy-freeness by assigning items such that no agent would prefer the other's allocation given their own valuations.

Based on this approach, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets items that maximize their utility without causing envy from Agent 1.
- Agent 1 gets the remaining items such that they are satisfied with their allocation.

After analyzing the valuations, a fair allocation is:

- Assign items [0, 2, 3] to Agent 0
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 35 (item 0) + 37 (item 2) + 68 (item 3) = 140
- Assign items [1, 4] to Agent 1
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 99 (item 1) + 93 (item 4) = 192

This allocation is fair because:

- Agent 0 gets a total valuation of 140 for their items.
- Agent 1 gets a total valuation of 192 for their items.
- Each agent has a non-negative valuation for their allocated items, and the allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value, thus reducing envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
