Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

   0   1   2   3   4
0  2  56  10  28   7
1  9  96  85  10  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the agents' valuations and aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations given:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 2      | 56     | 10     | 28     | 7      |
| 1     | 9      | 96     | 85     | 10     | 45     |

One way to approach this is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that the distribution is envy-free.

- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (56) and item 3 second highest (28).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (96) and item 2 second highest (85).

A possible fair distribution could be:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 because they value it much higher (96) compared to Agent 0 (56).
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because their valuation (85) is significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation (10).
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 because their valuation (28) is higher than Agent 1's valuation (10).
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 because their valuation (2) is lower than Agent 1's (9), and Agent 1 is already receiving high-value items.
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 because their valuation (7) is lower than Agent 1's (45), and Agent 1 has received high-value items already.

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation and minimize envy between the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
