Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  19  93  76  12
1  20  50  35  25  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Let's first consider the valuations of each agent for the items:

- Agent 0's valuations: 9, 19, 93, 76, 12
- Agent 1's valuations: 20, 50, 35, 25, 52

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we will try to distribute the items such that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation compared to the other agent's allocation.

1. **Allocate Item 2:**  
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 93, which is the highest single valuation among all items. Allocating Item 2 to Agent 0 seems reasonable because it would make them less envious of any other allocation.

2. **Allocate Item 1:**  
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 at 50, which is significant. Allocating Item 1 to Agent 1 ensures they receive a high-valued item in their perspective.

3. **Allocate Item 3:**  
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 at 76. Allocating Item 3 to Agent 0 gives them another high-valued item, balancing the high valuation of Item 1 given to Agent 1.

4. **Allocate Item 4:**  
   - Agent 1 values Item 4 at 52, which is their second-highest valuation. This allocation compensates for Agent 0 receiving both Items 2 and 3.

5. **Allocate Item 0:**  
   - Finally, Item 0 is valued at 9 by Agent 0 and 20 by Agent 1. Allocating Item 0 to Agent 1 rounds out their allocation, giving them a slight edge in total value, which helps balance the high valuations received by Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to be envy-free given the constraints and the agents' valuations. Agent 0 receives high-valued items 2 and 3, while Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 4, which balance the total value they derive from their allocation.
