Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94   5  95  58  17
1  42  83  83  42  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value from the items they receive. One common approach is to look for allocations that minimize envy or maximize the minimum satisfaction level of the agents.

Let's consider the valuations:
- Agent 0's valuations: [94, 5, 95, 58, 17]
- Agent 1's valuations: [42, 83, 83, 42, 53]

We need to find an allocation that is as fair as possible. A possible fair allocation method is to utilize the method of "divide and choose" or "max-min fairness" to ensure that envy is minimized.

Here is one method to fairly allocate the items:

1. Calculate total values for each potential allocation.
2. Choose the allocation that minimizes envy.

Let's try the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items: 1 and 4.

Now let's calculate the total valuations for this allocation:

- Agent 0: 94 (item 0) + 95 (item 2) + 58 (item 3) = 247
- Agent 1: 83 (item 1) + 53 (item 4) = 136

Both agents receive items, and the allocation minimizes envy because Agent 0 is receiving the items they value highly, and Agent 1 is receiving the items they value most after that.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
