Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  49   7   5  37
1  16  48  50  12  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while minimizing envy, we can consider the valuations provided by each agent and aim for an envy-free division.

Let's start by evaluating each agent's preferences:

- **Agent 0**'s valuations:  
  - Item 0: 45  
  - Item 1: 49  
  - Item 2: 7  
  - Item 3: 5  
  - Item 4: 37  

- **Agent 1**'s valuations:  
  - Item 0: 16  
  - Item 1: 48  
  - Item 2: 50  
  - Item 3: 12  
  - Item 4: 78  

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **High-Valuation Items**:  
   - Agent 1 highly values item 4 (78) and item 2 (50).
   - Agent 0 highly values item 1 (49) and item 0 (45).

2. **Assign Items to Meet High Valuations**:
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

3. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 3 and some other unassigned item need to be allocated.
   - Since Agent 0 has a lower valuation for item 3 and has already received high-value items, we can allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Only item 3 and 0 remain to be assigned to Agent 0.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3.
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 4.

This allocation respects the high valuations of each agent and aims to minimize potential envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
