Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  74  98  85  38
1  51   4  57  13  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while minimizing envy, we'll consider each agent's valuations for the items. Our goal is to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the other agent values their respective allocation.

Here are the steps we'll follow:

1. **List the valuations** for each agent:
   - Agent 0: [79, 74, 98, 85, 38]
   - Agent 1: [51, 4, 57, 13, 86]

2. **Sort the items for each agent** by descending value:
   - Agent 0: [(2, 98), (3, 85), (0, 79), (1, 74), (4, 38)]
   - Agent 1: [(4, 86), (2, 57), (0, 51), (3, 13), (1, 4)]

3. **Determine allocations** to minimize envy:
   - Start allocating the highest-valued items from each list, ensuring each agent receives items they highly value.

4. **Allocate items**:
   - Agent 0 receives the highest-valued item from their list: Item 2.
   - Agent 1 receives the highest-valued item from their list: Item 4.
   - Continue allocating alternately to balance the valuation:
     - Agent 0 receives Item 0 (next highest in their list).
     - Agent 1 receives Item 3 (next highest in their list).
     - Agent 0 receives Item 1 (next in their list).

By this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items [2, 0, 1] with total valuation = 98 + 79 + 74 = 251
- Agent 1 receives items [4, 3] with total valuation = 86 + 13 = 99

This allocation ensures both agents receive items they value highly, minimizing envy.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 1],
    "1": [4, 3]
}
```
