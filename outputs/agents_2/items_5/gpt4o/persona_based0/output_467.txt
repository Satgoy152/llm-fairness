Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  15   9  50  17
1  44   9  47  97  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division and aim for envy-freeness, we need to allocate items to the agents in a way that considers their valuations. The goal is to minimize envy, where each agent should feel they have received at least as much value as the other agent in their own valuation perspective.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [59, 15, 9, 50, 17]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [44, 9, 47, 97, 10]

The total value each agent assigns to all the items is:
- Agent 0: 59 + 15 + 9 + 50 + 17 = 150
- Agent 1: 44 + 9 + 47 + 97 + 10 = 207

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0's highest valued items: Item 0 (59), Item 3 (50)
   - Agent 1's highest valued items: Item 3 (97), Item 2 (47)

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**:
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 because it's the highest valued item for Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 because it's the highest valued item for Agent 0.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Check the remaining high-value items: 
     - Agent 0: Item 1 (15), Item 4 (17)
     - Agent 1: Item 2 (47)
   
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 because it's the next highest valued item for Agent 1.
   - Assign Items 1 and 4 to Agent 0 as they provide some value and no other high-priority allocations for Agent 1.

4. **Final Allocation Check**:
   - Ensure all items are allocated and each agent feels they have received a fair allocation based on their valuations.

### Final Allocation

Considering these calculations and logic, we can allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy and provide a fair distribution of items based on each agent's valuations. Agent 0 receives items they value more, while Agent 1 receives items that maximize their total value.
