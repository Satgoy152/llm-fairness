Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  16  25  14  64
1  28  31  37  70  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that the allocations are envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(23 + 16 + 25 + 14 + 64 = 142\)
- Agent 1: \(28 + 31 + 37 + 70 + 54 = 220\)

Since the total sum of values is different for each agent, achieving a perfect envy-free allocation might not be possible, but we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy.

Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Assign high-value items:** Allocate items with high valuations to the agent who values them more.
2. **Balance remaining items:** Distribute the remaining items to balance the perceived fairness.

Let's break it down:

- Item 3 has a high value for Agent 1 (70), so allocate it to Agent 1.
- Item 4 has a high value for Agent 0 (64), so allocate it to Agent 0.
- Item 2 has a higher value for Agent 1 (37 vs 25), so allocate it to Agent 1.
- Item 1 has a higher value for Agent 1 (31 vs 16), so allocate it to Agent 1.
- Item 0 has a higher value for Agent 1 (28 vs 23), but Agent 0 needs more items, so allocate it to Agent 0.

This allocation is designed to minimize the envy by giving each agent the items they value most while ensuring each agent receives a similar number of items.

Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, and 3.
