Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  58  23  94  78
1  79  32  22  50  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or minimizing envy between agents. Let's analyze the valuation of each agent for each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: [13, 58, 23, 94, 78]
- Agent 1's valuations: [79, 32, 22, 50, 33]

The goal is to allocate the items such that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation.

Let's calculate the total valuation of each agent for all items:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 13 + 58 + 23 + 94 + 78 = 266
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 79 + 32 + 22 + 50 + 33 = 216

One way to approach this is to assign items based on relative valuations. We can start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring a balanced distribution of total valuations.

Allocation strategy:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (79 vs. 13), assign to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (58 vs. 32), assign to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (23 vs. 22), assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (94 vs. 50), assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (78 vs. 33), but to balance allocations, assign to Agent 1.

After this allocation:

- Agent 0 has items: [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 1 has items: [0, 4]

Letâ€™s check the total values each agent gets:

- Agent 0: 58 (Item 1) + 23 (Item 2) + 94 (Item 3) = 175
- Agent 1: 79 (Item 0) + 33 (Item 4) = 112

This allocation might not be perfect in terms of equal total valuations, but it minimizes envy by trying to balance the allocation based on individual item preferences.

Here are the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
