Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  12  83  22  82
1  89  70  66  91  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 70 66 91 17]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received an equal or better share compared to others. 

Here's the valuation table for reference:

```
Agent 0: [1, 12, 83, 22, 82]
Agent 1: [89, 70, 66, 91, 17]
```

Let's consider the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(1 + 12 + 83 + 22 + 82 = 200\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(89 + 70 + 66 + 91 + 17 = 333\)

Given their valuations, we aim to allocate the items to minimize envy between the agents. Here's one potential allocation:

1. Start by allocating items based on the highest individual valuations:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 highest (91), so give item 3 to agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 highest (83), so give item 2 to agent 0.

2. Continue allocating based on next highest valuations to ensure a balanced overall valuation:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 second highest (89), so give item 0 to agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 4 second highest (82), so give item 4 to agent 0.

3. The remaining item:
   - Item 1 is left, which agent 1 values more (70 compared to agent 0's 12). Thus, assign item 1 to agent 1.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
  - Total valuation for agent 0: \(83 + 82 = 165\)
  
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 3]
  - Total valuation for agent 1: \(89 + 70 + 91 = 250\)

While this allocation doesn't equalize the total valuation due to the initial imbalance, it is structured to minimize envy by prioritizing each agent's highest-valued items. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
