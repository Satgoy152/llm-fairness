Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  41  15  22  51
1  23  97  17  70  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can utilize the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. The goal is to split the items such that both agents are as satisfied as possible with their allocations.

Let's look at the valuations of each item for both agents:

- Agent 0's valuations: [35, 41, 15, 22, 51]
- Agent 1's valuations: [23, 97, 17, 70, 77]

One approach is to try and balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's explore a potential allocation strategy.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Find the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (51).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (97).

2. **Assign these high-value items to each respective agent:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate the remaining items to balance the overall valuation:**
   - Remaining items: [0, 2, 3]

4. **Calculate potential allocations by considering remaining items:**
   - For Agent 0: Consider items [0, 2, 3], with valuations 35, 15, 22 respectively.
   - For Agent 1: Consider items [0, 2, 3], with valuations 23, 17, 70 respectively.

5. **Assign remaining items to balance valuations:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 35), because it contributes significantly to their total value.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 70), as it offers high value to them.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 15).

6. **Check total valuations:**
   - Agent 0 receives items [4, 0, 2] with a total valuation of 51 + 35 + 15 = 101.
   - Agent 1 receives items [1, 3] with a total valuation of 97 + 70 = 167.

While this allocation might not perfectly balance the total valuations, it ensures each agent receives high-value items according to their preferences, which is a step towards envy-freeness.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets an integer number of items.
