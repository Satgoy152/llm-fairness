Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  77  49  87  76
1  21  23  10  24  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair or envy-free. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, considering their valuations.

Firstly, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(67 + 77 + 49 + 87 + 76 = 356\)
- Agent 1: \(21 + 23 + 10 + 24 + 49 = 127\)

Next, we consider the proportional share, which is the total value divided by the number of items. For agent 0, this is \(356 / 5 = 71.2\), and for agent 1, this is \(127 / 5 = 25.4\). Ideally, each agent should receive items whose total valuation is close to or greater than these proportional shares for envy-freeness.

To allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highly values items 3 and 1, with values 87 and 77 respectively.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest, with a value of 49.

With this in mind, let's allocate:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as it has the highest value for them.
2. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as it is their most valued item.
3. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as it is the next highest valued item for them.
4. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as it is also highly valued by them.
5. Assign item 2 to agent 1, since agent 0 already has a significant share of high-valued items.

This allocation should ensure both agents receive a fair share relative to their valuations while meeting the integer constraint for item allocation.

Final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
