Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80   8  67   6  80
1  37  56  19  70  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming to minimize envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility for each agent based on their respective valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction while keeping the allocation envy-free as much as possible.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [80, 8, 67, 6, 80]
- Agent 1: [37, 56, 19, 70, 90]

One approach is to allocate items in a way that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent. To do this, we can evaluate different allocations and assess which configuration provides a fair division without envy.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1:** 
   - Agent 1 values this item the highest at 90.
   
2. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values this item the highest at 80.

3. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values this item at 70, which is relatively high compared to Agent 0.

4. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values this item at 67, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 19.

5. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1:**
   - To maximize Agent 1's remaining value, this item is valued at 56 by Agent 1, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 8.

This allocation can be checked for envy-freeness by comparing the total values each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2: Total value = 80 + 67 = 147
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, and 4: Total value = 56 + 70 + 90 = 216

While this allocation results in a higher total value for Agent 1, each agent has been given items they value highly relative to the other agent's valuations, reducing the potential for envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
