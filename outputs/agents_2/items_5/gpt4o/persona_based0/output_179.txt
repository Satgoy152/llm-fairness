Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  95  84   2  61
1  13  32  51  43  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value that each agent receives from their allocation. We need to consider the relative valuations of the items by both agents to ensure that neither agent envies the allocation of the other.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [39, 95, 84, 2, 61]
- Agent 1: [13, 32, 51, 43, 16]

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Item 1** should go to Agent 0 because they value it the highest (95 vs 32).
2. **Item 2** should go to Agent 0 because they value it significantly higher (84 vs 51).
3. **Item 3** should go to Agent 1 because they value it higher (43 vs 2).
4. **Item 4** should go to Agent 0 because they value it higher (61 vs 16).
5. **Item 0** should go to Agent 1 as it balances the allocation and Agent 0 already has high-value items.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the distribution is as fair as possible given the valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
