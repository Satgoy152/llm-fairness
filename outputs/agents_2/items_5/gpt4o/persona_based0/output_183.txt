Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  77  22   2  13
1   5  98   1  17  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 77 22  2 13]
 [ 5 98  1 17 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we strive to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent values their allocated bundle at least as much as the bundle allocated to the other agent.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [99, 77, 22, 2, 13]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [5, 98, 1, 17, 59]

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initial High-Value Item Allocation:**

   - **Agent 0:** The highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 (value = 99).
   - **Agent 1:** The highest value for Agent 1 is item 1 (value = 98).

   Assign:
   - Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Remaining Items:**

   - Remaining items are 2, 3, and 4.

3. **Next Highest Value Allocation:**

   - **Agent 0:** Next highest value item is item 2 (value = 22).
   - **Agent 1:** Next highest value item among remaining is item 4 (value = 59).

   Assign:
   - Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Item 4 to Agent 1.

4. **Final Item Allocation:**

   - The remaining item is 3.
   - **Agent 0 values item 3 at 2**, and **Agent 1 values item 3 at 17**.

   Since Agent 1 values item 3 more than Agent 0, assign item 3 to Agent 1.

### Allocation Result:

Based on the above allocations, the final distribution is:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 2]
- Agent 1 receives items: [1, 4, 3]

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value highly, and no agent envies the other's allocation more than their own.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4, 3]
}
```
