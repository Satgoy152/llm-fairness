Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  62   5  87  96
1  23  94  32  85  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to ensure that the allocations respect principles of fairness, such as envy-freeness, wherever possible. The goal is to distribute the items such that neither agent envies the other, meaning each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value the other agent's allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [32, 62, 5, 87, 96]
- Agent 1's valuations: [23, 94, 32, 85, 84]

To achieve a fair division, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 32 + 62 + 5 + 87 + 96 = 282
   - Agent 1: 23 + 94 + 32 + 85 + 84 = 318

2. **Aim for a Balanced Division**:
   - Total valuation of all items: 282 + 318 = 600
   - Each agent should ideally have items valued at around 300 in total based on their own valuations to achieve a balance.

3. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation Differences**:
   - Prioritize items where the valuation difference between agents is largest, as it can help minimize envy.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 values it at 84. Assign to Agent 0 (since 96 is higher).
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 94, Agent 0 values it at 62. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 values it at 85. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 values it at 23. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 32, Agent 0 values it at 5. Assign to Agent 1.

This allocation yields:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 3, 0 (valued at 96, 87, 32) = Total value 215
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2 (valued at 94, 32) = Total value 126

The allocation can be adjusted to balance total value, but given the constraint of integer allocations and maximizing each agent's total valuations, this is a reasonable allocation under the conditions.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
