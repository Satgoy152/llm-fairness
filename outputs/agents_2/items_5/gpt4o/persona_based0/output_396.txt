Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  40   6   8  82
1   6  94  91  62  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to it as possible. This means that each agent should feel that they have received at least as much value as the other agent from their perspective.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0: 80, Item 1: 40, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 8, Item 4: 82
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0: 6, Item 1: 94, Item 2: 91, Item 3: 62, Item 4: 64

Now, let's consider how to allocate these items to maximize fairness:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this highly (80), while Agent 1 values it low (6). Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this highest (94), while Agent 0 values it at (40). Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 has a high valuation (91), whereas Agent 0 has a low valuation (6). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this at (62) which is higher than Agent 0's valuation (8). Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values this highly (82), while Agent 1's valuation is lower (64). Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 4].
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 2, 3].

This allocation respects the agents' preferences to a reasonable extent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
