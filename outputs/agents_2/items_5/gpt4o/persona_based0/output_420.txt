Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  55  64  86  85
1  13  73  85  90  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 33      | 13      |
| 1    | 55      | 73      |
| 2    | 64      | 85      |
| 3    | 86      | 90      |
| 4    | 85      | 35      |

The total value of all items for each agent is:

- Agent 0: 33 + 55 + 64 + 86 + 85 = 323
- Agent 1: 13 + 73 + 85 + 90 + 35 = 296

To achieve a fair allocation, let's consider maximizing each agent's perceived value of their allocated items.

**Step 1: Initial Allocation**

1. Allocate items based on the highest personal valuations:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (86).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest as well (90). However, since Agent 1 values item 2 (85) almost as much, we can give item 3 to Agent 0 initially.

2. Proceed with the next highest valuations:
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (85), Item 2 (64)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (85), Item 1 (73)

**Step 2: Resolve Conflicts and Optimize**

Given the initial allocation, we need to resolve conflicts and optimize for each agent. Let's distribute the items:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0: [3] (86)
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1: [2] (85)
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1: [1] (73)

Now we have:
- Agent 0 has item 3.
- Agent 1 has items 2 and 1.

To allocate the remaining items (0 and 4):

- Agent 0 values item 4 highly, so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Agent 0 also values item 0 higher than Agent 1, so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

**Final Allocation**

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0's total value: 33 (item 0) + 86 (item 3) + 85 (item 4) = 204
- Agent 1's total value: 73 (item 1) + 85 (item 2) = 158

Both agents receive items, and the distribution respects the higher valuations for each agent. The allocation is not perfectly envy-free but maximizes each agent's perceived value.
