Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  53  85  74  58
1   1  63  37  91  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 1 63 37 91 86]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation with the goal of minimizing envy, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. Envy-freeness implies that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation to their own, based on their individual valuation.

Let's review the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [51, 53, 85, 74, 58]
- Agent 1's valuations: [1, 63, 37, 91, 86]

A straightforward approach is to allocate items based on the highest value each agent places on them, starting with the items where the valuation differences are most significant.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 91, while Agent 0 values it at 74.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 because they have a significantly higher valuation.

2. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 85, while Agent 1 values it at 37.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 because they have a significantly higher valuation.

3. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 86, while Agent 0 values it at 58.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 because they have a significantly higher valuation.

4. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 63, while Agent 0 values it at 53.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 because they have a higher valuation.

5. **Item 0**: 
   - Finally, Agent 0 values it at 51, while Agent 1 values it at 1.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 because they have a significantly higher valuation.

### Resulting Allocation:

Agent 0 receives items [0, 2], and Agent 1 receives items [1, 3, 4]. This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, minimizing the potential for envy.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
