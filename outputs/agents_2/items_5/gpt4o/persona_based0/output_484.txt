Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  55  68  59  59
1  71  27  96  89  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents while minimizing envy, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations provided by the agents:

- Agent 0: [26, 55, 68, 59, 59]
- Agent 1: [71, 27, 96, 89, 80]

To achieve an envy-free allocation (or as close as possible), we will aim to maximize each agent's value for their allocated items.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation:

1. Assign items to maximize each agent's valuation:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1: 96).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1: 89).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (third highest value for Agent 1: 80).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0: 55).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0: 26).

By allocating items in this manner, we ensure that each agent receives items valued highly by them, minimizing potential envy.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 valuation: 26 (item 0) + 55 (item 1) = 81
- Agent 1 valuation: 96 (item 2) + 89 (item 3) + 80 (item 4) = 265

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
