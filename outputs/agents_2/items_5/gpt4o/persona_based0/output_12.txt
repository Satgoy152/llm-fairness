Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   7  56   3  86  37
1  11  81  79  72  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim for an envy-free division, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocation of the other agent. Here's how we can achieve that:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent Valuations**:
   - Agent 0 values: [7, 56, 3, 86, 37]
   - Agent 1 values: [11, 81, 79, 72, 85]

2. **Total Valuation per Agent**:
   - Agent 0 total valuation: \(7 + 56 + 3 + 86 + 37 = 189\)
   - Agent 1 total valuation: \(11 + 81 + 79 + 72 + 85 = 328\)

3. **Priority of Allocation**:
   - To minimize envy, we will consider allocating items based on the highest value difference between the two agents.

4. **Determine Value Differences**:
   - Item 0: \(11 - 7 = 4\)
   - Item 1: \(81 - 56 = 25\)
   - Item 2: \(79 - 3 = 76\)
   - Item 3: \(72 - 86 = -14\)
   - Item 4: \(85 - 37 = 48\)

5. **Allocate Items**:
   - **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 0 (Highest value for Agent 0)
   - **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 1 (Higher value difference favoring Agent 1)
   - **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 1 (Higher value difference favoring Agent 1)
   - **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 1 (Higher value difference favoring Agent 1)
   - **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 0 (Remaining item favoring Agent 0)

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0** receives items [3, 4]
- **Agent 1** receives items [0, 1, 2]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least some items and the envy is minimized given the initial valuations.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
