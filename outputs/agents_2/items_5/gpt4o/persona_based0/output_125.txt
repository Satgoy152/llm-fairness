Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77   4  83  45  70
1   6  11  40  97  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we need to allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as any other agent, from their own perspective.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0: 77 (item 0) + 4 (item 1) + 83 (item 2) + 45 (item 3) + 70 (item 4) = 279
- Agent 1: 6 (item 0) + 11 (item 1) + 40 (item 2) + 97 (item 3) + 53 (item 4) = 207

Now, we'll try to allocate the items such that each agent believes they have received at least half of their total valuation:

1. Calculate half of each agent's total value:
   - Agent 0: 279 / 2 = 139.5
   - Agent 1: 207 / 2 = 103.5

2. Start by allocating the items based on the highest individual valuations to approximate envy-freeness. 

3. Assign items based on their individual values to each agent, trying to maximize their perceived value while keeping the total number of items split correctly.

Let's analyze possible allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 (83) and item 0 (77) highly. Allocating these two items gives Agent 0 a total of 160, which is above their half-value (139.5).
- Agent 1 values item 3 (97) highly. Allocating item 3 to Agent 1 gives them 97, which is close to their half-value (103.5). To get closer, we can assign item 4 (53) to Agent 1, which raises their total to 150, well above their half-value.
- This leaves item 1, which has low value for both agents. However, it's best to allocate it to even out the number of items.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2 (total value = 160)
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 1 (total value = 161)

This allocation satisfies the condition of each agent receiving at least as much as they feel entitled to, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 1]
}
```
