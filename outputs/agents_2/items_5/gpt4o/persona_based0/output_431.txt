Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  13   8  81  36
1  35  98  82  53  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Let's analyze the valuations of the agents for each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: [75, 13, 8, 81, 36]
- Agent 1's valuations: [35, 98, 82, 53, 56]

A reasonable approach is to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that the overall allocation is balanced in terms of total value perceived by each agent. 

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value: Item 3 (81)
   - Second-highest value: Item 0 (75)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value: Item 1 (98)
   - Second-highest value: Item 2 (82)

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0:** This is Agent 0's highest-valued item.
2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1:** This is Agent 1's highest-valued item.
3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0:** This is Agent 0's second-highest valued item.
4. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:** This is Agent 1's second-highest valued item.
5. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1:** This balances the allocation, as Agent 1 has higher values for the remaining items compared to Agent 0.

Now letâ€™s check the values each agent receives:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0 and 3 -> Values: 75 + 81 = 156
- **Agent 1:** Items 1, 2, and 4 -> Values: 98 + 82 + 56 = 236

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's utility based on their preferences and results in a fair distribution given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
