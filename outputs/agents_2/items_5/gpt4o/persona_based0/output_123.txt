Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  71  75   2  28
1  60  94  39  76   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to consider an allocation where the agents feel no envy for each other's allocations, if possible. This often involves maximizing the total perceived value for each agent or ensuring that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuation matrix:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0 at 90
  - Item 1 at 71
  - Item 2 at 75
  - Item 3 at 2
  - Item 4 at 28

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 60
  - Item 1 at 94
  - Item 2 at 39
  - Item 3 at 76
  - Item 4 at 4

To find a fair allocation, we can use the method of maximizing the total valuation received by each agent, ensuring that each agent gets a set of items that they value highly relative to the other agent.

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

1. **Allocate Items with Highest Differential Valuation:**
   - **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 90, whereas Agent 1 values it at 60. Thus, it is more valuable to Agent 0.
   - **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it at 94, whereas Agent 0 values it at 71. Thus, it is more valuable to Agent 1.

2. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - **Item 2:** Both agents have relatively high valuations, but Agent 0 values it at 75 compared to Agent 1's 39.
   - **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it at 76, and Agent 0 values it at 2.
   - **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 28, and Agent 1 values it at 4.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, and 4
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 3

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations and minimizes envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
