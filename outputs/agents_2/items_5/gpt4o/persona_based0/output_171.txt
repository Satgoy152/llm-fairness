Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  43  55   2  86
1  24  70  86  97  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [24 70 86 97 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The principle of envy-freeness means no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [99, 43, 55, 2, 86]
Agent 1: [24, 70, 86, 97, 57]
```

We will proceed by examining the highest valuations for each agent and try to allocate the items in a way that is most satisfying and fair.

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (99), followed by item 4 (86).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most (97), followed by item 2 (86).

To ensure fairness and maximize value:
- Allocate item 0 and item 4 to Agent 0, as these are their highest valued items.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it is their second highest valued item after item 3.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as Agent 0 already has two high-value items and this item is valued higher by Agent 1 than the remaining options.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value and minimizes potential envy, as each agent receives items according to their preferences.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
