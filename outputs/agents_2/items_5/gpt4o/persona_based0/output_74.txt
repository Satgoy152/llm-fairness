Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  20  83  58  62
1  48  60  53  62  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy, ensuring that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their own valuations. This can be achieved by attempting to maximize the total value each agent receives, while also ensuring envy-freeness or as close to it as possible given the constraints.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 83
  - Item 3: 58
  - Item 4: 62

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 48
  - Item 1: 60
  - Item 2: 53
  - Item 3: 62
  - Item 4: 23

To start, let's find out which items each agent values the most and try to allocate accordingly.

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations:**
   - Item 0 (95), Item 2 (83), Item 4 (62)

2. **Agent 1's highest valuations:**
   - Item 1 (60), Item 3 (62), Item 2 (53)

A natural division based on highest valuations could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2, 4]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 3]

Checking the total value for each agent under this allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 95 (Item 0) + 83 (Item 2) + 62 (Item 4) = 240
- **Agent 1**: 60 (Item 1) + 62 (Item 3) = 122

This allocation ensures that each agent maximizes their total valuation under the constraint of fairness, as Agent 0 and Agent 1 both receive items they highly value. Although Agent 1 has fewer items, they receive the items they value the most, considering their preference list.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation respects the condition of distributing all 5 items and attempts to balance the agents' satisfaction with their allocation based on their valuations.
