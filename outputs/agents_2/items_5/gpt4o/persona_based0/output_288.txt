Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  52  99  56  48
1  68   2  44  21  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim for an allocation that maximizes fairness and minimizes envy. We'll strive for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels they are receiving the best possible set of items given their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [0, 52, 99, 56, 48]
- Agent 1: [68, 2, 44, 21, 23]

The total valuations for each agent across all items are:

- Total for Agent 0: 0 + 52 + 99 + 56 + 48 = 255
- Total for Agent 1: 68 + 2 + 44 + 21 + 23 = 158

To achieve a fair division, we need to ensure that each agent feels they receive a fair share based on their valuations.

One possible allocation is:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it's valued highly by them (99).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it's valued highly by them (68).
- For the remaining items (1, 3, 4), distribute them to balance the perceived value.

Let's compute this allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it's valued more than by Agent 1.
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it's valued significantly more by Agent 0.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, balancing the allocation.

This way, Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 3, and Agent 1 receives items 0 and 4. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation minimizes envy and provides each agent with items they value highly, given the constraints.
