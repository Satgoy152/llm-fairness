Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  13  53  82  31
1  40  78   1  48  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations of the items and attempt a division where each agent feels they have received a fair share.

Given the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 78  
- Item 1: 13  
- Item 2: 53  
- Item 3: 82  
- Item 4: 31  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 40  
- Item 1: 78  
- Item 2: 1  
- Item 3: 48  
- Item 4: 91  

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:  
- Total value for Agent 0 = 78 + 13 + 53 + 82 + 31 = 257  
- Total value for Agent 1 = 40 + 78 + 1 + 48 + 91 = 258  

Next, we aim to allocate the items so that the perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible. One approach is to allocate items based on the highest relative value each agent assigns to an item compared to the other agent. This helps in achieving an allocation that minimizes envy.

Let's examine each item's allocation:

1. **Item 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 78, while Agent 1 values it at 40.  
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (since 78 > 40).

2. **Item 1:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 13, while Agent 1 values it at 78.  
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (since 78 > 13).

3. **Item 2:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 53, while Agent 1 values it at 1.  
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (since 53 > 1).

4. **Item 3:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 82, while Agent 1 values it at 48.  
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (since 82 > 48).

5. **Item 4:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 31, while Agent 1 values it at 91.  
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (since 91 > 31).

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to achieve a fair division, taking into consideration each agent's relative valuation of the items.
