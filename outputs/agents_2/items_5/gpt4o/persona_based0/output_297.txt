Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  55  89  32  60
1  58  28  90  24  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that minimizes envy, we can utilize the concept of maximizing each agent's perceived value of their allocation. We will also ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 5 items are allocated.

Below is the table of valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   27   |   55   |   89   |   32   |   60   |
|   1   |   58   |   28   |   90   |   24   |   56   |

1. Start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: \(27 + 55 + 89 + 32 + 60 = 263\)
   - Agent 1: \(58 + 28 + 90 + 24 + 56 = 256\)

2. We want to allocate items such that the agents feel they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

3. Begin by assigning the item with the highest value to each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 89.
   - Agent 1 also values item 2 the most at 90, but we need to choose the allocation that maximizes each agent's total perceived value of their allocation.
   
4. Allocate other items to balance the perceived total value of each agent:
   - To agent 0, allocate items that maximize perceived value: item 2 (89) and item 4 (60).
   - To agent 1, allocate the remaining items: item 0 (58), item 1 (28), and item 3 (24).

The allocations aim to balance the perceived fairness based on each agent's value system while ensuring all items are distributed.

Therefore, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
