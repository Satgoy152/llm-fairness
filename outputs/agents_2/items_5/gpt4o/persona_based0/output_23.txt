Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  54   2  45  68
1  65  86  48  76  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should not prefer the allocation of the other agent to their own. Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 61     | 54     | 2      | 45     | 68     |
| 1     | 65     | 86     | 48     | 76     | 86     |

Let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 61 + 54 + 2 + 45 + 68 = 230
- Agent 1: 65 + 86 + 48 + 76 + 86 = 361

Now, let's explore an allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (68).
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (86).

To ensure fairness, we can give each agent the items they value most, and then fill out the allocation with remaining items:

- Give item 4 to Agent 0
- Give item 1 to Agent 1

Now, we have to allocate the remaining items: 0, 2, and 3.

- Item 0 has a higher value for Agent 1 (65 vs. 61), so give item 0 to Agent 1.
- Item 2 has a higher value for Agent 1 (48 vs. 2), so give item 2 to Agent 1.
- Finally, item 3 has a higher value for Agent 1 (76 vs. 45), but to maintain fairness in the number of items, give this item to Agent 0.

The allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items [3, 4]
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 1, 2]

This results in a fair allocation where both agents receive items, and the total number of items allocated is 5.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
