Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  28  95  64  56
1   8  44  34   7  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. This means that each agent should not prefer the other's allocation over their own. Here's how we can approach this distribution:

1. **Sum of Valuations**: First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items combined.

   - Agent 0: \(10 + 28 + 95 + 64 + 56 = 253\)
   - Agent 1: \(8 + 44 + 34 + 7 + 22 = 115\)

2. **Fair Share**: Each agent should ideally receive items that sum to at least half of their total valuation.

   - Fair share for Agent 0: \(253 / 2 = 126.5\)
   - Fair share for Agent 1: \(115 / 2 = 57.5\)

3. **Allocation Strategy**: Start by assigning items that maximize each agent's valuation while ensuring that both agents receive their fair share.

   - **Agent 0**: Highest valued items are 2 (95), 3 (64), and 4 (56). Choosing items 2 and 3 gives a valuation of 159, which exceeds the fair share.
   - **Agent 1**: Highest valued items are 1 (44) and 2 (34). However, item 2 is already assigned to Agent 0. Choosing items 1 (44) and 4 (22) gives a valuation of 66, which satisfies the fair share.

4. **Final Allocation**: Based on the strategy above, allocate the items as follows:

   - Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 4.

5. **Check Total Allocation**: Ensure that all items are allocated and no item is given to more than one agent.

   - Total items allocated: 5 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
