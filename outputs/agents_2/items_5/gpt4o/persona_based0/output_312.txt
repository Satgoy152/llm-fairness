Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95   8  89  20  22
1   0  20  76  36  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 20 76 36 79]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of the values each agent receives. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [95, 8, 89, 20, 22]
- Agent 1's valuations: [0, 20, 76, 36, 79]

We aim to allocate the items to maximize fairness and value perceived by each agent.

### Steps to Allocate:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation Items**:
   - For each agent, identify the items that they value the most.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**:
   - Allocate the items to agents in a way that maximizes their individual valuations while ensuring envy-freeness.

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness**:
   - An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Values item 0 the most (95).
  - Values item 2 highly as well (89).

- **Agent 1**:
  - Values item 4 the most (79).
  - Values item 2 and item 3 relatively highly (76 and 36 respectively).

### Proposed Fair Allocation:

- **Allocate to Agent 0**:
  - Item 0 (highest valuation) and item 2 (second highest valuation).

- **Allocate to Agent 1**:
  - Item 4 (highest valuation), item 3, and item 1 (to maximize total perceived value).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that are highly valued by them, leading to a fair distribution.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that:
- Agent 0 receives a total valuation of 184 (95 + 89).
- Agent 1 receives a total valuation of 135 (20 + 36 + 79).

Both agents receive their most valued items, and the allocation respects the integer constraint, as each item is only allocated once.
