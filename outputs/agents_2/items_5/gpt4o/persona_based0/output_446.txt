Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43   0  28  41   8
1  37  97  75  94  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their satisfaction and minimizes envy as much as possible.

### Valuations Matrix:
- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 43
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 28
  - Item 3: 41
  - Item 4: 8

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 37
  - Item 1: 97
  - Item 2: 75
  - Item 3: 94
  - Item 4: 68

### Total Valuations:
For a fair division, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Allocate items that Agent 0 values relatively highly compared to Agent 1.
   - Items: 0, 2, 4
   - Total Valuation: 43 (Item 0) + 28 (Item 2) + 8 (Item 4) = 79

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly.
   - Items: 1, 3
   - Total Valuation: 97 (Item 1) + 94 (Item 3) = 191

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items without any remaining, and attempts to balance the total valuations received.

### Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation is constructed to ensure that both agents receive items, and each agent gets an integer number of items, with all 5 items being allocated.
