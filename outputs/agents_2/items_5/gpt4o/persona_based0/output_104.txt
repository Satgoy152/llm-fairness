Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  40  86  14  37
1  14  38  25  50  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [14 38 25 50 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation if possible. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what the other agent received based on their own valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [11, 40, 86, 14, 37]
- Agent 1's valuations: [14, 38, 25, 50, 49]

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. First, allocate the highest valued items according to each agent's preferences.
2. Attempt to balance the total value each agent receives to minimize envy.

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 86, so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 50, so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Next, Agent 1 values item 4 at 49, which is their next highest, so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 at 40, which is quite high for them, so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Item 0**: Finally, allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it helps balance the total value.

**Allocated Items and Values:**

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2] with total valuation = 11 + 40 + 86 = 137
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4] with total valuation = 50 + 49 = 99

This allocation provides Agent 0 with a higher total valuation, but it is difficult to achieve perfect envy-freeness with such distinct valuations without more sophisticated techniques or additional resources. However, this allocation is fair in terms of each agent receiving a sizeable portion of their highly valued items.

**Final Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
