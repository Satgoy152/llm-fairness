Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  67  62  89  11
1  67  55  79  94  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. We will try to allocate the items in such a way that both agents are as satisfied as possible with their allocation, given their valuations.

The valuations for Agent 0 and Agent 1 are as follows:

- Agent 0: [66, 67, 62, 89, 11]
- Agent 1: [67, 55, 79, 94, 48]

One approach is to allocate items to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring a fair division.

1. **Allocate Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 89
   - Agent 1 values it at 94
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation)

2. **Allocate Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 62
   - Agent 1 values it at 79
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation)

3. **Allocate Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 67
   - Agent 1 values it at 55
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation)

4. **Allocate Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 66
   - Agent 1 values it at 67
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation)

5. **Allocate Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 11
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation)

After these allocations, the distribution is:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 3, 4]

However, to ensure a more balanced allocation, we can make adjustments. We aim for a fair distribution where neither agent envies the other's allocation.

After reevaluation, a feasible fair allocation can be:

- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0

This way, Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 4, and Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3. This should provide a balanced allocation based on their respective valuations:

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 values: 67 (Item 1) + 62 (Item 2) + 11 (Item 4) = 140
- Agent 1 values: 67 (Item 0) + 94 (Item 3) = 161

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
