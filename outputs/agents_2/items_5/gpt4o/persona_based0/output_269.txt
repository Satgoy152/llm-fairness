Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  31  92  39  60
1  88  30  44  99  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[61 31 92 39 60]
 [88 30 44 99 88]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that both agents feel they have received a fair share of the total value of the items. We'll use the valuations provided to guide the allocation process. Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

```
Agent 0: [61, 31, 92, 39, 60]
Agent 1: [88, 30, 44, 99, 88]
```

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 61 + 31 + 92 + 39 + 60 = 283
- Total value for Agent 1: 88 + 30 + 44 + 99 + 88 = 349

Next, we attempt to allocate the items to minimize envy by considering each agent's preferences and the sum of values each agent can receive. The goal is to ensure that no agent feels that the other has received a more valuable allocation.

A reasonable approach is to allocate based on the highest value items each agent perceives. Let's allocate:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 2 (value 92)
   - Item 0 (value 61)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3 (value 99)
   - Item 4 (value 88)
   - Item 1 (value 30)

Now, let's check the total value each agent receives with this allocation:

- Total value for Agent 0: 92 + 61 = 153
- Total value for Agent 1: 99 + 88 + 30 = 217

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of their perceived total value, and it respects their preferences. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3, 4, 1]
}
```
