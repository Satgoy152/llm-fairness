Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57  85  73  94  41
1  33  72  37  43  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, meaning that each agent should feel that they have received at least as much value as the other agent from the allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 57
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 73
  - Item 3: 94
  - Item 4: 41

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 37
  - Item 3: 43
  - Item 4: 66

We want to maximize each agent's perceived value while ensuring that each agent receives at least 2 items, as there are a total of 5 items and 2 agents.

One possible allocation is:

1. Assign item 1 and item 3 to Agent 0:
   - Total value for Agent 0 = 85 (item 1) + 94 (item 3) = 179
   - Total value for Agent 1 = 72 (item 1) + 43 (item 3) = 115

2. Assign item 0, item 2, and item 4 to Agent 1:
   - Total value for Agent 0 = 57 (item 0) + 73 (item 2) + 41 (item 4) = 171
   - Total value for Agent 1 = 33 (item 0) + 37 (item 2) + 66 (item 4) = 136

In this allocation, Agent 0 has a higher perceived value for their items, which can be considered fair given that they have higher individual valuations for these items compared to Agent 1. Meanwhile, Agent 1 receives more items, which balances the allocation. 

Thus, the allocation can be given as:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
