Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  13  39  39  95
1   1  95  45  72  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 94     | 13     | 39     | 39     | 95     |
| 1     | 1      | 95     | 45     | 72     | 59     |

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Agent 0** values Item 0 and Item 4 the highest (94 and 95, respectively), while **Agent 1** values Item 1 and Item 3 the highest (95 and 72, respectively).

2. Allocate Item 0 and Item 4 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuations for these items.

3. Allocate Item 1 and Item 3 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuations for these items.

4. Remaining Item 2 is valued at 39 by Agent 0 and 45 by Agent 1. Allocating Item 2 to Agent 1 would maximize their satisfaction with an additional high-value item.

With this strategy, both agents receive items that they value highly, minimizing envy between them.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 2]
}
```
