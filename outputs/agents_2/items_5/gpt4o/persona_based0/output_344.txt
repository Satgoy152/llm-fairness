Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  27  93   8  88
1  76  23  70  80  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we would ideally like to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 40 + 27 + 93 + 8 + 88 = 256
- Agent 1: 76 + 23 + 70 + 80 + 50 = 299

Now, let's work towards an allocation that minimizes envy. We can use a simple heuristic approach to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. However, this often doesn't result in an allocation where each agent receives the same number of items, so we will adjust if necessary to ensure balance.

2. Ensure that each agent receives a total of 2 or 3 items since there are 5 items in total.

Using this approach:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 76, Agent 0 at 40. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 27, Agent 1 at 23. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 at 70. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 80, Agent 0 at 8. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 at 50. Assign to Agent 0.

With this allocation, Agent 0 receives three items, and Agent 1 receives two items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 items 1, 2, and 4, and Agent 1 items 0 and 3, ensuring that all items are allocated and the total number of items is 5.
