Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  41  87  94  50
1  59  92  34  75  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [59 92 34 75 42]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels that they received items of value at least equal to what the other agent received.

The valuation matrix is as follows:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 53
  - Item 1: 41
  - Item 2: 87
  - Item 3: 94
  - Item 4: 50

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 92
  - Item 2: 34
  - Item 3: 75
  - Item 4: 42

To find an envy-free allocation, we will examine the valuations and try to balance the total value of the items each agent receives.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values Item 3 the most (valuation of 94), so we allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** highly values Item 1 the most (valuation of 92), so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 0** now aims to get as much value as possible. We allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (valuation of 87).

4. **Agent 1** takes Item 0 which they value at 59.

5. **Agent 1** takes the remaining Item 4, which they value at 42.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0's total value: 94 (Item 3) + 87 (Item 2) = 181
- Agent 1's total value: 92 (Item 1) + 59 (Item 0) + 42 (Item 4) = 193

Both agents feel they have received an equitable share based on their own valuations, and no agent envies the allocation of the other based on value.

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent's perceived value is balanced, minimizing envy and satisfying the condition of fair division.
