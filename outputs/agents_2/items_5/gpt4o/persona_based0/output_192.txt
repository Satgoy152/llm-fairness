Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   7  48  20  94  67
1  90  42   7  13  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while taking into account their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over that of the other agent.

Here are the valuations for the two agents:

- Agent 0 values: [7, 48, 20, 94, 67]
- Agent 1 values: [90, 42, 7, 13, 35]

To determine a fair allocation, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 3 (94), followed by item 4 (67).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0 (90), followed by item 1 (42).

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Allocate the items so that each agent receives the items they value the most, ensuring no envy is created.

3. **Envy-Free Allocation**:
   - Give item 3 to Agent 0, as it is the highest valued item by Agent 0.
   - Give item 4 to Agent 0, as it is the second-highest valued item by Agent 0.
   - Give item 0 to Agent 1, as it is the highest valued item by Agent 1.
   - Give item 1 to Agent 1, as it is the second-highest valued item by Agent 1.
   - The remaining item 2 can be allocated to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that they value highly, minimizing envy.

4. **Final Allocations**:
   - Agent 0 receives items: [2, 3, 4]
   - Agent 1 receives items: [0, 1]

Now, I will present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
