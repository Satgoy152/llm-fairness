Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  37  53  74  81
1  40  55  33  83  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free and, if possible, efficient. An envy-free allocation means that each agent should prefer their own allocation or value it at least as much as the allocation of the other agent. Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations: [87, 37, 53, 74, 81]  
Agent 1's valuations: [40, 55, 33, 83, 58]  

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent and explore possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Total value = 87 + 37 + 53 + 74 + 81 = 332

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Total value = 40 + 55 + 33 + 83 + 58 = 269

The goal is to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations. One possible starting point is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, but we must ensure the allocation remains envy-free.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it more (87 vs. 40), so assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it more (55 vs. 37), so assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it more (53 vs. 33), so assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it more (83 vs. 74), so assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it more (81 vs. 58), so assign to Agent 0.

Let's make sure this allocation is envy-free:

- **Agent 0's total value:** 87 (Item 0) + 53 (Item 2) + 81 (Item 4) = 221
- **Agent 1's total value:** 55 (Item 1) + 83 (Item 3) = 138

Both agents prefer their own allocations as Agent 0's total value (221) is higher with their items compared to any other combination, and similarly for Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation is envy-free based on the given valuations and ensures each agent gets items they value highly.
