Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  63  37  56  90
1  56  55   3  77   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to consider a concept known as "envy-freeness." A division is considered envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations of the items by each agent, we can try to allocate the items to minimize envy and maximize fairness.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [31, 63, 37, 56, 90]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [56, 55, 3, 77, 3]

One common approach to achieve a fair allocation is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We will aim to distribute the items such that the total value of items received by each agent is as balanced as possible, given their respective valuations.

First, let's examine the highest valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's highest valuation is for item 4 (value 90).
- Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 3 (value 77).

We can start by assigning these items based on the highest valuation:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

Now we have:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [3]

Remaining items: 0, 1, 2.

Next, let's consider the remaining items. We want to continue ensuring that the distribution is as fair as possible.

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it higher (56) than Agent 0 (31).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it higher (63) than Agent 1 (55).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it higher (37) than Agent 1 (3).

Based on this, we can allocate the remaining items as follows:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

Now, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: [1, 2, 4]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value based on their own valuations.

Finally, the allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
