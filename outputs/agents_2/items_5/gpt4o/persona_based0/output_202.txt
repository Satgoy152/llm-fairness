Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  81  51  30  26
1  25  24  43  33  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items considering envy-freeness, we need to allocate the 5 items between the 2 agents based on their valuations such that no agent prefers the allocation of the other agent over their own.

First, let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 28, Item 1: 81, Item 2: 51, Item 3: 30, Item 4: 26

- Agent 1 values: 
  - Item 0: 25, Item 1: 24, Item 2: 43, Item 3: 33, Item 4: 40

Our goal is to ensure both agents are satisfied with their allocations.

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - We allocate items that agent 0 values highly and that agent 1 values less by comparison. 
   - So, let's allocate items 1 and 2 to agent 0. 

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - We allocate items that agent 1 values relatively higher and are not already taken by agent 0.
   - Let's allocate items 3, 4, and 0 to agent 1.

### Allocation Details:

- Agent 0:
  - Items 1 and 2
  - Total valuation for agent 0: \(81 + 51 = 132\)

- Agent 1:
  - Items 3, 4, and 0
  - Total valuation for agent 1: \(33 + 40 + 25 = 98\)

This allocation minimizes envy as agent 0 has the higher total valuation, and agent 1 receives more items which somewhat compensates for lower total valuation. Each agent values their own allocation higher than the other's allocation.

### Final Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 0]
}
```
