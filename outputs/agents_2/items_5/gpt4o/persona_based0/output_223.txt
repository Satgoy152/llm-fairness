Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  71  93  63  22
1  61  79   7  30   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, as much as possible, given that each agent has different valuations for each item. An envy-free allocation is one where each agent believes they have received at least as much value as any other agent, given their own valuation of the items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [59, 71, 93, 63, 22]
- Agent 1: [61, 79, 7, 30, 0]

The total value each agent perceives for all items is:

- Agent 0: 59 + 71 + 93 + 63 + 22 = 308
- Agent 1: 61 + 79 + 7 + 30 + 0 = 177

To allocate fairly, we should consider giving higher valued items to the agent who values them most, whenever possible, while balancing the total perceived value.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 0 (93 vs. Agent 1's 7), so it goes to Agent 0.
2. Item 1 is valued higher by Agent 1 (79 vs. Agent 0's 71), so it goes to Agent 1.
3. Item 0 is valued almost equally (Agent 0's 59 vs. Agent 1's 61), but slightly more by Agent 1, so it goes to Agent 1.
4. Item 3 is valued higher by Agent 0 (63 vs. Agent 1's 30), so it goes to Agent 0.
5. Item 4 is valued higher by Agent 0 (22 vs. Agent 1's 0), so it goes to Agent 0.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
