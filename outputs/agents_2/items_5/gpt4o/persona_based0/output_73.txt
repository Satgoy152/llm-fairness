Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  59  26  54  91
1  68  82  14  50  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the total valuations. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

To approach this problem, we will calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and then attempt to distribute the items such that each agent gets items that maximize their perceived value.

Here are the valuations from the table:

- Agent 0: [73, 59, 26, 54, 91]
- Agent 1: [68, 82, 14, 50, 40]

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: \(73 + 59 + 26 + 54 + 91 = 303\)
- Total value for Agent 1: \(68 + 82 + 14 + 50 + 40 = 254\)

We will try to allocate the items such that the total value each agent gets is as equal as possible. To do this, we'll start by assigning items based on the highest value each agent assigns to each item.

1. **Assigning the highest valued items:**

   - Agent 0 highly values item 4 (value 91), so assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (value 82), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Assigning the next highest valued items:**

   - Agent 0's next highest value is item 0 (value 73), so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's next highest value is item 0 (value 68), but it's already assigned. The next highest is item 3 (value 50), so assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocating remaining items:**

   - The remaining items are 2 and 3. Item 3 is already assigned, so only item 2 is left.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 26, and Agent 1 values it at 14. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 4, 2] with total value = 73 + 91 + 26 = 190
- Agent 1: [1, 3] with total value = 82 + 50 = 132

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and no items are left unallocated. The allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation balances the total perceived value each agent receives, given their valuations.
