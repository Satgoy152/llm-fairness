Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  44  64  43  68
1   8  33   8  76  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that the distribution is as fair as possible. We will proceed by evaluating the values each agent assigns to each item and attempting to distribute items in a way that balances these valuations.

First, let's list the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [22, 44, 64, 43, 68]
- Agent 1's valuations: [8, 33, 8, 76, 20]

Next, let's consider the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 22 + 44 + 64 + 43 + 68 = 241
- Total value for Agent 1: 8 + 33 + 8 + 76 + 20 = 145

Given these totals, Agent 0 values the items more overall, but we aim to distribute the items to minimize envy and aim for a fair division based on individual item preferences.

Let's try the following allocation:

1. Assign items to the agent who values them the most:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 8. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 44, Agent 1 values it at 33. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 values it at 8. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 values it at 76. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 values it at 20. Assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the total value each agent receives in this allocation:

- Agent 0: 22 (Item 0) + 44 (Item 1) + 64 (Item 2) + 68 (Item 4) = 198
- Agent 1: 76 (Item 3) = 76

This allocation gives Agent 0 a higher total valuation, but it is important to note that Agent 0 values items more highly in general, and Agent 1 receives the item they value most (Item 3).

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3]
}
```
