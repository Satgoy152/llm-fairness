Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62   5  36  14  71
1   8  27  40  93  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that neither agent feels that the other's allocation is more valuable than their own.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 62  
  - Item 1: 5  
  - Item 2: 36  
  - Item 3: 14  
  - Item 4: 71  

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 8  
  - Item 1: 27  
  - Item 2: 40  
  - Item 3: 93  
  - Item 4: 86  

### Allocation Process:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0's highest valuation is for item 4 (71).
   - Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 3 (93).

2. **Assign High-Value Items:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because it is their highest valued item.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 because it is their highest valued item.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are 0, 1, and 2.

4. **Consider Remaining Valuations:**
   - For item 0:
     - Agent 0 values it at 62.
     - Agent 1 values it at 8.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it significantly more.

   - For item 1:
     - Agent 0 values it at 5.
     - Agent 1 values it at 27.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it significantly more.

   - For item 2:
     - Agent 0 values it at 36.
     - Agent 1 values it at 40.
   - The difference in valuations is small; we can assign this item to Agent 1 to balance the overall allocation.

5. **Review Allocations:**
   - Agent 0 has items 0 and 4.
   - Agent 1 has items 1, 2, and 3.

Given this distribution, both agents receive a total value that should reflect their preferences and minimize envy.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
