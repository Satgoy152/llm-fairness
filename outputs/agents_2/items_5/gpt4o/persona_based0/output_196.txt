Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  80  73  21  41
1   4  86  94  48  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we need to ensure that the division is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints. Since we have two agents and five items, each agent will receive either two or three items. The goal is to maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items while keeping the allocation fair.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent for their allocated items under different scenarios:

### Initial Valuation Matrix:
- Agent 0: [56, 80, 73, 21, 41]
- Agent 1: [4, 86, 94, 48, 90]

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Item 2**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (94 vs. 73), so allocate item 2 to agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (86 vs. 80), so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Item 4**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (90 vs. 41), so allocate item 4 to agent 1.

At this point, agent 1 has three items: [1, 2, 4]. Let's allocate the remaining two items to agent 0.

4. **Item 0**: Allocate to agent 0 since agent 1 already has three items.
5. **Item 3**: Allocate to agent 0 since agent 1 already has three items.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 4]

### Justification:
This allocation maximizes each agent's satisfaction given the constraints. Agent 1 receives the items they value the most, leading to a higher total valuation, while agent 0 receives the remaining items, which still have significant value.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.
