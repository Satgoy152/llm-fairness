Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  56  20  10  48
1  12  63  49  23  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair. The goal is to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints of integer allocations.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they receive all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 54 + 56 + 20 + 10 + 48 = 188
- Agent 1's total valuation: 12 + 63 + 49 + 23 + 97 = 244

Next, we want to allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. The sum of all valuations for both agents is 188 + 244 = 432.

Each agent should ideally receive items worth approximately half of the total valuation:

- Ideal share for Agent 0: 188 / 432 * 5 = ~2.17 items
- Ideal share for Agent 1: 244 / 432 * 5 = ~2.83 items

Since we have to allocate integer numbers of items, let's attempt allocations that respect these proportions as closely as possible while considering each agent's preference for individual items.

Let's consider the valuations directly to decide on the allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as they value it very highly (97) compared to Agent 0 (48).

2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it higher (63) compared to Agent 0 (56).

3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it significantly higher (54) compared to Agent 1 (12).

4. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it higher (49) compared to Agent 0 (20).

5. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 1 values it the least (23).

Now we finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 3]
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 2, 4]

This allocation is as balanced as possible given the constraints and each agent's preferences.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
