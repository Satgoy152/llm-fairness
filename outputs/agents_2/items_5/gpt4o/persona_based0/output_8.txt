Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0  1   2   3   4
0  42  6   9  13  66
1  20  9  88  77  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [20  9 88 77 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider both the individual valuations and the goal of achieving envy-freeness or minimizing envy as much as possible. Envy-freeness is a state where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [42, 6, 9, 13, 66]
- Agent 1's valuations: [20, 9, 88, 77, 69]

We need to allocate all 5 items between these two agents. Let's analyze the total value each agent assigns to the items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 42 + 6 + 9 + 13 + 66 = 136
- Total value for Agent 1: 20 + 9 + 88 + 77 + 69 = 263

To fairly allocate, we aim to balance the distribution such that both agents are satisfied with their allocations and any envy is minimized.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **High-value Items**
   - Agent 1 values item 2 (value 88) very highly. Allocating item 2 to Agent 1 minimizes potential envy as it is crucial to their perceived value.
   - Agent 1 also values item 3 highly (value 77), so it would be logical to assign this to Agent 1 to maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Balancing the Remaining Items**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most (value 66), so it should be allocated to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 also values item 0 significantly (value 42), which should go to Agent 0.
   - The remaining item (item 1) has a low value for both agents, but slightly higher for Agent 0. Allocating item 1 to Agent 0 can provide some additional satisfaction.

### Proposed Allocation

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 3

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items that are relatively important to them, and minimizes the potential envy between them.

### Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
