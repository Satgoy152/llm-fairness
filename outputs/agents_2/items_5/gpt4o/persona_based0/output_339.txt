Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  27  28  39  97
1  22  39  53  33  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll consider the valuations provided in the table. Our goal is to allocate the items such that the perceived value for each agent is maximized without generating envy. 

We have the following valuations:

- Agent 0: [13, 27, 28, 39, 97]
- Agent 1: [22, 39, 53, 33, 44]

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 13 + 27 + 28 + 39 + 97 = 204
- Total value for Agent 1: 22 + 39 + 53 + 33 + 44 = 191

Next, we'll use a simple heuristic: allocate items to the agent who values them the most, as long as this does not result in one agent getting all the items or an imbalanced allocation that results in significant envy.

1. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 97, whereas Agent 1 values it at 44. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 53, whereas Agent 0 values it at 28. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 39, whereas Agent 0 values it at 27. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 39, whereas Agent 1 values it at 33. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 22, whereas Agent 0 values it at 13. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: Item 4, Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 2, Item 1, Item 0

This allocation ensures that both agents get a fair share of the items based on their valuations, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
