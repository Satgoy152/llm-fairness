Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  22  10  11  36
1  34  30  49   7  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness (where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own), we need to allocate the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Let's examine the agents' preferences:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 25
- Item 1: 22
- Item 2: 10
- Item 3: 11
- Item 4: 36

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 34
- Item 1: 30
- Item 2: 49
- Item 3: 7
- Item 4: 23

First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
- Agent 0's total valuation: 25 + 22 + 10 + 11 + 36 = 104
- Agent 1's total valuation: 34 + 30 + 49 + 7 + 23 = 143

To aim for envy-freeness, we should try to allocate items so that each agent's share of their total valuation is proportional to the number of items they receive.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 1 highly values Item 2** (value 49, highest among all items). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0 highly values Item 4** (value 36, highest among remaining items). Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1's next highest value is for Item 0** (value 34). Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0's next highest value is for Item 1** (value 22). Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
5. **Only Item 3 remains**, and Agent 0 values it slightly higher than Agent 1. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

Now, let's examine the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1, 3, and 4, with a total valuation of 22 + 11 + 36 = 69.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of 34 + 49 = 83.

This allocation minimizes envy since both agents receive a fair share according to their preferences.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
