Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18   0  64  73  40
1  98  81  10  17  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a way that minimizes envy, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. An envy-free allocation aims to ensure that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 64
  - Item 3: 73
  - Item 4: 40

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 1: 81
  - Item 2: 10
  - Item 3: 17
  - Item 4: 35

A potential allocation strategy is to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free. One approach is to allocate the items to the agents based on their highest valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 1**: Highly values Item 0 and Item 1.
2. **Agent 0**: Highly values Item 2 and Item 3.

#### Allocation:

- Assign Items 0 and 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign Items 2 and 3 to Agent 0.
- The remaining item, Item 4, can be assigned to Agent 1, as it increases their total valuation without causing envy from Agent 0.

This gives the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Items [2, 3]
- Agent 1 receives Items [0, 1, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
