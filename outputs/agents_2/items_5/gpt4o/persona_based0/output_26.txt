Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  95  45  63  42
1  66  84  84  88  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66 84 84 88 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that neither agent feels envy towards the other's allocation. This means that each agent should value their own bundle of items at least as much as they value the other agent's bundle.

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent places on the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 26 + 95 + 45 + 63 + 42 = 271
- Agent 1's total valuation: 66 + 84 + 84 + 88 + 32 = 354

Now, we will allocate items to try and achieve envy-freeness. One approach is to maximize each agent's valuation of their own bundle, while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value item for Agent 0: Item 1 (Value = 95)
   - Next highest: Item 3 (Value = 63)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item for Agent 1: Item 3 (Value = 88) [Already allocated to Agent 0]
   - Next highest available: Item 2 (Value = 84)
   - Next highest available: Item 1 (Value = 84)
   - Next highest available: Item 0 (Value = 66)

Now, let's adjust to ensure all items are allocated:

- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0, as it is not yet allocated and Agent 0 could benefit from having another item.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 4:
  - Total value for Agent 0 = 95 + 42 = 137

- Agent 1 receives Items 0, 2, and 3:
  - Total value for Agent 1 = 66 + 84 + 88 = 238

This allocation respects the requirement of allocating all items and ensures that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations, given the constraints of integer allocations.

### Final JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
