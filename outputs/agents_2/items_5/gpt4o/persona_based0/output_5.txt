Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  33  22   1  39
1  45  36  11  11  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation, based on their individual valuations.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent values the items differently. For example, agent 0 values item 0 the most, while agent 1 values item 4 the most.
   - The total number of items is 5.

2. **Evaluating Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's valuations: [53, 33, 22, 1, 39]
   - Agent 1's valuations: [45, 36, 11, 11, 88]

3. **Allocating Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - **Agent 0:**
     - Highest value is for item 0 (value 53).
     - Next highest value is for item 1 (value 33).
   - **Agent 1:**
     - Highest value is for item 4 (value 88).
     - Next highest value is for item 0 (value 45) but item 0 is already allocated to agent 0, so we skip it.
     - Following this, item 1 has a value of 36 for agent 1, but item 1 is also allocated to agent 0.
     - The next highest value for agent 1 is item 3 (value 11).

4. **Balancing the Allocation:**
   - Currently, agent 0 has items 0 and 1, while agent 1 has item 4.
   - Remaining items are 2 and 3. To balance the allocation:
     - Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 22).
     - Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 11).

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 1, and 2.
   - Agent 1: Items 3 and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Agent 0 and agent 1 both receive items according to their preferences, minimizing envy.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
