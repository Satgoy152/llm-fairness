Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  52  18  89  92
1  36  39  69  20  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free division. This means that each agent should prefer their own allocation (or at least not strictly prefer someone else's allocation given their own valuations).

Let's analyze the valuations and find a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0's valuations:**  
  - Item 0: 17  
  - Item 1: 52  
  - Item 2: 18  
  - Item 3: 89  
  - Item 4: 92  

- **Agent 1's valuations:**  
  - Item 0: 36  
  - Item 1: 39  
  - Item 2: 69  
  - Item 3: 20  
  - Item 4: 17  

To achieve an envy-free and fair allocation, we can distribute the items as follows:

1. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 92, which is the highest valuation for any item.
   
2. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 1:**  
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 69, the highest among their valuations for unallocated items.

3. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 89, which is the next highest for unallocated items.

4. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1:**  
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 39, higher than item 0.

5. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 1:**  
   - Remaining item 0 goes to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a bundle that they highly value, minimizing envy.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
