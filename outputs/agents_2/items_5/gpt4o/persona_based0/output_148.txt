Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  93  64  66  75
1  71  56  44  85  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider how each agent values each item. The goal is to allocate items such that neither agent feels envious of the other, meaning each agent believes they have received at least as much value as the other agent from their perspective.

Here are the valuations provided:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 30     | 93     | 64     | 66     | 75     |
| 1     | 71     | 56     | 44     | 85     | 26     |

To find a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values Item 1 the highest (93), followed by Item 4 (75).
2. **Agent 1** values Item 3 the highest (85), followed by Item 0 (71).

Given these valuations, we can attempt to distribute the items as follows to balance the perceived total value for each agent:

- Allocate Item 1 and Item 4 to Agent 0. This gives Agent 0 a total value of 93 + 75 = 168.
- Allocate Item 0, Item 2, and Item 3 to Agent 1. This gives Agent 1 a total value of 71 + 44 + 85 = 200.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they highly value and keeps a reasonable balance in the total value each perceives they have received.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
