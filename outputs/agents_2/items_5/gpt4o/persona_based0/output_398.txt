Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  51  35  57  70
1  63  14  66  55  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that minimizes envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives, taking into account their valuations for each item. This is akin to solving a fair division problem where we aim for an envy-free allocation.

First, let's examine the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [95, 51, 35, 57, 70]
- Agent 1's valuations: [63, 14, 66, 55, 34]

Each agent should receive a set of items such that the total value they perceive is as balanced as possible with respect to their own valuations.

**Steps to Allocate:**

1. Calculate total valuations for each agent if they were to receive each item:
    - Agent 0 values: 
      - Item 0: 95
      - Item 1: 51
      - Item 2: 35
      - Item 3: 57
      - Item 4: 70
    - Agent 1 values:
      - Item 0: 63
      - Item 1: 14
      - Item 2: 66
      - Item 3: 55
      - Item 4: 34

2. Begin by allocating items to the agent with the higher valuation of that item, ensuring a balance over all items.

3. Use a strategy to minimize envy, such as the "Greedy" algorithm, which iteratively assigns each item to the agent whose relative value for that item is higher unless it creates significant imbalance.

**Greedy Allocation:**

- Item 0 (95 vs 63): Assign to Agent 0
- Item 1 (51 vs 14): Assign to Agent 0
- Item 2 (35 vs 66): Assign to Agent 1
- Item 3 (57 vs 55): Assign to Agent 0 (Agent 0 slightly prefers it)
- Item 4 (70 vs 34): Assign to Agent 0 (Agent 0 strongly prefers it)

However, this allocation gives more items to Agent 0 and none to Agent 1, so we need to adjust:

**Adjusted Allocation:**

Considering the total and relative values, let's try a balanced approach:

- Assign Item 0 and Item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign Items 1, 2, and 3 to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the resulting allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 4], total value = 95 + 70 = 165
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 2, 3], total value = 14 + 66 + 55 = 135

This allocation ensures both agents receive items and maintains a relatively balanced total perceived value without exceeding the item limit.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, each agent gets a fair share, and the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.
