Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   7  24  17  73   7
1  62  57   7   3  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the two agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and is as equitable as possible given the valuation matrix.

The valuations for the items by each agent are as follows:

- Agent 0's valuations: 7, 24, 17, 73, 7
- Agent 1's valuations: 62, 57, 7, 3, 89

Let's attempt to allocate the items by considering both the total value and individual preferences to minimize envy:

1. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 73 and Agent 1 at 3. It's clear that Agent 0 should get this item since they value it significantly higher.

2. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 89 and Agent 0 at 7. Assign this item to Agent 1 as they value it significantly higher.

3. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 62 and Agent 0 at 7. Assign this item to Agent 1 since they value it more.

4. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 57 and Agent 0 at 24. Assign this item to Agent 1 since they value it more.

5. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 17 and Agent 1 at 7. Assign this item to Agent 0 as they value it more.

With this allocation, we ensure that each agent receives items they value more highly, reducing envy. The total allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 4, 0, and 1.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [4, 0, 1]
}
```
