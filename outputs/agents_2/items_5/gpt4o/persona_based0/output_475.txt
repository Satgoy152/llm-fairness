Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  79  68  73  40
1  12  28  16  90  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy or ideally achieves envy-freeness. Hereâ€™s one way to think about it:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**:  
   - Item 0: 91  
   - Item 1: 79  
   - Item 2: 68  
   - Item 3: 73  
   - Item 4: 40  

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:  
   - Item 0: 12  
   - Item 1: 28  
   - Item 2: 16  
   - Item 3: 90  
   - Item 4: 62  

To minimize envy, we can analyze the marginal utility each item provides to each agent and try to allocate items in a way that balances total valuation.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 0, so it would be reasonable for them to receive it.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 3, so they should receive this item.
- **Agent 0** also has relatively high valuations for items 1 and 2 compared to Agent 1, so they should receive these items.
- **Agent 1** has a higher valuation for item 4 than Agent 0, so Agent 1 should receive this item.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 2  
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 4  

This allocation attempts to give each agent the items they value highly, aiming for an envy-free result.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
