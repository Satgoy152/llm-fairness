Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  50  23   5  94
1  60  58  92  49  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. This means each agent should feel that their share is at least as valuable as the share of the other agent.

Let's analyze the preferences:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 56
- Item 1: 50
- Item 2: 23
- Item 3: 5
- Item 4: 94

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 60
- Item 1: 58
- Item 2: 92
- Item 3: 49
- Item 4: 79

### Steps to Allocate:

1. **Identify highly valued items by agents:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most (94).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (92).

2. **Attempt to assign each agent their highest valued item:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items considering valuations:**
   - Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 0 (56).
   - Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 1 (58).

4. **Review remaining items and allocate:**
   - Item 3 is left. Agent 1 has a higher valuation of item 3 (49) compared to Agent 0 (5).

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items [0, 4].
   - Agent 1 gets items [1, 2, 3].

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they highly value. Agent 0 has items with a total valuation of 150 (56 + 94), and Agent 1 has items with a total valuation of 199 (58 + 92 + 49).

### Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
