Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  62   3  67  86
1  70   6  52  35  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we want to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [96, 62, 3, 67, 86]
- Agent 1: [70, 6, 52, 35, 25]

We will aim to maximize the perceived value for each agent while ensuring no envy exists between them.

**Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations.**

For each item, sum up the valuations from both agents:

- Item 0: 96 (Agent 0) + 70 (Agent 1) = 166
- Item 1: 62 (Agent 0) + 6 (Agent 1) = 68
- Item 2: 3 (Agent 0) + 52 (Agent 1) = 55
- Item 3: 67 (Agent 0) + 35 (Agent 1) = 102
- Item 4: 86 (Agent 0) + 25 (Agent 1) = 111

**Step 2: Sort Items by Valuation Difference.**

Consider the difference in valuations for each item:

- Item 0: 96 (A0) - 70 (A1) = 26
- Item 1: 62 (A0) - 6 (A1) = 56
- Item 2: 3 (A0) - 52 (A1) = -49
- Item 3: 67 (A0) - 35 (A1) = 32
- Item 4: 86 (A0) - 25 (A1) = 61

Based on the above, each agent should receive the items where they have a higher relative value.

**Step 3: Allocate Items to Minimize Envy.**

We allocate items to each agent by prioritizing their higher perceived value:

- Agent 0: Item 0, Item 1, Item 4 (highest positive differences)
- Agent 1: Item 2, Item 3 (negative difference or minimal positive difference)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences, thereby minimizing envy.

**Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items according to their highest relative valuations, aiming for an envy-free distribution.
