Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  66  81  12  12
1  57  84  55  93  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as the allocation of the other agent. Given the valuations, we can approach this problem by maximizing each agent's minimum value in their allocation.

Here's a breakdown of the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 12
  - Item 1: 66
  - Item 2: 81
  - Item 3: 12
  - Item 4: 12

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 57
  - Item 1: 84
  - Item 2: 55
  - Item 3: 93
  - Item 4: 27

We will attempt to allocate the items such that the allocations are as fair as possible:

1. Agent 1 values Item 3 the highest at 93, so it makes sense to start by allocating Item 3 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest at 81, so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 1 values Item 1 the second highest at 84, so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 0 values Item 0 at 12 and Agent 1 values it at 57; to balance, we allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
5. Finally, for Item 4, Agent 0 values it at 12, and Agent 1 values it at 27. To maintain a fair distribution, we allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations and keeps envy to a minimum.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
