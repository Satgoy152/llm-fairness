Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  31  60  20  51
1  59  18  85  91  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations to ensure that both agents feel they are receiving a fair share. One approach to achieve fairness is to aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as valuable as what the other agent received.

Here's the breakdown of each agent's valuation of the items:

- Agent 0: [50, 31, 60, 20, 51]
- Agent 1: [59, 18, 85, 91, 75]

Let's consider a possible fair allocation:

1. **Allocate items based on highest individual valuations:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (60).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (91).

2. **Attempt to balance the total valuation for each agent:**
   - After assigning item 2 to Agent 0 and item 3 to Agent 1, consider each remaining item's value to each agent.

3. **Complete the allocation while ensuring no agent envies the other's allocation:**
   - Assign item 0 (value 50 to Agent 0 and 59 to Agent 1) to Agent 1, as it gives Agent 1 a higher valuation.
   - Assign item 4 (value 51 to Agent 0 and 75 to Agent 1) to Agent 1, as it gives Agent 1 a higher valuation and helps balance overall values.
   - Assign item 1 (value 31 to Agent 0 and 18 to Agent 1) to Agent 0, as it suits Agent 0 better after the prior allocations.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 1] with valuations (60 + 31) = 91
- Agent 1: Items [3, 0, 4] with valuations (91 + 59 + 75) = 225

This allocation minimizes envy as much as possible given the constraints and ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their own valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 0, 4]
}
```
