Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  71  52  77  78
1  16   7  30   7  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of any other agent according to their own valuation.

First, let's list the valuations for clarity:

- Agent 0: [64, 71, 52, 77, 78]
- Agent 1: [16, 7, 30, 7, 44]

The total valuation for each agent if they received all the items is:

- Agent 0: 64 + 71 + 52 + 77 + 78 = 342
- Agent 1: 16 + 7 + 30 + 7 + 44 = 104

Given these valuations, Agent 0 values the items significantly more than Agent 1. We need to allocate the items to try and balance these valuations.

Let's consider a possible allocation:

1. Assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 0, as they are the most valuable to them (77 and 78).
2. Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 1, as they are the most valuable to them (16 and 30).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.

This results in:
- Agent 0 receives items 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation would give:

- Agent 0: 71 + 77 + 78 = 226
- Agent 1: 16 + 30 = 46

This allocation minimizes envy as much as possible given the constraints, as Agent 0 receives high-value items according to their valuations, and Agent 1 receives the highest possible value items according to theirs.

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
