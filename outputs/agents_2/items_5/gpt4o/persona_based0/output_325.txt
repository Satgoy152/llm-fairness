Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  46  30  11  48
1   4  52  74  36  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation, while ensuring that no agent envies the allocation of another.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [68, 46, 30, 11, 48]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [4, 52, 74, 36, 98]

Let's perform a fair division:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued item is item 0 (value 68)
   - Second highest is item 1 (value 46)
   - Third highest is item 4 (value 48)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item is item 4 (value 98)
   - Second highest is item 2 (value 74)
   - Third highest is item 1 (value 52)

To ensure a fair allocation, consider the following approach:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (high value for Agent 0, low for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (high value for Agent 1, moderate for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (high value for Agent 1, low for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (moderate value for both agents).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (moderate value for Agent 1, low for Agent 0).

Upon this allocation, Agent 0 will receive items 0 and 1, and Agent 1 will receive items 2, 3, and 4. This aims to balance the valuations and minimize envy.

Now, let's present the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
