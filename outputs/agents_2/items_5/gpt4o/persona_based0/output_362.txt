Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1  2   3   4
0  36  18  0  24  37
1  31  88  4   3  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free division. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve such an allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: 36 (Item 0) + 18 (Item 1) + 0 (Item 2) + 24 (Item 3) + 37 (Item 4) = 115
   - Agent 1: 31 (Item 0) + 88 (Item 1) + 4 (Item 2) + 3 (Item 3) + 22 (Item 4) = 148

2. **Identify High-Value Items**:
   - Based on the valuations, Agent 0 values Items 0 and 4 the most.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 significantly more than any other items.

3. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Assign high-value items to each agent to minimize envy:
     - Agent 0 gets Item 0 and Item 4.
     - Agent 1 gets Item 1.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Remaining items are Item 2 and Item 3.
   - Agent 0 has no value for Item 2, so it's reasonable to assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 1 has a very low valuation for it.

5. **Final Allocation and Check**:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 2

Ensure that each agent feels they have a fair share based on their valuations:

- Agent 0's allocation: 36 (Item 0) + 24 (Item 3) + 37 (Item 4) = 97
- Agent 1's allocation: 88 (Item 1) + 4 (Item 2) = 92

This allocation is envy-free as neither agent prefers the other's allocation over their own, based on their valuation.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
