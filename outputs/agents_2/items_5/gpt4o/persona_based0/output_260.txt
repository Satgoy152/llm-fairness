Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  27  60  41  48
1  29  47  22   6  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness can be challenging with integer allocations, but we will attempt to balance the total valuations each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value for all items: 88 + 27 + 60 + 41 + 48 = 264
- Agent 1's total value for all items: 29 + 47 + 22 + 6 + 58 = 162

We aim for an allocation where the sum of the values received by each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's consider allocations:

1. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0**: This item has high value for Agent 0 (88) and low value for Agent 1 (29).

2. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 1**: This item has higher value for Agent 1 (58) compared to Agent 0 (48).

3. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1**: This item also provides more value to Agent 1 (47) than Agent 0 (27).

4. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: This item has higher value for Agent 0 (60) compared to Agent 1 (22).

5. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 0**: This item is more valuable to Agent 0 (41) than Agent 1 (6).

With this allocation:

- **Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 3**.
- **Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4**.

Calculating the total values each agent receives:

- Agent 0's total value: 88 (item 0) + 60 (item 2) + 41 (item 3) = 189
- Agent 1's total value: 47 (item 1) + 58 (item 4) = 105

This allocation aims to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they value more compared to the other agent. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
