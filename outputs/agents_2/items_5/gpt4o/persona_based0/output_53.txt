Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  65  26  10  81
1  36  44  44  64  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can consider each agent's valuation of the items. We'll attempt to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [50, 65, 26, 10, 81]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [36, 44, 44, 64, 60]

First, let's calculate the total value each agent perceives for all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 50 + 65 + 26 + 10 + 81 = 232
- Total value for Agent 1: 36 + 44 + 44 + 64 + 60 = 248

To aim for fairness, we'll attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives approximately half of their perceived total value.

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0's Perspective:**
   - Half of Agent 0's total value is 232 / 2 = 116.
   - Agent 0 highly values items 4, 1, and 0.

2. **Agent 1's Perspective:**
   - Half of Agent 1's total value is 248 / 2 = 124.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 3, 2, and 4.

Now, let's determine a fair allocation:

- **Allocate item 4 to Agent 0**: (Value for Agent 0 = 81, for Agent 1 = 60)
  - Remaining values for Agent 0: [50, 65, 26, 10], Total value allocated = 81
  - Remaining values for Agent 1: [36, 44, 44, 64], Total value allocated = 60

- **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1**: (Value for Agent 0 = 10, for Agent 1 = 64)
  - Remaining values for Agent 0: [50, 65, 26], Total value allocated = 81
  - Remaining values for Agent 1: [36, 44, 44], Total value allocated = 124

- **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0**: (Value for Agent 0 = 65, for Agent 1 = 44)
  - Remaining values for Agent 0: [50, 26], Total value allocated = 146
  - Remaining values for Agent 1: [36, 44], Total value allocated = 124

- **Allocate item 0 to Agent 1**: (Value for Agent 0 = 50, for Agent 1 = 36)
  - Remaining values for Agent 0: [26], Total value allocated = 146
  - Remaining values for Agent 1: [44], Total value allocated = 160

- **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: (Value for Agent 0 = 26, for Agent 1 = 44)
  - Final allocation for Agent 0: [4, 1, 2], Value = 146 + 26 = 172
  - Final allocation for Agent 1: [3, 0], Value = 160

### Final Allocations

Agent 0 receives items [4, 1, 2] and Agent 1 receives items [3, 0]. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the perceived values and minimize envy by giving each agent a fair share relative to their valuations.
