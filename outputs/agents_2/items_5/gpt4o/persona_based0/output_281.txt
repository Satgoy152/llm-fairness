Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  99  55   7   6
1  49  36  87  13  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free, we'll analyze the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to assign the items so that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's first look at the matrix of valuations:

- Agent 0: [94, 99, 55, 7, 6]
- Agent 1: [49, 36, 87, 13, 10]

Now, let's try to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values items 0 and 1 highly at 94 and 99, respectively.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 87.

A potential envy-free allocation could be:

- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0 because they value those items the highest.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because they value it the most.
- Distribute the remaining items 3 and 4. Given the low valuations and in order to balance the allocation, we can assign them to Agent 1.

This allocation can be verified by checking if any agent envies the other:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1 with a total value of 94 + 99 = 193.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 3, and 4 with a total value of 87 + 13 + 10 = 110.

Agent 0 has no incentive to take Agent 1's bundle, and Agent 1 values item 2 the most, which they have received. Thus, this allocation can be considered envy-free.

The final allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
