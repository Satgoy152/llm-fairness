Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  28  64  33  44
1  14  81  49   6  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the agents in a manner that attempts to minimize envy, we can consider each agent's valuation for the items and aim for an allocation where both agents feel they have received a fair share based on their valuations. However, since there are only two agents and five items, it may not be possible to achieve complete envy-freeness, but we can strive to get as close as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [94, 28, 64, 33, 44]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [14, 81, 49, 6, 48]

One approach to finding a fair division is to allocate items such that each agent receives a similar total valuation, if possible. Here's a suggested allocation:

1. Find the highest value items for each agent and ensure that they are fairly distributed.
2. Balance the remaining items to try to equalize the total valuation for each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 0 (94), so we will allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 1 (81), so we will allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

Now, we have 3 items left: 2, 3, and 4.

- Agent 0 next highly values item 2 (64), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 next highly values item 4 (48), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- The remaining item is 3, which Agent 0 values at 33 and Agent 1 values at 6. We allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it has higher value to them.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 4

The allocations result in the following total valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 94 (item 0) + 64 (item 2) + 33 (item 3) = 191
- Agent 1's total valuation: 81 (item 1) + 48 (item 4) = 129

While this allocation is not perfectly envy-free, it attempts to align the allocations with the agents' preferences given the constraint of integer allocations. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
