Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  47  74  12  74
1  44  18  20  84  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent values their allocated bundle at least as much as the other agentâ€™s bundle. We will start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items and then attempt to allocate items to balance perceived value.

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 0: 91, Item 1: 47, Item 2: 74, Item 3: 12, Item 4: 74
  - Total Value: 91 + 47 + 74 + 12 + 74 = 298

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 44, Item 1: 18, Item 2: 20, Item 3: 84, Item 4: 83
  - Total Value: 44 + 18 + 20 + 84 + 83 = 249

### Allocation Strategy:
We aim to allocate items such that the total perceived value is as balanced as possible between the two agents, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and no item is split between agents.

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for items 0, 2, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for items 3 and 4.

### Initial Allocation:
- **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values this highly (91) compared to Agent 1 (44).
- **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0**:
  - Agent 0 values this more (47) than Agent 1 (18).
- **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**:
  - Agent 0 values this more (74) than Agent 1 (20).
- **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1**:
  - Agent 1 values this highly (84) compared to Agent 0 (12).
- **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1**:
  - This item is valued similarly by both (Agent 0: 74, Agent 1: 83), but it complements Agent 1's bundle better.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 4

### Value Calculation:
- **Agent 0's Total Value**: 91 + 47 + 74 = 212
- **Agent 1's Total Value**: 84 + 83 = 167

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items, and while not perfectly balanced, it avoids extreme envy since each agent values their allocation significantly.

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
