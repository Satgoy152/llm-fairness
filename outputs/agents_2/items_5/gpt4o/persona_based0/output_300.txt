Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  26  68  69  51
1  35  94  90  46  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that neither feels envious of the other's allocation. 

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [68, 26, 68, 69, 51]
- Agent 1's valuations: [35, 94, 90, 46, 91]

We will try to allocate items in a way that each agent feels they are getting a fair share based on their valuations:

1. Agent 0 values items 0 and 3 significantly high, both at 68 and 69, respectively.
2. Agent 1 values items 1, 2, and 4 significantly high at 94, 90, and 91, respectively.

Given these valuations, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign items 0 and 3 to Agent 0, as they provide high value to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 2, and 4 to Agent 1, as they provide high value to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items they value highly, and neither is envious of the other's allocation as each feels they have received a fair value.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
