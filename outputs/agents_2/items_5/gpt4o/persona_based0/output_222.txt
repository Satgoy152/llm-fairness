Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  22  76  64  19
1  46  67   1  10  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[22 22 76 64 19]
 [46 67  1 10 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1), we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or at least minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as that of the other agent based on their own valuations.

Here's the valuation table:

```
          Items
         0   1   2   3   4
Agent 0: 22  22  76  64  19
Agent 1: 46  67   1  10  86
```

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 2 (76) and item 3 (64).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (67) and item 4 (86).

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - A good starting point is to allocate items based on high valuations to balance perceived value and minimize envy.
   - We aim to give each agent the items that they value highly and try to balance the total value each agent receives.

3. **Step-by-step Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 0, which is valued more by Agent 1 than Agent 0, but to balance, we allocate to Agent 0 (to maintain a balance in the number of items).

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [0, 2, 3]
   - Agent 1: [1, 4]

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the values received by both agents while ensuring that all items are allocated.
