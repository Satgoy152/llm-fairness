Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  96  12  24  50
1  35  91   6  55  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to consider the agents' valuations to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, based on their own valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 85 (item 0), 96 (item 1), 12 (item 2), 24 (item 3), 50 (item 4).
- Agent 1 values items as follows: 35 (item 0), 91 (item 1), 6 (item 2), 55 (item 3), 84 (item 4).

To find a fair allocation, we can use a method that approximates envy-freeness by maximizing each agent's total value of the items they receive.

One possible allocation strategy is to start by assigning the items that are most valued by each agent:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it most (96).
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it highly (84), and it's also the second-highest for Agent 0 (50), which minimizes potential envy.

Now let's allocate the remaining items:

3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it's highly valued (85) and less valued by Agent 1 (35).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it's highly valued (55) and less valued by Agent 0 (24).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it more (12) than Agent 1 (6).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4.

This allocation attempts to achieve a balance where each agent receives items they value highly, reducing potential envy.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
