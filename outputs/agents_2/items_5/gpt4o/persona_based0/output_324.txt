Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  76  56  44  77
1  52  96  73  12  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52 96 73 12 79]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim for an envy-free division. Each agent should feel that they have received a fair share given their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 86 + 76 + 56 + 44 + 77 = 339
- Agent 1's total valuation: 52 + 96 + 73 + 12 + 79 = 312

Given these valuations, we will try to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly and the allocation is as balanced as possible:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 0 (86), so we assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 1 (96), so we assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 1** has the next highest value for item 2 (73), so we assign item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** has the next highest value for item 4 (77), so we assign item 4 to Agent 0.
5. Finally, item 3 is left. Agent 0 values it at 44, while Agent 1 values it at 12, so we assign item 3 to Agent 0.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
