Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  89   8  92  88
1  24  47  22  87  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that considers envy-freeness, we will allocate the items in such a way that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocation of the other agent. The goal is to minimize envy between agents.

Let's analyze the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0 at 82
  - Item 1 at 89
  - Item 2 at 8
  - Item 3 at 92
  - Item 4 at 88

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 24
  - Item 1 at 47
  - Item 2 at 22
  - Item 3 at 87
  - Item 4 at 53

We aim to allocate these items such that both agents are satisfied with their own allocations and do not envy the allocation of the other agent.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 3**: This item has the highest value for both agents, but agent 0 values it slightly higher. Allocating this to agent 0 makes sense as it maximizes their valuation.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this more than agent 1. Allocating this to agent 0 also maximizes their valuation.

3. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values this item more than agent 1. Allocating item 4 to agent 0 seems optimal.

4. **Item 0**: Agent 0 has a significantly higher valuation for this item compared to agent 1. Allocating this to agent 0 maximizes their valuation.

5. **Item 2**: This is valued higher by agent 1 than agent 0. Therefore, assigning item 2 to agent 1 is optimal.

### Resulting Allocation:

- Assign items [0, 1, 3, 4] to agent 0.
- Assign item [2] to agent 1.

This allocation strategy gives agent 0 a total value of 351 (82+89+92+88) and agent 1 a value of 22. While agent 1 receives fewer items, this strategy ensures agent 0 is not envious of agent 1's allocation.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2]
}
```
