Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  35  29  11  76
1  38  23  48  52  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible, given only integer allocations. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: For each item, check which agent values it more and prioritize assigning it to that agent, while balancing the overall distribution.

2. **Greedy Allocation Strategy**: Assign items to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: If one agent ends up with a significantly higher total valuation, consider redistributing items to balance the total valuation between the agents.

Let's calculate the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 at 38. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 at 23. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 29, Agent 1 at 48. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 11, Agent 1 at 52. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 90. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the total valuation for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0: 86 (Item 0) + 35 (Item 1) = 121
- Agent 1: 48 (Item 2) + 52 (Item 3) + 90 (Item 4) = 190

This allocation favors Agent 1 in terms of total valuation. To ensure a fairer distribution, we can try to redistribute:

- Swap Item 0 and Item 4 (as Agent 0 values Item 4 significantly).

Revised Allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0, Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 1, Item 2, Item 3

Revised Total Valuation:

- Agent 0: 86 (Item 0) + 76 (Item 4) = 162
- Agent 1: 35 (Item 1) + 48 (Item 2) + 52 (Item 3) = 135

This allocation is more balanced. Now, present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
