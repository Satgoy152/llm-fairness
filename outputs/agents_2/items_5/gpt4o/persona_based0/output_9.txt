Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  42  56  72  86
1  11  29  45  31  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each gets an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while trying to maintain envy-freeness as much as possible. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the Total Valuations for Each Item by Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 valuations: [21, 42, 56, 72, 86]
   - Agent 1 valuations: [11, 29, 45, 31, 61]

2. **Identify the Preferences for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items more highly in general compared to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0's highest valued items: 4 (86), 3 (72), 2 (56)
   - Agent 1's highest valued items: 4 (61), 2 (45), 3 (31)

3. **Allocate Items Starting with the Highest Valuations:**
   - Since Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (86), allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Next, allocate item 3 to Agent 0 as it is the second-highest valued (72) by them.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 as it is the highest valued (45) by them and has already been given two items to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 as it is more valuable to them than to Agent 1.
   - Finally, allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as both agents have received 2 items, and this balances the allocation.

4. **Ensure All Items are Allocated and List the Results:**
   - Agent 0: Items 4, 3, 1
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 0

This allocation ensures a fair division with each agent receiving a number of items proportional to their preferences, trying to minimize envy.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3, 1],
    "1": [2, 0]
}
```
