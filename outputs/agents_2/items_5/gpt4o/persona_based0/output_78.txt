Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  71  85  28   0
1  52  83   6  49  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives the allocation to be fair based on their valuations. The goal is to make sure that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation, meaning each agent should value their allocation at least as much as they value the other agent's allocation.

Let's first consider the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 31, 71, 85, 28, 0. Total valuation = 31 + 71 + 85 + 28 + 0 = 215.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: 52, 83, 6, 49, 26. Total valuation = 52 + 83 + 6 + 49 + 26 = 216.

Since the total valuations are almost equal, we can aim for each agent to receive items with approximately half of the total value.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (value 85)
   - Second highest valued item: Item 1 (value 71)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (value 83)
   - Second highest valued item: Item 0 (value 52)

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Give Item 2 (value 85) and Item 0 (value 31) 
  - Total value = 31 + 85 = 116

- **Agent 1**: Give Item 1 (value 83), Item 3 (value 49), and Item 4 (value 26)
  - Total value = 83 + 49 + 26 = 158

### Verification:

- Agent 0's total value from their allocation: 116
- Agent 1's total value from their allocation: 158

While this isn't perfectly envy-free given the distribution of items, it is a practical approach given the constraints. Agent 0 receives items with a higher total value according to their own valuation, and Agent 1 receives a higher total value according to their valuation.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a reasonable share based on their own valuations.
