Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0  1   2   3   4
0   4  3  73  57  65
1  12  6  93  89  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to analyze their valuations for the items:

- Agent 0's valuations: [4, 3, 73, 57, 65]
- Agent 1's valuations: [12, 6, 93, 89, 75]

A common approach to achieve a fair division is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their perceived value while reducing envy.

Let's consider the total valuations for each item:

- Item 0: (4, 12)
- Item 1: (3, 6)
- Item 2: (73, 93)
- Item 3: (57, 89)
- Item 4: (65, 75)

To minimize envy, we can allocate items in such a way that each agent receives items they value highly compared to the other agent's valuation. Here is a proposed allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 2 significantly higher (93 vs. 73).
2. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 3 higher (89 vs. 57).
3. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 4 lower, but the remaining items are more valuable to Agent 1.
4. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1's valuation is higher (12 vs. 4).
5. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: Remaining item, less valued by both.

This allocation seems to balance the valuations and reduce potential envy:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 2, 3

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
