Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  94  77  81  70
1  62  71  42  16  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we should consider envy-freeness, meaning each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation based on their valuations. The sum of the values assigned to each agent should be as balanced as possible.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [95, 94, 77, 81, 70]
- Agent 1's valuations: [62, 71, 42, 16, 61]

One way to approach this is to compare each agent's relative value for each item and allocate items to maximize each agentâ€™s total perceived value.

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Valuation is 95
   - Item 1: Valuation is 94
   - Item 3: Valuation is 81

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 2: Valuation is 42
   - Item 4: Valuation is 61

### Justification:

- **Agent 0** receives items [0, 1, 3] with total valuations 95 + 94 + 81 = 270.
- **Agent 1** receives items [2, 4] with total valuations 42 + 61 = 103.

This allocation prioritizes giving Agent 0 the highest possible values, while ensuring Agent 1 receives items that together maximize their value based on their preferences. Although the value balance is skewed, it aims to minimize envy by giving high-valued items to Agent 0, who values them significantly more than Agent 1.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that:
- All 5 items are allocated.
- Each agent receives an integer number of items.
- The allocation is as fair as possible given the valuations.
