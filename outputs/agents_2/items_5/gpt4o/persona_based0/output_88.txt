Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  52  46  76  75
1  16  59  70  58  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering the envy-freeness criterion, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that neither agent prefers the other's allocation over their own.

Considering the given valuations for each item:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [62, 52, 46, 76, 75].
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [16, 59, 70, 58, 76].

A useful approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives for their allocation while ensuring no envy. Here is one possible fair allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0. Agent 0 values it at 76, which is the highest among all items for Agent 0.
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 1. Agent 1 values it at 76, which is the highest for Agent 1.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0. Agent 0 has a high valuation of 62 for this item, which is the second highest for them.
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 1. Agent 1 values it at 70, which is the second highest valuation for them.
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 0. Agent 0 values it at 52, which is the next highest for them.

Thus, the allocations can be represented as:

- Agent 0 receives items 3, 0, and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 4 and 2.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 1],
    "1": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation balances the preferences and ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, making it envy-free.
