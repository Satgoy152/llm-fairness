Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21   7  43  53   7
1   1  73  98  70  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we need to consider the notion of envy-freeness, where neither agent should prefer the allocation of the other over their own, given their valuations.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve a fair allocation:

1. **List Valuations**:
   - Agent 0 values: [21, 7, 43, 53, 7]
   - Agent 1 values: [1, 73, 98, 70, 49]

2. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**:
   - Total value for Agent 0: 21 + 7 + 43 + 53 + 7 = 131
   - Total value for Agent 1: 1 + 73 + 98 + 70 + 49 = 291

3. **Determine Allocation**:
   - We aim to allocate items such that each agent receives a similar proportion of their total valuation.
   - Items should be distributed to minimize envy.

4. **Allocate Items**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values it the most (98) compared to Agent 0 (43).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values it highly (70) and Agent 0 also has a high valuation (53).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 due to high valuation (73), although it causes slight envy, it is needed for balancing.
   - Assign item 0 and item 4 to Agent 0 to balance the distribution of remaining values.

This allocation minimizes envy because each agent receives the items they value higher relative to the other agent's valuation. 

5. **Final Allocation in JSON Format**:
   
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0 and 4, and Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, and 3. This allocation satisfies the criteria of distributing all items while aiming to minimize envy.
