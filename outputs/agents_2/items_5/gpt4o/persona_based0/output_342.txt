Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  17  72  19  14
1  86  35  91  82  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a way that is fair and envy-free, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation, while ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation. This often involves considering the total valuations each agent has for different combinations of items.

Let's first summarize the values given:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 17
  - Item 2: 72
  - Item 3: 19
  - Item 4: 14

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 86
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 91
  - Item 3: 82
  - Item 4: 38

The strategy is to allocate items such that the total value each agent perceives is as balanced as possible.

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values Item 0 and Item 2.
   - Agent 1 highly values Item 2 and Item 3.

2. **Consider Possible Allocations:**
   - Agent 0 could be allocated Items 0 and 2, which maximizes their valuation to 150.
   - Agent 1 could then be allocated Items 1, 3, and 4, which provides them a total valuation of 155.

3. **Check for Envy:**
   - Agent 0 has items valued at 150, while Agent 1's allocation is valued at 135 from Agent 0's perspective. Agent 0 does not envy Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 has items valued at 155, while Agent 0's allocation is valued at 177 from Agent 1's perspective. Agent 1 does not envy Agent 0.

This allocation is fair and envy-free given the constraints and maximizes satisfaction for both agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
