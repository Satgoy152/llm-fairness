Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  34  99  14  23
1  99  65  46  95  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we need to distribute the items in such a way that neither agent values the other agent's allocation more than their own.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [31, 34, 99, 14, 23]
- Agent 1's valuations: [99, 65, 46, 95, 91]

We aim to allocate the items so that the perceived value for each agent is balanced. A potential approach is to maximize the minimum of each agent's share.

Starting with the highest valuations:

1. Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 0 (99) and moderately by Agent 1 (46). Assigning it to Agent 0 increases their utility significantly.

2. Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 1 (99). Assigning it to Agent 1 increases their utility significantly.

3. Comparing the remaining items, Items 1 and 4 have relatively high values for Agent 1 compared to Agent 0. Assigning them to Agent 1 will balance the allocation better.

4. Item 3 is valued more by Agent 1 than Agent 0. However, assigning it to Agent 0 can ensure they receive a fair share in terms of the number of items, as Agent 0 currently only has one item. This helps balance the allocation quantity-wise.

Following this analysis, the allocation can be:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 4.

Let's summarize the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the overall utility for both agents while ensuring that each has a fair share of the items.
