Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  17  27  94  79
1  49  49  75  60  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [49 49 75 60 23]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total value for each agent while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's start by considering the valuations and aim to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible:

**Agent 0's valuations:**
- Item 0: 22
- Item 1: 17
- Item 2: 27
- Item 3: 94
- Item 4: 79

**Agent 1's valuations:**
- Item 0: 49
- Item 1: 49
- Item 2: 75
- Item 3: 60
- Item 4: 23

### Allocation Strategy

1. **High-Value Items:**
   - Item 3 is valued highly by Agent 0 (94) and moderately by Agent 1 (60). Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Item 2 is valued highly by Agent 1 (75) and moderately by Agent 0 (27). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

2. **Moderate-Value Items:**
   - Item 4 is valued highly by Agent 0 (79) and moderately by Agent 1 (23). Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Item 0 is valued moderately by both agents (Agent 0 values it at 22 and Agent 1 at 49). Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 to balance the values.

3. **Remaining Item:**
   - Item 1 is valued at 17 by Agent 0 and 49 by Agent 1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as it has a higher value for Agent 1.

### Allocation:

After considering the valuations and aiming for fairness, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, and 2

### JSON Representation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their perceived value and minimizes envy.
