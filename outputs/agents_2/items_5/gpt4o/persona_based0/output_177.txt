Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  95  99  97  36
1   5  10  78  74  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or near envy-free allocation. This means each agent should feel they received a fair share based on their valuation.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the allocation process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: First, calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0: 76 + 95 + 99 + 97 + 36 = 403
   - Agent 1: 5 + 10 + 78 + 74 + 79 = 246

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Valuation**: Since Agent 0 has a much higher total valuation, it would be fair to allocate items to maximize each agent's individual perceived value. We will attempt to give each agent items that they value the most.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Agent 0 values items 2 (99) and 3 (97) the highest.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 (79) the highest.

4. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - After assigning the highest valued items, distribute the remaining items to balance the total value each agent receives.
   - Agent 0 can also take item 0 (76) and item 1 (95) as they are valued highly by Agent 0 compared to Agent 1's valuation.

5. **Final Check**:
   - Ensure each agent's allocation is satisfactory based on their valuations and that all items are allocated.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items with a total valuation of 76 + 95 + 99 + 97 = 367, and Agent 1 receives item 4 with a valuation of 79. This allocation maximizes each agent's total valuation based on their preferences.
