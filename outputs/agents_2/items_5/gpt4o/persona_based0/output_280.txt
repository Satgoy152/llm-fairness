Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81   1  84  79  85
1  45  87  19  76  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution or as close to it as possible. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 81
  - Item 1: 1
  - Item 2: 84
  - Item 3: 79
  - Item 4: 85

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 45
  - Item 1: 87
  - Item 2: 19
  - Item 3: 76
  - Item 4: 96

One approach to achieve fairness is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while minimizing envy. To do this, we can use a strategy where each agent gets items that they value highly, taking into account the overall distribution.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1, since it is highly valued by Agent 1 (96) and relatively less by Agent 0 (85).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as it is highly valued by Agent 1 (87) compared to Agent 0 (1).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, since it has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (84) and a low valuation for Agent 1 (19).
4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued by Agent 0 (81) and moderately by Agent 1 (45).
5. Finally, assign Item 3 to Agent 0, as it is moderately valued by both agents but slightly more by Agent 0 (79 vs. 76).

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free, but it tries to minimize envy by giving each agent items they highly value.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
