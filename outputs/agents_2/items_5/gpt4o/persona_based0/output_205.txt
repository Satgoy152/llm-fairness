Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  75   3  98  71
1  18  20  49  23  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate these items among the two agents, we aim to achieve a distribution where neither agent envies the other, given their valuations for the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their individual valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [93, 75, 3, 98, 71]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [18, 20, 49, 23, 26]

A possible envy-free allocation can be achieved by considering the highest value items for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items for Agent 0 are items 3 (value 98) and 0 (value 93).
   - Allocate items 3 and 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 2 (value 49).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Items 1 and 4 remain unallocated. Since Agent 1 values item 1 (value 20) and item 4 (value 26) more than Agent 0 values them, allocate these to Agent 1.

This results in a fair allocation where Agent 0 receives their two highest valued items, and Agent 1 receives their highest valued item plus the remaining items.

### Final Allocations:

{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
