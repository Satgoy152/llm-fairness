Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  98  32  78  95
1  50  24  15  65  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items based on the valuations provided, we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free to the extent possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [95, 98, 32, 78, 95]
- Agent 1's valuations: [50, 24, 15, 65, 46]

**Step 1: Identify the highest valued items for each agent.**

For Agent 0, the highest valued items are:
1. Item 1 (value 98)
2. Item 0 (value 95)
3. Item 4 (value 95)

For Agent 1, the highest valued items are:
1. Item 3 (value 65)
2. Item 0 (value 50)
3. Item 4 (value 46)

**Step 2: Fair allocation based on preference.**

- Start by assigning the highest valued item for each agent that does not create a conflict.
- If a conflict arises, try to balance the value to ensure fairness.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this the highest (98), and Agent 1 values it as 24, which is significantly less.
2. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this the highest (65), and Agent 0 values it as 78, which is less than their highest preference.
3. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0**: Although both agents value this highly, Agent 0 has a stronger preference for it (95 vs. 50 for Agent 1).
4. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values it at 46, and Agent 0 values it equally to item 0 (95), but given previous allocations, it balances the values better.
5. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**: This is Agent 0's least valued item (32), but Agent 1 values it even lower (15).

**Step 3: Calculate total value for each agent.**

- Agent 0 receives Items: 0, 1, 2
  - Total value: 95 + 98 + 32 = 225

- Agent 1 receives Items: 3, 4
  - Total value: 65 + 46 = 111

The allocation ensures that each agent receives items and attempts to minimize envy based on the given valuations. Agent 0 has a higher total value, but Agent 1 receives high-value items based on their preferences.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
