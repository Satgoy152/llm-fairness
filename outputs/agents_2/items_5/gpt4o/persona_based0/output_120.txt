Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  83  49  76  31
1  72  84  21  49  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 84 21 49 49]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of the other agent, based on their own valuations.

Here's the valuation matrix for the two agents:

- Agent 0: [8, 83, 49, 76, 31]
- Agent 1: [72, 84, 21, 49, 49]

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they receive all the items:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 8 + 83 + 49 + 76 + 31 = 247
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 72 + 84 + 21 + 49 + 49 = 275

Next, we aim to allocate the items such that both agents feel they have received a fair share. An approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least two items (as there are 5 items in total, one agent will get 3 items and the other 2 items).

Now, we will allocate based on who values the item more:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 72, Agent 0 values it at 8.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.
   
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 84, Agent 0 values it at 83.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (since 84 > 83).

3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 values it at 21.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.
   
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 values it at 49.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. Item 4: Both agents value it at 49. We need to ensure a fair distribution, and Agent 1 currently has fewer items.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

Resulting allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: [2, 3]
- Agent 1 gets items: [0, 1, 4]

Let's verify the envy-freeness:

- Agent 0's valuation of their allocation: 49 + 76 = 125
- Agent 1's valuation of their allocation: 72 + 84 + 49 = 205

Agent 0 values Agent 1's allocation at: 8 + 83 + 31 = 122, which is less than their own 125, so no envy.

Agent 1 values Agent 0's allocation at: 21 + 49 = 70, which is less than their own 205, so no envy.

The allocation seems fair and envy-free. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
