Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  66  59  80  26
1  91  61  39  16  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, meaning each agent should prefer their own allocation over the allocation of the other agent. In this scenario, we have the valuations for two agents (0 and 1) over five items (0 through 4).

Let's first outline the agents' valuations for the items:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 66
  - Item 2: 59
  - Item 3: 80
  - Item 4: 26

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 91
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 39
  - Item 3: 16
  - Item 4: 11

A reasonable approach is to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as equal as possible. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0, 1, and 3. However, item 3 is valued the highest by Agent 0, and it is valued relatively low by Agent 1, making it a good candidate for allocation to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0. Given that item 0 is most valuable to Agent 1, it should be allocated to them.
3. With item 3 going to Agent 0 and item 0 going to Agent 1, the remaining items (1, 2, 4) need to be divided between the two agents. We need to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's compute the total value each agent receives based on the allocation of these remaining items.

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, item 2 to Agent 1, and item 4 to Agent 1. This gives us:

  - **Agent 0 receives**: Items [3, 1]
    - Total value: 80 (item 3) + 66 (item 1) = 146

  - **Agent 1 receives**: Items [0, 2, 4]
    - Total value: 91 (item 0) + 39 (item 2) + 11 (item 4) = 141

This allocation is reasonably fair because both agents receive almost equal total value. 

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
