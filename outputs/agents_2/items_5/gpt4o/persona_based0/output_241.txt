Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  94  39  26  18
1  36  49  65  36  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents and ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item and try to find a distribution where neither agent envies the other. 

Let's start by examining the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0's valuations: [67, 94, 39, 26, 18]
- Agent 1's valuations: [36, 49, 65, 36, 82]

We can use a simple method to allocate items based on maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, which often leads to fairer distributions. However, we need to ensure that the allocation results in both agents receiving integer numbers of items.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Assign the most valued item for each agent first:**

   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 94.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 82.

2. **Allocate these items first:**

   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items in a way that balances the total value received by each agent:**

   - Remaining items: 0, 2, 3
   - Agent 0: Already has item 1 (value 94)
   - Agent 1: Already has item 4 (value 82)

4. **Allocate the next most valued items to balance:**

   - Agent 0's highest remaining valued item is item 0 (value 67).
   - Agent 1's highest remaining valued item is item 2 (value 65).

   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

5. **Allocate the last remaining item:**

   - The last item, item 3, should be allocated to balance the allocation.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

The final allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, and 4

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives and minimizes envy.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
