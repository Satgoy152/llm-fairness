Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  67  20  68  85
1  60  49  59  69  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while attempting to achieve envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as the other agent's allocation.

Here is the valuation table for clarity:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 73      | 60      |
| 1    | 67      | 49      |
| 2    | 20      | 59      |
| 3    | 68      | 69      |
| 4    | 85      | 98      |

One potential approach is to allocate the items by maximizing each agent's total valuation of their assigned items while minimizing envy. Here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: Valuation 73
  - Item 1: Valuation 67
  - Item 2: Valuation 20

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 3: Valuation 69
  - Item 4: Valuation 98

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 73 + 67 + 20 = 160 and Agent 1 a total valuation of 69 + 98 = 167.

Both agents end up with high total valuations, and this allocation fairly distributes the total value while minimizing potential envy, given that both agents receive a mix of high and moderately valued items according to their own preferences.

Now, I will present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
