Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  59  88   3  61
1   9  87  82  58  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free to the extent possible, given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- **Agent 0's total valuation**: 60 + 59 + 88 + 3 + 61 = 271
- **Agent 1's total valuation**: 9 + 87 + 82 + 58 + 92 = 328

Next, we calculate the proportion each agent has of the total valuation:

- Total valuation for all items = 271 + 328 = 599

- **Agent 0's proportion**: 271 / 599 ≈ 0.452
- **Agent 1's proportion**: 328 / 599 ≈ 0.548

Based on these proportions, we aim to allocate approximately:

- **Agent 0**: 0.452 * 5 ≈ 2.26 items (rounded to 2 items)
- **Agent 1**: 0.548 * 5 ≈ 2.74 items (rounded to 3 items)

Now, we will allocate the items to maximize fairness and minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most at 88 and item 0 at 60. Assign items 2 and 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** will receive the remaining items: 1, 3, and 4.

Let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0's allocation**: Items 2 and 0
  - Valuation: 88 + 60 = 148

- **Agent 1's allocation**: Items 1, 3, and 4
  - Valuation: 87 + 58 + 92 = 237

This allocation ensures each agent receives items roughly proportional to their valuation shares.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
