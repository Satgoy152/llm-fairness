Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  88  72  12  84
1  79  51  78  27  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that neither agent would prefer to have the items allocated to the other agent, considering their valuations.

Here is the approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Possible Allocation:**
   - Compute the total value each agent assigns to each possible allocation of items.

2. **Maximize Each Agent's Satisfaction:**
   - Distribute the items to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent does not envy the other's allocation.

3. **Ensure All Items are Allocated:**
   - Ensure that all 5 items are allocated to the agents.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 92     | 88     | 72     | 12     | 84     |
| 1     | 79     | 51     | 78     | 27     | 18     |

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has a relatively high valuation for item 2, compared to others.

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can assign:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, and 4 (Total Valuation = 92 + 88 + 84 = 264)
- **Agent 1**: Items 2 and 3 (Total Valuation = 78 + 27 = 105)

Both agents receive some of the items with their highest valuations, and neither agent envies the other's allocation based on their individual valuation scales.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
