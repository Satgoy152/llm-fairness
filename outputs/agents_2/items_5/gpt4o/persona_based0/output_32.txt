Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  58  65  16   5
1  54  40  99  43  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [85, 58, 65, 16, 5]
- Agent 1's valuations: [54, 40, 99, 43, 47]

One way to approach this problem is by maximizing the total value for each agent, ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation too much. 

Let's explore the possibilities:

1. **Maximize Agent 0's total value:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 85.
   - Next, Agent 0 values items 2 and 1 at 65 and 58, respectively.

2. **Maximize Agent 1's total value:**
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 99.
   - Next, Agent 1 values item 4 at 47.

To balance the allocations and achieve fairness, let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 1
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 3, and 4

By this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items with values [85, 58] for a total of 143.
- Agent 1 receives items with values [99, 43, 47] for a total of 189.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a substantial value of items, and while Agent 1's total value is higher, Agent 0 receives items with their highest individual value.

Now, I'll provide the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
