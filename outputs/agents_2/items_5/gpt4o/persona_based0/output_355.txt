Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  67  63  70  57
1   4   2  48  69  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for a strategy that minimizes envy and tries to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. The table of valuations is as follows:

```
Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4
-----------------------------------
Agent 0    | 81 | 67 | 63 | 70 | 57
Agent 1    |  4 |  2 | 48 | 69 | 11
```

One approach is to allocate items by maximizing the sum of the valuations each agent receives, which can help achieve fairness. Here's the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 0 (81) and item 1 (67). 
   - Allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation for item 3 (69).
   - Allocate this item to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 2 and 4 are left.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 63 and item 4 at 57, while Agent 1 values them at 48 and 11, respectively.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 as well because Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3]
}
``` 

This allocation maximizes the sum of valuations for Agent 0 while ensuring that Agent 1 receives their highest-valued item, which can help mitigate potential envy.
