Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  51  25  91  51
1  97  62  24  66  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the Envy-Free criterion as a guide. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items received by the other agent over their own bundle.

Let's first list the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [81, 51, 25, 91, 51]
- Agent 1: [97, 62, 24, 66, 65]

To find an envy-free allocation, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they receive all items. This helps to understand their overall preferences.
2. Try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items with a higher total valuation and no envy is generated.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Give item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it higher (97 vs. 81).
- Give item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it higher (91 vs. 66).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as they slightly value it higher (62 vs. 51).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it higher (25 vs. 24).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as they value it slightly higher (65 vs. 51).

This distribution results in:

- Agent 0 gets items [2, 3].
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 1, 4].

This allocation is envy-free because each agent receives items that they individually value highly and do not prefer the other agent's bundle over their own.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
