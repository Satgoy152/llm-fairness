Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  81  56  10  56
1  60  15  57  11  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [60 15 57 11 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation based on their valuation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [65, 81, 56, 10, 56]
- Agent 1's valuations: [60, 15, 57, 11, 12]

A straightforward approach to achieve fairness is to maximize the total value each agent receives.

**Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item**
- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 65, Agent 1 values at 60.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 81, Agent 1 values at 15.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 56, Agent 1 values at 57.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 10, Agent 1 values at 11.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 56, Agent 1 values at 12.

**Step 2: Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**
- Assign each item to the agent who values it more, ensuring each agent gets items such that the total number of items is allocated.

**Allocation:**
- Item 0: Agent 0 (65 > 60)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (81 > 15)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (57 > 56)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (11 > 10)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (56 > 12)

**Resulting Allocation:**
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, thereby minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
