Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86   6  76  67  35
1  14  71  20  81  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means each agent should feel satisfied with their allocation compared to the other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's first observe the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 86 (item 0) + 6 (item 1) + 76 (item 2) + 67 (item 3) + 35 (item 4) = 270
- Agent 1: 14 (item 0) + 71 (item 1) + 20 (item 2) + 81 (item 3) + 43 (item 4) = 229

Next, we will try to ensure that each agent receives items where their valuations are significantly higher compared to the other agent's valuation of the same items.

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 86, whereas Agent 1 values it at 14. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 71, whereas Agent 0 values it at 6. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 76, whereas Agent 1 values it at 20. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 81, whereas Agent 0 values it at 67. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 43, whereas Agent 0 values it at 35. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their higher valuations. Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a proportional amount of value based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.
