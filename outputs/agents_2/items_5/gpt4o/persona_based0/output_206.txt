Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  91  54  70  37
1  75  81  85  28  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their allocation.

Let's first examine the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 64 + 91 + 54 + 70 + 37 = 316
- Agent 1 total valuation: 75 + 81 + 85 + 28 + 54 = 323

Next, let's consider different allocations and ensure that each agent is as satisfied as possible given the constraint that each must receive an integer number of items. We will aim for an allocation where neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's try to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, ensuring the allocation is envy-free:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for her (91).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for him (85).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as he values it next highest (75).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as she values it next highest (70).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as he values it (54).

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3] with total valuation of 91 + 70 = 161
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 4] with total valuation of 75 + 85 + 54 = 214

This allocation provides a reasonable balance between the agents, given that Agent 1 has a slightly higher total valuation across all items than Agent 0. This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their total value without envying the other.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation maintains fairness and ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items.
