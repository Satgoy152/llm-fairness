Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  58  46  88  55
1  82  31  57  32  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of items they value highly. One potential method is to use the "Envy-Free" allocation, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 27 + 58 + 46 + 88 + 55 = 274
- Agent 1's total valuation: 82 + 31 + 57 + 32 + 97 = 299

Now, let's look at a potential allocation that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items:**
   - Item 3: Value 88
   - Item 1: Value 58
   - Item 4: Value 55

2. **Agent 1's highest valued items:**
   - Item 4: Value 97
   - Item 0: Value 82
   - Item 2: Value 57

To ensure fairness and integer allocations, let's allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0:** Receives items 3 and 1
  - Total Valuation = 88 (Item 3) + 58 (Item 1) = 146

- **Agent 1:** Receives items 4, 0, and 2
  - Total Valuation = 97 (Item 4) + 82 (Item 0) + 57 (Item 2) = 236

This allocation attempts to balance the agents' perceived values. Agent 0 receives items that they value highly, and Agent 1 receives the remaining items which sum to a higher total value, reflecting their overall higher valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4, 0, 2]
}
```
