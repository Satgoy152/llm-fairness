Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  50  14  96  48
1  58  90  36  87  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation or at least minimize envy given the constraints. Here, we want to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that the allocation is as fair as possible.

First, let's calculate the total valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [82, 50, 14, 96, 48]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [58, 90, 36, 87, 89]

We can use the method of maximizing each agent's valuation of the items they receive. Let's attempt a fair distribution considering the highest value items for each agent that do not cause significant envy.

1. **Assign Item 3:** 
   - Agent 0 values this at 96.
   - Agent 1 values this at 87.
   - Assign to Agent 0, as they value it the highest.

2. **Assign Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values this at 50.
   - Agent 1 values this at 90.
   - Assign to Agent 1, as they value it the highest.

3. **Assign Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values this at 48.
   - Agent 1 values this at 89.
   - Assign to Agent 1, as they value it the highest.

4. **Assign Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values this at 82.
   - Agent 1 values this at 58.
   - Assign to Agent 0, as they value it the highest.

5. **Assign Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values this at 14.
   - Agent 1 values this at 36.
   - Assign to Agent 1, as they value it the highest.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1, 4, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction given their valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated.
