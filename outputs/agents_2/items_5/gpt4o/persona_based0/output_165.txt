Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  14  58  18  30
1   7  11   1   3  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. 

First, let's summarize the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 22 + 14 + 58 + 18 + 30 = 142
- Agent 1's total valuation: 7 + 11 + 1 + 3 + 47 = 69

Next, we try to allocate the items such that envy is minimized. We look at each item's valuation across both agents and attempt to allocate them in a way that maximizes each agent's perceived fairness.

Let's analyze the valuation of each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 22, Agent 1 values at 7
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 14, Agent 1 values at 11
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 58, Agent 1 values at 1
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 18, Agent 1 values at 3
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 30, Agent 1 values at 47

A potential allocation could be:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, because Agent 0 values it the most.
2. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1, because Agent 1 values it highly compared to Agent 0.
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it significantly more than Agent 1.
4. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as the valuations are relatively close, but it helps balance the allocation.
5. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, to help balance the total number of items.

This allocation attempts to balance the overall value perceived by each agent, considering their valuations.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
