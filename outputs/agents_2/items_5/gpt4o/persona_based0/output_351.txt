Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  37  27  88  22  50
1  66  77  74  92   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item and aim to allocate the items in a way that minimizes any sense of unfairness.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [37, 27, 88, 22, 50]
- Agent 1: [66, 77, 74, 92, 2]

The goal is to allocate all 5 items between the two agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is as fair as possible.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 37 + 27 + 88 + 22 + 50 = 224
- Total value for Agent 1: 66 + 77 + 74 + 92 + 2 = 311

We aim to allocate items to each agent such that their total perceived value is roughly balanced and each agent feels their share is fair according to their valuations.

After examining the valuations, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign items [0, 1, 4] to Agent 1:
  - Total value for Agent 1: 66 (item 0) + 77 (item 1) + 2 (item 4) = 145

- Assign items [2, 3] to Agent 0:
  - Total value for Agent 0: 88 (item 2) + 22 (item 3) = 110

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value for both agents while ensuring each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences. Although Agent 1 receives three items, the total value perceived by each agent is closer in this distribution, which helps achieve fairness.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
