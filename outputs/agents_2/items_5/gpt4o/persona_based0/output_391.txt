Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75   5  87  18  37
1   4  21  10  51  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the valuations.

Firstly, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 5
  - Item 2: 87
  - Item 3: 18
  - Item 4: 37

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 4
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 10
  - Item 3: 51
  - Item 4: 53

Given these valuations, let's consider how to allocate the items to minimize envy:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item significantly higher (75 vs. 4), so it makes sense to allocate this item to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item higher (21 vs. 5), so it makes sense to allocate this to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item the highest (87 vs. 10), so this should go to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this item significantly higher (51 vs. 18), so it should be allocated to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this item higher (53 vs. 37), so it should be allocated to Agent 1.

The proposed allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value more than the other agent, thereby minimizing envy.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
