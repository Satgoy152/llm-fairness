Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47   5  65  36  74
1  88  10   6  96  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 10  6 96 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, I'll aim for envy-freeness, meaning each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what the other agent received, according to their own valuations.

Let's interpret the given table:

- Agent 0's valuations: [47, 5, 65, 36, 74]
- Agent 1's valuations: [88, 10, 6, 96, 31]

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent's perceived "value" of their allocation is maximized to the extent possible, given the constraints.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 47.
   - Agent 1 values it at 88.
   - Allocation: Assign to Agent 1, as they value it more.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 5.
   - Agent 1 values it at 10.
   - Allocation: Assign to Agent 1, as they value it more.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 65.
   - Agent 1 values it at 6.
   - Allocation: Assign to Agent 0, as they value it more.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 36.
   - Agent 1 values it at 96.
   - Allocation: Assign to Agent 1, as they value it more.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 74.
   - Agent 1 values it at 31.
   - Allocation: Assign to Agent 0, as they value it more.

### Allocation Summary:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 3.

This allocation is designed to optimize the total perceived value for each agent according to their individual valuations, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
