Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  15  30  93  36
1  96  94  79  91   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which means that no agent prefers the allocation of items given to another agent over their own allocation. We aim to provide an allocation where each agent values their bundle at least as much as the other agent values it.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [56, 15, 30, 93, 36]
- Agent 1's valuations: [96, 94, 79, 91, 2]

The total value for each agent (sum of all item values):
- Agent 0: 230
- Agent 1: 362

To achieve a fair allocation, we want each agent to receive a bundle of items such that the total valuation for each bundle is balanced relative to the agents' total valuations. 

One approach is to maximize fairness by ensuring that the relative value of the bundle to each agent is as equal as possible.

Let's attempt an allocation:

1. Start by giving Agent 1 the most valuable item according to their valuation, which is item 0 (value 96).

2. Next, give Agent 0 the item they value the most, which is item 3 (value 93).

3. Continue by assigning items to balance the valuations as closely as possible:
   - Give Agent 1 item 1 (value 94), because Agent 1 values it highly.
   - Give Agent 0 item 2 (value 30), which balances the allocations more evenly.
   - Finally, give Agent 0 item 4 (value 36) to ensure all items are allocated.

Now, verify the total valuation for each agent's allocated items:
- Agent 0 receives items 3, 2, and 4, with a total value of 159 (93 + 30 + 36).
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1, with a total value of 190 (96 + 94).

This allocation respects the envy-freeness condition, as neither agent would want to swap their bundle for the otherâ€™s based on their valuations.

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
