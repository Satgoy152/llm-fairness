Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  19  82  96  30
1  26  84  98  61  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free to the extent possible, given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items. This means that each agent should be at least as happy with their own allocation as with the allocation given to the other agent, based on their own valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [87, 19, 82, 96, 30]
- Agent 1's valuations: [26, 84, 98, 61, 87]

We'll approach the allocation using the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that neither agent envies the other's bundle if possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - Agent 0 places high value on items 3 (96) and 0 (87).
   - Agent 1 places high value on items 2 (98) and 1 (84).

2. **Assigning High-Value Items**:
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 96).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 98).

3. **Second Round Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 87).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 84).

4. **Remaining Item**:
   - The remaining item is item 4. Let's evaluate:
     - Agent 0's valuation for item 4 is 30.
     - Agent 1's valuation for item 4 is 87.

Based on these valuations, item 4 should be allocated to Agent 1 to maximize their overall satisfaction and maintain a balance in the total value perceived by each agent.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, and 4.

This allocation is as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints, as it ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their own valuations.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
