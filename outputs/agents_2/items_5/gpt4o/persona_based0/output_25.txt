Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  95  36  48  67
1  25  96  36  57  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to minimize potential envy by maximizing each agent's total value from their allocation. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the items allocated to another agent over their own allocation based on their valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [94, 95, 36, 48, 67]
- Agent 1: [25, 96, 36, 57, 75]

To create an envy-free allocation, we'll try to allocate items such that each agent's total value from their allocation is as high as possible given that each agent receives a fair share. 

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 95, and Agent 1 values it at 96.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 as they have the highest valuation.

2. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 94, and Agent 1 values it at 25.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 as they have the highest valuation.

3. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 67, and Agent 1 values it at 75.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 as they have the highest valuation.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 48, and Agent 1 values it at 57.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 as they have the highest valuation.

5. **Item 2:**
   - Both Agent 0 and Agent 1 value it at 36.
   - In cases of equal valuation, we can allocate to any agent as it doesn't affect envy-freeness. Allocate to Agent 0.

### Resulting Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, while Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, and 4. This configuration considers both agents' valuations and attempts to minimize potential envy, given that each agent's allocation provides them with a high total value based on their preferences.
