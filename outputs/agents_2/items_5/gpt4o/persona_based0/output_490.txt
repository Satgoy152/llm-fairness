Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1  2   3   4
0  27  48  6  73  12
1  12   3  7  43  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the valuations. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own.

Let's outline the steps for a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 27 + 48 + 6 + 73 + 12 = 166
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 12 + 3 + 7 + 43 + 96 = 161

2. **Identify High-Valuation Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highly (73).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 highly (96).

3. **Initial Allocation Based on High-Valuation Items:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Consider remaining items 0, 1, and 2.

5. **Check for Best Fit:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 27 for Agent 0 vs. 12 for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 48 for Agent 0 vs. 3 for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 6 for Agent 0 vs. 7 for Agent 1).

6. **Review Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 3, 0, and 1.
   - Agent 1 receives items 4 and 2.

7. **Check Envy-Freeness:**
   - Agent 0: Value of allocated items = 73 + 27 + 48 = 148.
   - Agent 1: Value of allocated items = 96 + 7 = 103.
   - While the allocation isn't perfectly envy-free (Agent 0's total value is higher), Agent 0 has the higher-valued items based on their preferences.

The allocations in json format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
