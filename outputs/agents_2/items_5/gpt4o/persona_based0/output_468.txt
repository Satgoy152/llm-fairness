Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  48  50  43  87
1  18  21  93  46  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we aim for a division where the allocation is envy-free or as close as possible, considering the agents' valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [53, 48, 50, 43, 87]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [18, 21, 93, 46, 68]

The total value each agent assigns to all items is:

- Total value for Agent 0: 53 + 48 + 50 + 43 + 87 = 281
- Total value for Agent 1: 18 + 21 + 93 + 46 + 68 = 246

A fair allocation would aim to balance the total value received by each agent according to their valuations.

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Allocate the highest valued item for each agent first:**
   - Agent 0's highest valued item is item 4 (87).
   - Agent 1's highest valued item is item 2 (93).

2. **Allocate remaining items to maximize perceived value and minimize envy:**
   - Agent 0: Already has item 4 (87). Next highest values are items 0 (53), 2 (50), 1 (48), 3 (43).
   - Agent 1: Already has item 2 (93). Next highest values are items 4 (68), 3 (46), 1 (21), 0 (18).

Considering these, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value: 53) for Agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value: 46) for Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value: 48) for Agent 0.

This gives us:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 4.
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fairly balanced total value based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
