Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  90  57  61  73
1  76  39  37   1  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value as highly as possible, while also striving to avoid envy (where one agent prefers the allocation of the other agent over their own). 

First, let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [46, 90, 57, 61, 73]
- Agent 1's valuations: [76, 39, 37, 1, 11]

To find a fair solution, we can use the method of maximizing the total value for each agent by considering their preferences. One approach is to start by giving each agent the item they value the most, and then continue assigning items to balance the remaining valuations while considering the overall fairness.

1. **Initial high-value allocations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (90).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (76).

2. **Remaining items after initial allocations:**
   - Remaining items: 2, 3, 4

3. **Balancing the remaining items:**
   - Agent 0's remaining highest values are for items 4 (73) and 3 (61).
   - Agent 1's remaining highest values are for items 2 (37).

4. **Allocating the remaining items:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest remaining value for them).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest remaining value for them).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest for Agent 0).

This allocation is designed to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their respective valuations and ensure that each agent receives at least one item of high value to them.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
