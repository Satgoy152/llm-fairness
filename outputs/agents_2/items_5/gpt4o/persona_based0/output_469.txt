Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  17   5   0  10
1  14  39  50  28  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent. The goal is to achieve an allocation where each agent feels they received a fair share, ideally without any envy. This can be challenging with integer allocations, but we can aim to minimize potential envy.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [90, 17, 5, 0, 10]
- Agent 1: [14, 39, 50, 28, 40]

### Strategy:
1. **Highest Valuation Priority**: Allocate items based on the highest difference in valuations between agents. This can help in reducing the potential for envy.
2. **Consider Total Valuation**: Ensure that both agents receive allocations that are as balanced as possible in terms of total valuation.

### Allocation Steps:
1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 90, whereas Agent 1 values it at 14.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 due to the significant preference difference.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 17, whereas Agent 1 values it at 39.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 due to the higher valuation.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 5, whereas Agent 1 values it at 50.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 due to the higher valuation.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 0, whereas Agent 1 values it at 28.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 due to the zero valuation by Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 10, whereas Agent 1 values it at 40.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 due to the higher valuation.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives Item 0.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1, 2, 3, and 4.

### JSON Format Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation respects the higher preferences of the agents for specific items and attempts to minimize potential envy by allocating the most valued items according to each agent's viewpoint.
