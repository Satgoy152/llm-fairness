Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  10  66  95  55
1  12  60  11   3  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy, if possible. Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [9, 10, 66, 95, 55]
- Agent 1: [12, 60, 11, 3, 73]

A common method for ensuring fairness is the Envy-Free allocation, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Another approach is the Max-Min Fairness, where each agent receives their most valued items to the extent possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation Items Per Agent**: 
    - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (95), followed by item 2 (66).
    - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (73), followed by item 1 (60).

2. **Assign the Most Valued Items**:
    - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
    - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Consider the Remaining Items**:
    - Remaining items: 0, 1, and 2.
    - Agent 0's valuations: 9 (item 0), 10 (item 1), 66 (item 2).
    - Agent 1's valuations: 12 (item 0), 60 (item 1), 11 (item 2).

4. **Assign Remaining Items to Minimize Envy**:
    - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (since it's highly valued by Agent 0 and less by Agent 1).
    - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (since it's highly valued by Agent 1).
    - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it slightly more than Agent 0).

By following this allocation, we attempt to minimize envy and ensure a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 4.

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
