Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  55  50  49  77
1  47  66  62  65   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation where neither agent envies the other. This means each agent should prefer or be equally satisfied with their own allocation over the other's.

Here are the steps to achieve a fair and envy-free allocation:

1. **Identify Preferences**: For each agent, determine which items they value the most.

   - Agent 0 values: 
     - Item 4 (77)
     - Item 0 (71)
     - Item 1 (55)
     - Item 2 (50)
     - Item 3 (49)

   - Agent 1 values: 
     - Item 1 (66)
     - Item 3 (65)
     - Item 2 (62)
     - Item 0 (47)
     - Item 4 (3)

2. **Allocate Items**: We will try to allocate items in such a way that both agents get a fair share based on their preferences.

   - Agent 0 gets the highest valued item for them, which is Item 4.
   - Agent 1 gets Item 1, as it is their highest preference.
   - Agent 0 gets Item 0, which is their second-highest preference.
   - Agent 1 gets Item 3, their second-highest preference.
   - The remaining item, Item 2, should be allocated to Agent 1, as it is their third-highest preference and is still valued relatively highly by Agent 0.

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness**: Ensure that neither agent prefers the other's allocation over their own.

   - Agent 0 has Items 4 and 0 with a total valuation of 77 + 71 = 148.
   - Agent 1 has Items 1, 3, and 2 with a total valuation of 66 + 65 + 62 = 193.

   While the total valuation for Agent 1 is higher, each agent received their top preferences, which should help in minimizing envy. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives their top-valued items, and the total number of items allocated is 5.
