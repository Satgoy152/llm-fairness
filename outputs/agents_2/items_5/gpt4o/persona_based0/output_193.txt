Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  39  48  44  81
1  60  64  21  53  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received at least as much value as the other agent according to their own valuations.

Let's look at the valuations given:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 1: 39
  - Item 2: 48
  - Item 3: 44
  - Item 4: 81

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 60
  - Item 1: 64
  - Item 2: 21
  - Item 3: 53
  - Item 4: 13

To find an envy-free allocation, we should consider the total value each agent assigns to each subset of items and ensure that both agents are satisfied with their allocation. 

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 98 + 39 + 48 + 44 + 81 = 310
- Total value for Agent 1: 60 + 64 + 21 + 53 + 13 = 211

Given the total values, we will try to allocate items in a way that balances the perceived value for each agent.

One possible allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 4]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 98 (Item 0) + 81 (Item 4) = 179

- Agent 1 receives items: [1, 2, 3]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 64 (Item 1) + 21 (Item 2) + 53 (Item 3) = 138

This allocation attempts to balance the values each agent receives based on their valuations. Although it is not perfectly envy-free because the total values for each agent differ, it attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent some of their higher-valued items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
