Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  70  57  47  45
1  95   7  16  21   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent believes they have received at least as much value as the other agent, given their own valuations. 

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations: [58, 70, 57, 47, 45]  
Agent 1's valuations: [95, 7, 16, 21, 8]

Total valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0: 58 + 70 + 57 + 47 + 45 = 277
- Agent 1: 95 + 7 + 16 + 21 + 8 = 147

To allocate items fairly, we can look at each agent's highest valuations and try to ensure that the allocation is as balanced as possible.

1. **Initial Allocation Based on High Valuations:**

   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (95), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (70), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Remaining Items:**

   Now, we have to allocate the remaining items [2, 3, 4] while trying to maintain fairness.

   - For item 2, Agent 0 values it at 57, while Agent 1 values it at 16. It would be fair to allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - For item 3, Agent 0 values it at 47 and Agent 1 values it at 21. It would be fair to allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - For item 4, Agent 0 values it at 45 and Agent 1 values it at 8. It would be fair to allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Final Allocation:**

Based on the above considerations, here is a fair allocation of items:

Agent 0's allocated items: [1, 2, 3]  
Agent 1's allocated items: [0, 4]

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value items across both agents while ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share given their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
