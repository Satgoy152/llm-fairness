Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44   9  37  19  89
1  58  67  57  95  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that minimizes envy, we can use the concept of maximizing individual utility while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: 44, 9, 37, 19, 89
- Agent 1's valuations: 58, 67, 57, 95, 46

A good strategy is to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly while ensuring that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

1. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values this item at 95, which is the highest single valuation across items for both agents.
2. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values this item at 89, which is the highest remaining valuation for Agent 0.
3. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values this item at 67, which is the next highest valuation.
4. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values this item at 58.
5. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values this item at 37.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value highly, and the total value each receives is fairly balanced. The total valuation for each agent is:

- Agent 0: 37 (item 2) + 89 (item 4) = 126
- Agent 1: 95 (item 3) + 67 (item 1) + 58 (item 0) = 220

While the total valuation is not equal, the allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent their highest-valued items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
