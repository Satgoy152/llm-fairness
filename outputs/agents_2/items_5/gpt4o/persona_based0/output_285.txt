Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25   4  19  32  25
1  35  55   2  37  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received their fair share based on their valuations. We can use a simple algorithm to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items combined.
2. Try to allocate items so that the perceived total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(25 + 4 + 19 + 32 + 25 = 105\)
- Agent 1: \(35 + 55 + 2 + 37 + 48 = 177\)

Next, let's try to allocate items such that the perceived value for each agent is balanced:

1. **Agent 0** values items 3 and 0 the highest (values 32 and 25 respectively).
2. **Agent 1** values items 1 and 4 the highest (values 55 and 48 respectively).

Let's start allocating:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 32).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 25).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 55).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 48).

After this allocation, we have one item left, which is item 2:

- Agent 0 values item 2 at 19.
- Agent 1 values item 2 at 2.

Since Agent 0 values item 2 more than Agent 1, we'll allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

After allocation:

- Agent 0 has items 0, 2, and 3 (values 25, 19, 32 respectively): Total value = 76
- Agent 1 has items 1 and 4 (values 55, 48 respectively): Total value = 103

This allocation is as balanced as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items, and the distribution is as fair as possible based on their valuations.
