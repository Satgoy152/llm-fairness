Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  97  63  52  65
1  39   7  45  86   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that each agent prefers their allocation to the allocation of the other agent, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [35, 97, 63, 52, 65]
- Agent 1's valuations: [39, 7, 45, 86, 9]

To achieve a fair allocation, let's allocate items by considering which items each agent values most compared to the other, potentially balancing the total value each receives.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item is 1 with a value of 97.
   - Next highest is item 4 with a value of 65.
   - Next is item 2 with a value of 63.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item is 3 with a value of 86.
   - Next highest is item 0 with a value of 39.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Items: [1, 4, 2]
  - Total valuation = 97 + 65 + 63 = 225

- **Agent 1**:
  - Items: [3, 0]
  - Total valuation = 86 + 39 = 125

This allocation is not exactly envy-free, as Agent 1 might envy Agent 0 for receiving a higher value in total. However, given the constraints, this allocation provides a logical distribution based on maximizing each agent's valuation with the selected items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 2],
    "1": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and all items are allocated.
