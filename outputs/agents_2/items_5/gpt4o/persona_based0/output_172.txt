Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47  54  54  19  91
1  82  21  25  48  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents in a way that minimizes envy, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. Here, we want to ensure that each agent feels they have received at least as much value from their allocation as they would from the other's allocation.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 47 + 54 + 54 + 19 + 91 = 265
- Agent 1: 82 + 21 + 25 + 48 + 90 = 266

We see that both agents have similar total valuations for all items. Therefore, we aim to distribute the items in a manner that approximates equal value for each.

To achieve this, let's try to allocate the items as follows:

1. Calculate the marginal value of each item to each agent, which is simply the value they assign to the item.
2. Strategically assign the items to balance total value received by each agent.

Let's consider the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 47, Agent 1 values at 82.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 54, Agent 1 values at 21.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 54, Agent 1 values at 25.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 19, Agent 1 values at 48.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 91, Agent 1 values at 90.

A possible fair allocation, considering the values, can be:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (higher value for 1).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (higher value for 0).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (higher value for 0).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (higher value for 1).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (slightly higher value for 0).

Now, let's check the total value received by each agent:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 2, 4]: Value = 54 + 54 + 91 = 199
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 3]: Value = 82 + 48 = 130

To balance the distribution better, let's re-evaluate:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

This results in:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 4]: Total value = 54 + 91 = 145
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 2, 3]: Total value = 82 + 25 + 48 = 155

This allocation appears to be more balanced in terms of total value.

Therefore, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
