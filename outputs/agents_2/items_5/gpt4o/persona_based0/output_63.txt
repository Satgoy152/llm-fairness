Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  12  62  70  12
1  74  51   3  14  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate items to agents while minimizing envy, let's consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We want to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuation.

Here is the breakdown of the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 30
  - Item 1: 12
  - Item 2: 62
  - Item 3: 70
  - Item 4: 12
- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 74
  - Item 1: 51
  - Item 2: 3
  - Item 3: 14
  - Item 4: 23

To minimize envy and ensure fairness, we can consider the following allocation:

1. Identify each agent's highest-valued items.
2. Assign items to agents, attempting to give each agent their most valued items while ensuring all items are allocated.

For Agent 0, the most valued items are 3 (70) and 2 (62). For Agent 1, the most valued items are 0 (74) and 1 (51).

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 1
- The remaining item, 4, has equal low valuation for Agent 0 and relatively low for Agent 1, but since Agent 1 still gets a higher overall value, we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

Thus, the final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
