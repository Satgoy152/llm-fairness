Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3  4
0  66  33  65  64  2
1  49  97  74  18  9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 97 74 18  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items based on the given valuations while ensuring envy-freeness, we first need to consider how each agent values each item. The goal is to allocate items such that each agent ends up with a bundle of items that they perceive as fair, given their valuations.

Here are the valuations provided:

- Agent 0: [66, 33, 65, 64, 2]
- Agent 1: [49, 97, 74, 18, 9]

We can use the following steps to achieve an envy-free allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: 
   - For Agent 0, the highest value items are 0, 2, and 3.
   - For Agent 1, the highest value items are 1 and 2.

2. **Check for Common High-Value Items**:
   - Item 2 is highly valued by both agents.

3. **Allocate Based on Valuation Priorities**:
   - Since Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (97), we can allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 because it has a slightly lower value for Agent 0 compared to Agent 1, ensuring that Agent 1's top priority is satisfied with item 1.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued by them and less so by Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 as well since it's the next highest for them.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as it has little impact on their overall evaluation compared to losing out on item 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one of their top-valued items, minimizing envy.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
