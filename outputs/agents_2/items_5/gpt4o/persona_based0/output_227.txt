Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  42  30  50  86
1  50  62  11  88  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 62 11 88 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free division. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that neither agent envies the other's allocation based on their valuations. Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0's valuations: [71, 42, 30, 50, 86]
Agent 1's valuations: [50, 62, 11, 88, 80]
```

We can follow a process where we aim to maximize each agent's total value while keeping the allocation envy-free. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 71, while agent 1 values it at 50. Since agent 0 values it more, allocate item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 42, while agent 1 values it at 62. Since agent 1 values it more, allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 30, while agent 1 values it at 11. Since agent 0 values it more, allocate item 2 to agent 0.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 50, while agent 1 values it at 88. Since agent 1 values it more, allocate item 3 to agent 1.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 86, while agent 1 values it at 80. Since agent 0 values it more, allocate item 4 to agent 0.

Thus, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value relatively more compared to the other agent, minimizing envy.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
