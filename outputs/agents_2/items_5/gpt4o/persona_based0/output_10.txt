Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

   0   1   2   3   4
0  7  45  60  96  50
1  2  87   9  22  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 7  
  - Item 1: 45  
  - Item 2: 60  
  - Item 3: 96  
  - Item 4: 50  

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 2  
  - Item 1: 87  
  - Item 2: 9  
  - Item 3: 22  
  - Item 4: 61  

We will try to allocate the items so that each agent is satisfied with their share, or at least not envious of the other agent's share. 

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Assign high-value items based on each agent's preference:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 3 and 4.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 4.

2. **Allocate items to balance perceived fairness:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).

3. **Allocate remaining items to optimize overall fairness:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (second-highest value for Agent 1).
   - Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 0 to balance the total perceived value.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4.

This allocation ensures both agents receive items they highly value, minimizing envy and aiming for a fair distribution based on their individual valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
