Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  18  25  65  44
1  19  30  31   1  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to distribute the items in such a way that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 62
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 25
  - Item 3: 65
  - Item 4: 44

- Agent 1 values: 
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 30
  - Item 2: 31
  - Item 3: 1
  - Item 4: 10

We aim for an allocation that maximizes the perceived value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 (62) and 3 (65). These two items provide Agent 0 with a total value of 127.

2. **Agent 1** should receive the remaining items, which are 1, 2, and 4. These items have the following valuations from Agent 1's perspective:
   - Item 1: 30
   - Item 2: 31
   - Item 4: 10
   This gives Agent 1 a total value of 71.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items without envying the other's allocation. Agent 0 gets the two highest valued items according to their valuation, and Agent 1 gets a higher total perceived value from their share than they would from any single item left to Agent 0.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
