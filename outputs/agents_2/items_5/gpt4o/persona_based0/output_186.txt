Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73   1  66  51  79
1  36  14  21  13  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for each item. One common approach to ensure envy-freeness in small problems like this is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while considering their preferences.

Let's evaluate the situation:

- Agent 0's valuations: [73, 1, 66, 51, 79]
- Agent 1's valuations: [36, 14, 21, 13, 86]

To achieve a fair division, we can follow a strategy to allocate items in a way that balances the total valuation for each agent.

1. **Allocate Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 79, and Agent 1 values it at 86. Assign to Agent 1 to maximize the higher value.

2. **Allocate Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 73, and Agent 1 values it at 36. Assign to Agent 0 to maximize the higher value.

3. **Allocate Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 66, and Agent 1 values it at 21. Assign to Agent 0 to maximize the higher value.

4. **Allocate Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 51, and Agent 1 values it at 13. Assign to Agent 0 to maximize the higher value.

5. **Allocate Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 1, and Agent 1 values it at 14. Assign to Agent 1 to maximize the higher value.

Now, we have allocated all items, balancing the total value each agent perceives from their allocated items as much as possible given the constraints.

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 1 receives items: [1, 4]

The allocations in json format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
