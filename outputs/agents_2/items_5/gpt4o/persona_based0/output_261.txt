Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  51  16  62   2
1  43  95  95  15  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should feel that, given their valuations, they are not worse off with their allocated items compared to what the other agent received.

Let's consider the valuations for each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: [58, 51, 16, 62, 2]
- Agent 1's valuations: [43, 95, 95, 15, 11]

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can use the following approach:

1. **Assign high-value items to the agent that values them most**: 
   - Item 0: Valued higher by Agent 0 (58 vs. 43), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Valued higher by Agent 1 (95 vs. 51), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Valued equally by Agent 1 (95 vs. 16), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Valued higher by Agent 0 (62 vs. 15), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Valued higher by Agent 0 (2 vs. 11), assign to Agent 1 for balance, since Agent 1 has higher valuations for Item 1 and Item 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value more highly, which helps in achieving an envy-free allocation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their higher valuations, maintaining fairness and minimizing envy.
