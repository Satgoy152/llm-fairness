Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47  97  24  35  74
1  30  56  61  67  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent perceives their allocation as fair. A common method in fair division is to maximize the minimum utility each agent receives or to ensure envy-freeness to the extent possible.

Let's evaluate the situation and allocate the items:

- Agent 0's valuations: [47, 97, 24, 35, 74]
- Agent 1's valuations: [30, 56, 61, 67, 92]

We should aim to allocate items such that the distribution is as envy-free as possible. One way to do this is to assign each item to the agent who values it more. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 47, and Agent 1 values it at 30. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 97, and Agent 1 values it at 56. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 24, and Agent 1 values it at 61. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 35, and Agent 1 values it at 67. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 74, and Agent 1 values it at 92. Allocate to Agent 1.

This allocation maximizes the total value each agent receives and attempts to balance the allocations based on preferences. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
