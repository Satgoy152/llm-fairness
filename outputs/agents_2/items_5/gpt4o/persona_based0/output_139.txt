Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64   0  99  44   5
1  91  61  60  79  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that neither agent prefers the allocation of the other agent over their own allocation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair and envy-free allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: First, calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items combined.

   - Agent 0's total valuation: \( 64 + 0 + 99 + 44 + 5 = 212 \)
   - Agent 1's total valuation: \( 91 + 61 + 60 + 79 + 22 = 313 \)

2. **Proportional Share**: Each agent should ideally receive items whose total valuation is proportional to their overall valuation. Since we have 5 items, each agent should get items adding up to at least half of their total valuation.

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**: Look at each agentâ€™s highest valued items and try to allocate those.

   - Agent 0's highest valued items: Item 2 (99), Item 0 (64)
   - Agent 1's highest valued items: Item 0 (91), Item 3 (79)

4. **Adjust Allocation to Ensure Fairness**: We need to adjust the allocation so that both agents feel they have received a fair share.

   - Agent 0 gets items 2 and 0. 
   - Agent 1 gets items 3 and 4. 
   - The remaining item 1, which both value moderately, can be allocated to Agent 1 to balance the allocation.

5. **Check for Envy-Freeness**: Ensure neither agent envies the other's allocation. 

   - Agent 0: Values allocated items at \( 64 + 99 = 163 \).
   - Agent 1: Values allocated items at \( 79 + 22 + 61 = 162 \).

Both agents feel they have received a fair allocation as their total valuations of the items are comparable.

**Final Allocation in JSON Format**:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of the items based on their valuations while maintaining envy-freeness.
