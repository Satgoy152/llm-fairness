Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  28  77  41  41
1  49  38  62  58  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 38 62 58 23]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations provided in the table:

- Agent 0: [23, 28, 77, 41, 41]
- Agent 1: [49, 38, 62, 58, 23]

Let's compute the total value for each possible allocation and select one that minimizes envy.

### Step-by-Step Allocation

1. **Initial consideration:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 2 (77) and item 3 (41).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0 (49) and item 3 (58).

2. **Allocate the highest valued items:**
   - Give item 2 to Agent 0 because it's their highest value.
   - Give item 3 to Agent 1 because it's their highest value.

3. **Allocate the remaining items:**
   - For item 4, Agent 0 values it at 41 and Agent 1 values it at 23. Giving it to Agent 0 would maximize their satisfaction.
   - For item 1, Agent 0 values it at 28 and Agent 1 at 38. Assign it to Agent 1 who values it more.
   - For item 0, Agent 0 values it at 23 and Agent 1 at 49. Assign it to Agent 1 who values it more.

### Final Allocation

After considering the valuations, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 3

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations for each agent, reducing envy.

{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
