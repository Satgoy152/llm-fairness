Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  28  56  62  30
1   0  76  35  79  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 76 35 79 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for a division that minimizes envy and maximizes each agent's total value from the items they receive. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [92, 28, 56, 62, 30]
- Agent 1 values: [0, 76, 35, 79, 36]

Let's calculate the total value each agent attributes to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 92 + 28 + 56 + 62 + 30 = 268
- Total value for Agent 1: 0 + 76 + 35 + 79 + 36 = 226

Now, let's consider a fair allocation strategy:

1. **Allocate the highest valued item from each agent's perspective first:**
   - Agent 0's highest valued item is 0 with a value of 92.
   - Agent 1's highest valued item is 3 with a value of 79.

2. **Continue assigning based on next highest preference:**
   - For Agent 0, the next highest value is item 3 (62), but it's already allocated to Agent 1, so we skip to the next one which is item 2 (56).
   - For Agent 1, the next highest value is item 1 (76), which is unallocated.

3. **Allocate remaining items considering the remaining preferences:**
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (30) is left after allocating the top preferences.
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (76) is already allocated, and item 2 (35) is allocated to Agent 0. The remaining item is 4 (36), which is already allocated to Agent 0. Hence, agent 1 will have item 1 as well.

After allocation, each agent should have an integer number of items, totaling 5 items in total:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 1]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items based on their preferences while keeping the allocation fair. The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 1]
}
```
