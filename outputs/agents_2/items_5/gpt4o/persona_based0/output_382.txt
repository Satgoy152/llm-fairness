Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  85  25  95  63
1  26  89  22  48  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [26 89 22 48 45]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value relatively equally or as close as possible, minimizing envy.

### Valuation Table:
- Agent 0 values: [12, 85, 25, 95, 63]
- Agent 1 values: [26, 89, 22, 48, 45]

### Total Valuations:
- Total value for Agent 0: 12 + 85 + 25 + 95 + 63 = 280
- Total value for Agent 1: 26 + 89 + 22 + 48 + 45 = 230

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Maximize Individual Satisfaction**: Allocate items to agents based on their highest relative valuation to ensure that the total value of items for each agent is as equal as possible.
2. **Check Envy-freeness**: Ensure that neither agent prefers the other's allocation over their own.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item highly at 95, while Agent 1 values it at 48. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Both agents value this item highly, but Agent 1's value (89) is slightly higher compared to Agent 0's (85). Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 0, because Agent 0 values it more (63 vs. 45).
- **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 1, although Agent 0 values it less (12 vs. 26).
- **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it more (25 vs. 22).

### Final Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: Items 3, 4, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 0

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fairly valued bundle based on their own valuations, minimizing envy.

### JSON Format Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 2],
    "1": [1, 0]
}
```
