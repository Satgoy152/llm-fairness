Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  37  77  32  81
1  71  75   7  99  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or minimizing envy. Here is a step-by-step approach to finding an allocation:

1. **List the Valuations:**

   - Agent 0: [36, 37, 77, 32, 81]
   - Agent 1: [71, 75, 7, 99, 77]

2. **Initial Observations:**

   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most at 81.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 99.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**

   - Assign items primarily based on each agent's highest valuation to minimize envy.
   - Ensure the total number of items allocated is 5, and each agent gets at least one item.

4. **Allocate Items:**

   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value item for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value item for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (second highest value and high utility for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (third highest value for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).

5. **Check Allocation for Fairness:**

   - Agent 0 receives items [4, 2].
   - Agent 1 receives items [3, 0, 1].

By this allocation, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 5.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
