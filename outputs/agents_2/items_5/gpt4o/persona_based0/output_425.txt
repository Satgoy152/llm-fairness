Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  41  57   1  30
1  80  81  26  94  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents under the principles of envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent. In this setup, we have two agents and five items. Our goal is to allocate the items such that neither agent feels envious of the otherâ€™s allocation.

First, let's consider the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 63 (Item 0) + 41 (Item 1) + 57 (Item 2) + 1 (Item 3) + 30 (Item 4) = 192
- Agent 1: 80 (Item 0) + 81 (Item 1) + 26 (Item 2) + 94 (Item 3) + 90 (Item 4) = 371

Now, based on these valuations, let's allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring fairness:

1. Agent 1 highly values Item 3 (94) and Item 1 (81), so it makes sense to allocate these to Agent 1 to maximize their satisfaction.
2. Agent 0 values Item 0 (63) and Item 2 (57) higher than other items, so these are allocated to Agent 0.
3. Finally, Item 4 (valued at 30 by Agent 0 and 90 by Agent 1) should be given to Agent 1 because it increases their total valuation significantly and keeps the allocation envy-free.

The final allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their own perceived value, and no agent feels envious of the other's allocation.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
