Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  70  81  13   5
1  93  55  77  50  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 55 77 50 22]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the two agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. An allocation is envy-free if each agent believes they received at least as much value as any other agent, based on their own valuation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [69, 70, 81, 13, 5]
- Agent 1 values: [93, 55, 77, 50, 22]

We will try to allocate items in such a way that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 2** - Agent 0 values it at 81, and Agent 1 values it at 77. Agent 0 values it slightly higher, so allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 0** - Agent 0 values it at 69, and Agent 1 values it at 93. Agent 1 values it significantly higher, so allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 1** - Agent 0 values it at 70, and Agent 1 values it at 55. Agent 0 values it higher, so allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3** - Agent 0 values it at 13, and Agent 1 values it at 50. Agent 1 values it significantly higher, so allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4** - Agent 0 values it at 5, and Agent 1 values it at 22. Agent 1 values it higher, so allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3, 4]

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences. Agent 0 receives items that they value the most, and Agent 1 receives the remaining items which they value more than Agent 0.

{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
