Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  12  53   5  44
1  79  97  24  73  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [79 97 24 73 70]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is both balanced and envy-free to the extent possible given the constraints. We'll consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item and attempt to allocate the items so that each agent feels they received a fair share of total value.

### Valuation Table
```
Agent \ Item |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
-------------------------------------------
Agent 0      | 61  | 12  | 53  |  5  | 44  |
Agent 1      | 79  | 97  | 24  | 73  | 70  |
```

### Total Valuation by Agent
- **Agent 0 Total Valuation:** 61 + 12 + 53 + 5 + 44 = 175
- **Agent 1 Total Valuation:** 79 + 97 + 24 + 73 + 70 = 343

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values this item the highest (97), and since this is the highest valuation for any item by either agent, it's reasonable to allocate it to Agent 1.
2. **Item 0:** Agent 1 also values this item highly (79), but Agent 0 values this item at 61, which is their highest valuation. This item can go to Agent 0.
3. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values this item highly (70), so it will go to Agent 1.
4. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values this item fairly high (53), so it can be allocated to Agent 0.
5. **Item 3:** Although the valuations are relatively low for both agents, Agent 1 values it at 73 and Agent 0 values it at 5. Allocating it to Agent 1 makes sense to balance the perceived fairness.

### Final Allocation
- **Agent 0** receives items 0 and 2.
- **Agent 1** receives items 1, 3, and 4.

This allocation aims to ensure each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their respective valuations.

### Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
