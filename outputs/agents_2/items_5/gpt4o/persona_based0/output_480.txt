Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  89   5  91  72
1  35  81  83  70  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to find an allocation where no agent feels envy towards the other, meaning each agent believes they received at least as much value as the other agent. Let's evaluate the total value each agent would receive under various allocations and select one that minimizes envy.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 40  
  - Item 1: 89  
  - Item 2: 5  
  - Item 3: 91  
  - Item 4: 72  

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 35  
  - Item 1: 81  
  - Item 2: 83  
  - Item 3: 70  
  - Item 4: 93  

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can aim for an allocation such that each agent gets an approximately equal total value according to their own valuation.

Let's explore an allocation:

- Assign items 0, 3, and 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 1.

Calculating the total value for each agent:

- Agent 0: 40 (item 0) + 91 (item 3) + 72 (item 4) = 203
- Agent 1: 81 (item 1) + 83 (item 2) = 164

This allocation provides a reasonable balance of total value between the agents, given their valuations, and minimizes the potential for envy. Agent 0 receives more according to their valuation, but given the constraints, this allocation is a reasonable attempt at fairness.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
