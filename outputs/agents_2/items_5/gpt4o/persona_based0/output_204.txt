Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  28  75   7  79
1  89  53  89  17   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value any other allocation. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [94, 28, 75, 7, 79]
- Agent 1's valuations: [89, 53, 89, 17, 5]

One approach to achieve a fair division is by using the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or similar heuristic methods, but given the small number of items and agents, we will use a simple direct allocation method to ensure each agent gets a number of items, and the allocation is as fair as possible.

Let's analyze and allocate:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 4 (94 and 79).
   - Agent 1 highly values items 0, 2, and 1 (89, 89, and 53).

2. **Begin with items that have distinct highest valuations:**
   - Item 0: Both agents value this highly, but Agent 0 values it slightly more. However, we need to balance the allocation.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values this more (53 vs. 28).
   - Item 2: Both agents value this highly, with equal valuation (75 vs. 89).

3. **Allocate items:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0. This is a high-value item for them.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1. This is a high-value item for them.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1. It creates a balance since Agent 1 values it equally to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0. This is a low-value item for both, but Agent 0 gets it to balance item allocation.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0. Agent 0 values this item highly.

This allocation gives Agent 0 the combination of items that they value more and balances the overall value each agent perceives from their allocation.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
