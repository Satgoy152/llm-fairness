Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  54  95  66  87
1  88   7   5  73  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we'll consider the valuations of each item by the agents. Envy-freeness ensures that each agent feels they received a fair share compared to what others received. This requires us to balance the perceived values each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 99 + 54 + 95 + 66 + 87 = 401
- Agent 1's total valuation: 88 + 7 + 5 + 73 + 15 = 188

Now, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent's total perceived value of their allocation is as equal as possible. 

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**
   - Value to Agent 0: 99
   - Value to Agent 1: 88
   - Assign to Agent 0 as they have a higher valuation.

2. **Item 1**
   - Value to Agent 0: 54
   - Value to Agent 1: 7
   - Assign to Agent 0 as they have a significantly higher valuation.

3. **Item 2**
   - Value to Agent 0: 95
   - Value to Agent 1: 5
   - Assign to Agent 0 as they have a significantly higher valuation.

4. **Item 3**
   - Value to Agent 0: 66
   - Value to Agent 1: 73
   - Assign to Agent 1 as they have a higher valuation.

5. **Item 4**
   - Value to Agent 0: 87
   - Value to Agent 1: 15
   - Assign to Agent 0 as they have a significantly higher valuation.

### Final Allocations:

Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Total value for Agent 0: 99 + 54 + 95 + 87 = 335

Agent 1 receives items: 3
- Total value for Agent 1: 73

While this allocation does not perfectly achieve equal perceived values, it respects the higher valuation assignments and ensures that Agent 1 receives the item they value the highest among those left.
