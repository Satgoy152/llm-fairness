Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  48  14  99  63
1  95  98  86  34   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1) while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We aim to allocate the items such that each agent's allocation maximizes their individual satisfaction given their valuations, while also minimizing envy between the agents.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [17, 48, 14, 99, 63]
- Agent 1's valuations: [95, 98, 86, 34, 4]

Strategically, we should look to assign items to agents where they have a significantly higher valuation compared to the other agent. This approach will help in achieving envy-freeness. 

1. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item at 99, while Agent 1 values it at 34. It's clear that Agent 0 should receive Item 3.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item at 98, while Agent 0 values it at 48. Agent 1 should receive Item 1.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values this at 86, while Agent 0 values it at 14. Agent 1 should receive Item 2.

4. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this at 95, while Agent 0 values it at 17. Agent 1 should receive Item 0.

5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values this at 63, while Agent 1 values it at 4. Agent 0 should receive Item 4.

Now, let's ensure the allocations are fair and envy-free:

- Agent 0 receives Items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0, 1, and 2.

Agent 0's total valuation is 162 (99 + 63), and Agent 1's total valuation is 279 (95 + 98 + 86). This allocation minimizes envy as each agent receives items they highly value.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
