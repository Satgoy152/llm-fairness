Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  57  86  48  17
1  59  45  17  67  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, it's important to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize the satisfaction of each agent with their allocation. The goal is to distribute the items such that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation.

Let's consider the valuation table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 77     | 57     | 86     | 48     | 17     |
| 1     | 59     | 45     | 17     | 67     | 98     |

One common approach is to assign items based on the highest valuations, ensuring that no agent feels envious. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this item the most at 98, so allocate it to Agent 1.
2. **Item 2**: Agent 0 has a high valuation of 86 for this item, which is the highest for this agent, so allocate it to Agent 0.
3. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item at 77, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 59, so allocate it to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this item at 67, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 48, so allocate it to Agent 1.
5. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this item at 57, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 45, so allocate it to Agent 0.

Based on this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
