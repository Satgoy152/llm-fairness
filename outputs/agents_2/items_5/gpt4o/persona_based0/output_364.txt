Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  57   5  14  15
1  13  18  89  96  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own.

Let's examine the valuations of both agents:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 66
- Item 1: 57
- Item 2: 5
- Item 3: 14
- Item 4: 15

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 13
- Item 1: 18
- Item 2: 89
- Item 3: 96
- Item 4: 55

A potential approach is to assign items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while minimizing envy. 

1. **Agent 1's Strong Preferences:**
   - Item 3: 96
   - Item 2: 89
   These items have the highest value for Agent 1, so they should be prioritized for them.

2. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Item 0: 66
   - Item 1: 57
   These items have the highest value for Agent 0, so they should be prioritized for them.

3. **Distribute Remaining Item:**
   - Item 4 remains, with valuations: 
     - Agent 0: 15
     - Agent 1: 55
   It would be more beneficial to assign Item 4 to Agent 1, as it holds more value for them.

With these considerations, the allocation can be made as follows:
- Assign Items 0, 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Items 2, 3, 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation should maximize the total perceived value for each agent and attempt to minimize envy.

The allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
