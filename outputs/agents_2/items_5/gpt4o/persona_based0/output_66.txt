Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  56  12  85  76
1  11  71  97  33  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure each agent perceives their share as fair. The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0's valuations: [51, 56, 12, 85, 76]
- Agent 1's valuations: [11, 71, 97, 33, 99]

Given these valuations, let's analyze a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0** prefers item 3 the most (value 85), followed by item 4 (value 76).
2. **Agent 1** prefers item 2 the most (value 97), followed by item 4 (value 99).

To achieve a fair division, we aim to balance the total perceived value so that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's attempt the following allocation strategy:

- Assign Agent 0 items: 0, 3
- Assign Agent 1 items: 1, 2, 4

Let's calculate the total value each agent receives:

- **Agent 0**: Value of items [0, 3] = 51 + 85 = 136
- **Agent 1**: Value of items [1, 2, 4] = 71 + 97 + 99 = 267

This allocation attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent. Although Agent 1 receives a higher total value, Agent 0 receives their most valued item, item 3, which may help mitigate envy.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
