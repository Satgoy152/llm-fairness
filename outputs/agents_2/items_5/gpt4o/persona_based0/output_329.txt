Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  90  68  92  21
1  19  65  35  10  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Given that there are two agents, we need to ensure both receive some benefit in terms of their valuations.

Let's first consider the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [58, 90, 68, 92, 21]
- Agent 1's valuations: [19, 65, 35, 10, 87]

We will attempt to allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation while maintaining a fair distribution.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most at 92. 
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most at 87.

2. **Initial High-Value Item Allocation:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining Items Allocation:**
   - For Agent 0, the next highest remaining valued item is item 1 with a value of 90.
   - For Agent 1, the next highest remaining valued item is item 1, but since item 1 is already optimal for Agent 0, we continue to the next one for Agent 1.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - For Agent 1, item 2 is valued at 35, and item 0 is valued at 19.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0, since it has a higher value for Agent 0 than for Agent 1.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Final Adjustment:**
   - After these allocations, Agent 0 has items 0, 1, 3, and Agent 1 has items 2, 4.
   - This ensures that each agent gets items that are relatively more valuable to them compared to the other agent.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation should maximize the valuation for each agent given the constraint of integer-only allocation and the goal of minimizing envy.
