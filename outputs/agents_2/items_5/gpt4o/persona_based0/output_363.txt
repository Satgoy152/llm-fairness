Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  52  49  84  61
1  86  59  94  18  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents while considering their valuations (and aiming for envy-freeness as much as possible), we need to balance the total value each agent receives. Let's analyze the valuations from the table:

- Agent 0's valuations: [22, 52, 49, 84, 61]
- Agent 1's valuations: [86, 59, 94, 18, 20]

To ensure a fair distribution, we can perform the allocation by considering the highest value each agent places on the items and ensuring no agent envies another's allocation too much. 

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Item 3** has a high value of 84 for Agent 0. Given it's significant, allocate it to Agent 0.
2. **Item 2** is most valuable for Agent 1 (94), so allocate it to Agent 1.
3. **Item 0** has a higher value for Agent 1 than for Agent 0, so allocate it to Agent 1.
4. **Item 1** is relatively balanced, but Agent 0 values it more (52 vs. 59 for Agent 1). Allocate it to Agent 1 to balance overall value.
5. **Item 4** is more valuable to Agent 0 than Agent 1, so allocate it to Agent 0.

Let's summarize these allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3 and 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 1, and 2

Now, we format the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they value highly while keeping a balance in the total value received by each agent.
