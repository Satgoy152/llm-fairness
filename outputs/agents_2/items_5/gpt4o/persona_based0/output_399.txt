Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  53  77  38  19
1   0  61   8   9  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1) while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free if possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [50, 53, 77, 38, 19]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [0, 61, 8, 9, 76]

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 77.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 76.

2. **Allocate High-Value Items:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Review Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are 0, 1, and 3.

4. **Consider Remaining Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's remaining high values are for items 0 (50) and 1 (53).
   - Agent 1's remaining high value is for item 1 (61).

5. **Allocate Based on Remaining Valuations:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as it is valued higher by Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it is valued fairly high by Agent 0.

6. **Allocate the Last Item:**
   - The remaining item is 3. Agent 0 values it at 38, and Agent 1 values it at 9. 
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 4]

This allocation ensures a fair distribution considering the agents' valuations.

### JSON Format Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
