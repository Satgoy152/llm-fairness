Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  90  63   3  67
1  15  66  69  85  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy arises when an agent values another agent's bundle more than their own. A simple approach to achieve a fair division is to use the concept of envy-freeness where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [31, 90, 63, 3, 67]
- Agent 1: [15, 66, 69, 85, 60]

We can proceed by assigning items to maximize each agent's total valuation for their assigned items, while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 1 (90), 4 (67)
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 3 (85), 2 (69), 0 (15)

### Allocation Justification:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 4], with a total valuation of \(90 + 67 = 157\).
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 2, 0], with a total valuation of \(85 + 69 + 15 = 169\).

This allocation ensures that both agents receive high-value items according to their preferences. The allocation is balanced and reduces the potential for envy, as each agent receives items they highly value.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 2, 0]
}
```

This allocation divides all 5 items among the two agents, ensuring that each agent has a fair share based on their valuations.
