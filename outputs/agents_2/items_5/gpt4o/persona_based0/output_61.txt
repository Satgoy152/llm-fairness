Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  37  84  84   5
1  75  52  44  59  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll focus on achieving an envy-free allocation. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 64     | 37     | 84     | 84     | 5      |
| 1     | 75     | 52     | 44     | 59     | 90     |

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 64 + 37 + 84 + 84 + 5 = 274
- Agent 1: 75 + 52 + 44 + 59 + 90 = 320

Now, let's try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while aiming for an envy-free allocation.

One possible allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 4

Let's check the total value for each agent in this allocation:

- Agent 0's allocation: Item 0 (64) + Item 3 (84) = 148
- Agent 1's allocation: Item 1 (52) + Item 2 (44) + Item 4 (90) = 186

Each agent receives a majority of their valuation, and no agent envies the other's allocation given their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
