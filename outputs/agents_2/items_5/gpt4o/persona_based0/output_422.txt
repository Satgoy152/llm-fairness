Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  73   9   3  11
1  24  35  71  73  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items that is envy-free, we need to ensure that each agent gets a bundle of items such that they do not prefer the bundle of another agent over their own.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 73
  - Item 2: 9
  - Item 3: 3
  - Item 4: 11

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 24
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 71
  - Item 3: 73
  - Item 4: 39

To find an envy-free allocation, we can try to allocate items in such a way that the total value perceived by each agent for their assigned items is as balanced as possible.

### Steps to Determine the Allocation:

1. **High-value items for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0's high-value items are 0 and 1.
   - Agent 1's high-value items are 3 and 2.

2. **Initial Assignment**:
   - Assign item 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining Items**:
   - The remaining item is 4. 

4. **Assign Remaining Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 11.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 39.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it has a higher valuation for Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 3, 4.

This allocation ensures both agents receive items valued higher according to their preferences and minimizes potential envy.
