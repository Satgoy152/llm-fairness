Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  68  51  84  85
1  64  76  89  78  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can utilize the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while trying to maintain envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as that of the other agent based on their own valuations.

**Valuation Table:**

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 22 | 68 | 51 | 84 | 85 |
| 1          | 64 | 76 | 89 | 78 | 87 |

**Allocation Approach:**

1. **Calculate Total Valuation per Agent for Each Item:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 22 + 68 + 51 + 84 + 85 = 310
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 64 + 76 + 89 + 78 + 87 = 394

2. **Item Importance Ranking:**
   - Rank items for each agent based on their individual valuations.
   - Agent 0’s ranking (highest to lowest valuation): 4, 3, 1, 2, 0
   - Agent 1’s ranking (highest to lowest valuation): 2, 4, 1, 3, 0

3. **Greedy Allocation Based on Rankings:**
   - Allocate items to agents starting from the highest individual valuations without overlap, prioritizing the items that are most valuable to each agent.
   - Follow the order of preference for each agent and ensure no item is allocated more than once.

4. **Allocation Process:**
   - Assign item 4 to the agent who values it the most, which is Agent 1.
   - Assign item 3 to the agent who values it the most from the remaining items, which is Agent 0.
   - Continue this process until all items are allocated.

**Final Allocations:**

- Agent 0: Items 3, 1
- Agent 1: Items 4, 2, 0

These allocations are made to ensure that each agent receives items in such a way that the perceived value is maximized from their perspective, attempting to keep envy to a minimum.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4, 2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents feel they have received a fair share relative to their own valuations of the items.
