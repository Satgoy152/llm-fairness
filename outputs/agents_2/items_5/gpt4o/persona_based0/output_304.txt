Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  87  20  74  77
1  34  57  17  50  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we need to ensure that neither agent prefers the other agent's allocation over their own. We can achieve this by trying to balance the total value each agent perceives in their allocated items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 16 + 87 + 20 + 74 + 77 = 274
- Agent 1: 34 + 57 + 17 + 50 + 71 = 229

Now, we will attempt to allocate the items in a way that each agent receives an approximately equal total value according to their own valuations. One possible allocation is as follows:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued item for each agent, then balance the remaining items to achieve a fair total value distribution.
2. For Agent 0, the highest valued items are 1 and 4. For Agent 1, the highest valued items are 0 and 4.
3. Allocate items such that:
   - Agent 0 gets items 1 and 3
   - Agent 1 gets items 0, 2, and 4

Let's check the total value for each agent under this allocation:

- Agent 0: 87 (item 1) + 74 (item 3) = 161
- Agent 1: 34 (item 0) + 17 (item 2) + 71 (item 4) = 122

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that minimizes envy, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
