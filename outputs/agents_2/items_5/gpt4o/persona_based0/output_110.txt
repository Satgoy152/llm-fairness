Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  49  61  98  68
1  51  91  68   7  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims to minimize envy, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and allocate them in such a way that both agents feel they have received a fair share.

Here's a breakdown of the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 17
  - Item 1: 49
  - Item 2: 61
  - Item 3: 98
  - Item 4: 68

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 68
  - Item 3: 7
  - Item 4: 49

To minimize envy, we can use the following approach:

1. Identify the most valuable items for each agent and try to allocate them those items.
2. Ensure that the total value each agent perceives from their allocation is as balanced as possible.

Considering these points, the most straightforward allocation would be:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation (98) for them.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as it has the highest valuation (91) for them.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it is also highly valued (68) by both agents, but slightly more so by Agent 0.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as it is more valued by them (51) compared to Agent 0 (17).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it has a reasonably high value for both agents but slightly more so for Agent 0.

This allocation gives both agents a balanced share of their perceived value.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
