Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  68  83  85  53
1  64  45   1  25  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize their satisfaction relative to each other. The goal is to minimize envy, where each agent should feel that they received their fair share based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 95 + 68 + 83 + 85 + 53 = 384
- Agent 1: 64 + 45 + 1 + 25 + 61 = 196

Now, let's consider the items that each agent values the most and attempt to allocate them in a way that balances their total perceived value.

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**:  
   - Highest to lowest: Item 0 (95), Item 3 (85), Item 2 (83), Item 1 (68), Item 4 (53).

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:  
   - Highest to lowest: Item 0 (64), Item 4 (61), Item 1 (45), Item 3 (25), Item 2 (1).

Based on these preferences, let's allocate items to maximize both agents' satisfaction:

- **Allocate based on highest values:**
  - **Agent 0** has a strong preference for items 0, 3, and 2.
  - **Agent 1** values items 4 and 1 the most.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 3, 2  
  (Total value: 95 + 85 + 83 = 263)

- **Agent 1**: Items 4, 1  
  (Total value: 61 + 45 = 106)

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived fairness given the high discrepancy in valuations. Agent 0 receives the majority of their high-value items, while Agent 1 receives items they value reasonably well.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation is designed to ensure that each agent receives a fair share relative to their valuation of the items and minimizes envy to the extent possible given the disparity in valuations.
