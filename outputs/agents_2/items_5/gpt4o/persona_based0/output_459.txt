Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  61   6  52  39
1  17  69  73  61  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer to have another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided:

Agent 0's valuations: [51, 61, 6, 52, 39]  
Agent 1's valuations: [17, 69, 73, 61, 89]

We can follow these steps to find an allocation that aims for envy-freeness:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**

   - Agent 0's highest valued items are: Item 1 (61), Item 3 (52), and Item 0 (51).
   - Agent 1's highest valued items are: Item 4 (89), Item 2 (73), and Item 1 (69).

2. **Allocate high-value items to the respective agent who values them most:**

   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1, as they value it at 89.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it at 73.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it at 61.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it at 52.

3. **Allocate the remaining item, considering envy-freeness:**

   - The remaining item is Item 0.
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 51, and Agent 1 values it at 17.
   - It's more suitable for Agent 0 to receive Item 0 since they value it more.

After these allocations, we have:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0, 1, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives Items 2 and 4.

This allocation minimizes envy because each agent receives items that they value relatively highly compared to the other agent.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
