Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  19  82  74  72
1  97  89  55  32  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we need to allocate the 5 items between the 2 agents such that the allocation is fair, ideally minimizing envy between the agents. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent should value their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation given to the other agent.

First, let's summarize the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 2
  - Item 1: 19
  - Item 2: 82
  - Item 3: 74
  - Item 4: 72

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 55
  - Item 3: 32
  - Item 4: 49

A good approach is to try to assign items such that the total value of items for each agent is as balanced as possible, considering their valuations.

### Step 1: List items by descending value for each agent:

- For Agent 0: 
  - Item 2 (82), Item 3 (74), Item 4 (72), Item 1 (19), Item 0 (2)

- For Agent 1: 
  - Item 0 (97), Item 1 (89), Item 2 (55), Item 4 (49), Item 3 (32)

### Step 2: Initial allocation based on highest value

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: 
   - This is because Agent 1 values Item 0 the most (97), and it is much higher than Agent 0's value for it (2).

2. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (82), and Agent 1 values it less (55).

### Step 3: Continue allocation balancing values

3. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: 
   - This item is highly valued by Agent 1 (89), much more than by Agent 0 (19).

4. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0**:
   - This is the next best item for Agent 0 (74), and it's less valuable to Agent 1 (32).

5. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0**: 
   - This item is valued similarly by both, but Agent 0 values it slightly more (72 vs. 49).

### Step 4: Final Allocation

- Agent 0 receives items 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.

This allocation minimizes envy as much as possible given the constraints and ensures both agents receive items. Agent 0 has a total perceived value of 228, and Agent 1 has a total perceived value of 186 from their allocations.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
