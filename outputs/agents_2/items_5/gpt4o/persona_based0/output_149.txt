Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  56  53   1  27
1  87  97  73  32  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free, if possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's first consider the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [56, 56, 53, 1, 27]
- Agent 1's valuations: [87, 97, 73, 32, 10]

To allocate fairly, we'll proceed as follows:

1. Assign the item with the highest valuation for each agent, ensuring no overlaps.
2. Consider the remaining items and assign them to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

**Step 1: Assign the highest valued item to each agent**

- Agent 0 values item 0 and 1 the highest (both 56). We will choose item 0 for agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (97). We will choose item 1 for agent 1.

**Step 2: Assign remaining items**

After assigning item 0 to agent 0 and item 1 to agent 1, we have the following items left: 2, 3, and 4.

Let's evaluate the remaining items:

- For Agent 0, the next highest value is item 2 (53).
- For Agent 1, the next highest value is item 2 (73).

Given that both agents prefer item 2, we will allocate item 2 to agent 1 because it provides a greater increase in total valuation for agent 1 than for agent 0.

Now, the remaining items are 3 and 4:

- Agent 0 values item 4 more than item 3 (27 vs 1).
- Agent 1 values item 3 more than item 4 (32 vs 10).

Thus:
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 3

This allocation is fair, aiming to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
