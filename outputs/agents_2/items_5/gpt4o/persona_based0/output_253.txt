Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  90  29  57  51
1  87  40  55  11  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. This means each agent should perceive their allocation as being at least as good as the other agent's allocation.

Let's assess the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [42, 90, 29, 57, 51]
- Agent 1's valuations: [87, 40, 55, 11, 20]

We'll try to maximize each agent's total perceived value for the items they receive, while ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Prefers Item 1 (90) the most.
   - Next preferred is Item 3 (57).
   - Then, Item 4 (51).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Prefers Item 0 (87) the most.
   - Next preferred is Item 2 (55).

By allocating based on these preferences, we can try to balance the total perceived values:

- Give Agent 0 items 1, 3, and 4: Total value = 90 + 57 + 51 = 198
- Give Agent 1 items 0 and 2: Total value = 87 + 55 = 142

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items that maximize their respective valuations. Although Agent 0 receives more items, Agent 1 receives their highest-valued item, which helps maintain fairness.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
