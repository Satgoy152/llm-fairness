Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  24  60  44  41
1  49  87  46  29  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent values their allocation as equitably as possible, ideally achieving envy-freeness. We'll consider the agents' valuations and try to maximize the minimum satisfaction.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [40, 24, 60, 44, 41]
- Agent 1's valuations: [49, 87, 46, 29, 24]

We'll attempt to allocate the items such that the total value each agent perceives is as balanced as possible.

### Steps to Allocate:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 60.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 87.

2. **Assign these high-value items to each agent:**
   - Give item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Give item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Consider the remaining items: 0, 3, 4.
   - Look at Agent 0's valuations: Item 0 (40), Item 3 (44), Item 4 (41).
   - Look at Agent 1's valuations: Item 0 (49), Item 3 (29), Item 4 (24).

4. **Allocate based on next highest valuations:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (49 over 40).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (44 over 29).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (41 over 24).

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 0.

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives and minimizes envy.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 0]
}
```
