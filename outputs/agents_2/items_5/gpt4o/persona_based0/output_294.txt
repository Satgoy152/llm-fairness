Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  48  69  95  37
1  65  32  21  64  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 32 21 64 82]]
Output:
To ensure a fair division that minimizes envy, we will use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives, considering their valuations for each item. Given the items and valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [68, 48, 69, 95, 37].
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [65, 32, 21, 64, 82].

We aim to allocate the items to the agents in a way that optimizes their total perceived value and maintains envy-freeness as much as possible.

Let's evaluate each item based on the difference in valuations between the two agents, aiming to give items to the agent who values them more:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 68, and Agent 1 values it at 65. Agent 0 should get item 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 48, and Agent 1 values it at 32. Agent 0 should get item 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 69, and Agent 1 values it at 21. Agent 0 should get item 2.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 95, and Agent 1 values it at 64. Agent 0 should get item 3.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 37, and Agent 1 values it at 82. Agent 1 should get item 4.

However, this allocation gives 4 items to Agent 0 and 1 item to Agent 1. To ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and to balance the allocation:

Revised allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 2
- Agent 1 receives items: 3, 4

Thus, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
