Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  97  47  28  93
1  58   0  68  93  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58  0 68 93 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, if possible. An allocation is envy-free if each agent believes that they received at least as much value as any other agent received in their portion, given their own valuation of the items.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 56
  - Item 1: 97
  - Item 2: 47
  - Item 3: 28
  - Item 4: 93

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 68
  - Item 3: 93
  - Item 4: 84

Now, let's consider a fair allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 1 and Item 4 to Agent 0**:  
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 97 and Item 4 at 93, for a total of 190.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 at 0 and Item 4 at 84, for a total of 84.

2. **Allocate Item 0, Item 2, and Item 3 to Agent 1**:  
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 56, Item 2 at 47, and Item 3 at 28, for a total of 131.
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 58, Item 2 at 68, and Item 3 at 93, for a total of 219.

This allocation is fair because:

- Agent 0 receives items with a total value of 190 according to their own valuation, which is higher than the value they assign to the items allocated to Agent 1 (131).
- Agent 1 receives items with a total value of 219 according to their own valuation, which is higher than the value they assign to the items allocated to Agent 0 (84).

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation is both envy-free and ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, with all 5 items allocated.
