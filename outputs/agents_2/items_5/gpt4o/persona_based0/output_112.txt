Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  90  90  55  28
1  38  35  62  95  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division, we aim for an allocation where the agents have as equal total valuations as possible, and ideally, each agent feels that their share is fair given the circumstances. We will approach this problem by using the concept of envy-freeness where an agent should not prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 90
  - Item 3: 55
  - Item 4: 28

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 38
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 62
  - Item 3: 95
  - Item 4: 62

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent gets close to an equal share of the total value they perceive, and ideally, no agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Total value for Agent 0: 40 + 90 + 90 + 55 + 28 = 303
- Total value for Agent 1: 38 + 35 + 62 + 95 + 62 = 292

Now, let's try an allocation that balances the perceived value as evenly as possible:

1. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
3. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
4. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.
5. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

This allocation results in the following:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2, with a total value of 180 (90 + 90).
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 3, and 4, with a total value of 195 (38 + 95 + 62).

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent while ensuring every agent receives their share of items.
