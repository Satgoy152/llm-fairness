Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  39  52  45  11
1  76  80  36  52  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve a division where each agent values their received items at least as much as the other agent values their own allocation. This is known as an envy-free allocation. Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 11     | 39     | 52     | 45     | 11     |
| 1     | 76     | 80     | 36     | 52     | 93     |

We aim to find an allocation where each agent's total valuation is maximized for their assigned items while minimizing envy. Let's go through a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items with higher valuations, which are items 2 and 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items with higher valuations, which are items 0, 1, and 4.

Based on this preference, the allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2 (52) and 3 (45) with a total value of 97.
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 (76), 1 (80), and 4 (93) with a total value of 249.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, reducing potential envy. To present the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 5 items and attempts to minimize envy by aligning closely with the agents' preferences.
