Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  49  65  46  96
1  85  44  98  21  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of the other agent more than their own. Let's evaluate the agents' valuations for the items:

- Agent 0's valuations: [18, 49, 65, 46, 96]
- Agent 1's valuations: [85, 44, 98, 21, 99]

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we need to consider each agent's preferences and ensure that neither agent would prefer the other's allocation over their own.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 18 + 49 + 65 + 46 + 96 = 274
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 85 + 44 + 98 + 21 + 99 = 347

Now, let's try to allocate the items:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as it holds the highest value (99) for them.
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it is the next highest value (98) for them.
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as it is the next highest value (85) for them.

Agent 1 has now received items 0, 2, and 4.

4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 1 has already received three high-value items.
5. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it ensures a split and is the remaining item.

Agent 0 has now received items 1 and 3.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0's allocated items: 1 and 3, with total value = 49 + 46 = 95
- Agent 1's allocated items: 0, 2, and 4, with total value = 85 + 98 + 99 = 282

This allocation ensures that Agent 1, who has higher valuations overall, receives more items, but Agent 0 receives their highest-valued remaining items to balance fairness.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
