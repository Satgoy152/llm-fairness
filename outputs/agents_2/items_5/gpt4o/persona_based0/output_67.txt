Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  56  38  95  22
1   6  72  46  64  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items and considering the valuations provided, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to it as possible.

The table of valuations is as follows:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 36      | 6       |
| 1    | 56      | 72      |
| 2    | 38      | 46      |
| 3    | 95      | 64      |
| 4    | 22      | 41      |

The goal is to distribute these 5 items between the two agents in a way that minimizes envy and respects their valuations.

One approach to achieve this is to assign items such that each agent receives the items they value relatively higher than the other agent. 

Let's analyze the items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 values it at 6. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 values it at 72. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 38, Agent 1 values it at 46. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 values it at 64. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 41. Assign to Agent 1.

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 will receive items: 0, 3
- Agent 1 will receive items: 1, 2, 4

This allocation respects the agents' valuations as much as possible, given the constraints of an integer allocation.

The final allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
