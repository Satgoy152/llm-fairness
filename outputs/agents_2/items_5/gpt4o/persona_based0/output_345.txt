Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  98  66  82  25
1  75  34  49  84  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle. We aim to achieve an allocation where the sum of valuations for each agent's allocated items is as balanced as possible.

Consider the following valuations:

- Agent 0: [54, 98, 66, 82, 25]
- Agent 1: [75, 34, 49, 84, 21]

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can compare the total valuations each agent has for different combinations of items and ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's calculate the total valuations for a few feasible allocations and choose one that minimizes envy:

1. **Allocation 1:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 3, 4]
   - Agent 0's valuation: 98 (item 1) + 66 (item 2) = 164
   - Agent 1's valuation: 75 (item 0) + 84 (item 3) + 21 (item 4) = 180

2. **Allocation 2:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 4]
   - Agent 0's valuation: 54 (item 0) + 82 (item 3) = 136
   - Agent 1's valuation: 34 (item 1) + 49 (item 2) + 21 (item 4) = 104

3. **Allocation 3:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 4]
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 3]
   - Agent 0's valuation: 54 (item 0) + 98 (item 1) + 25 (item 4) = 177
   - Agent 1's valuation: 49 (item 2) + 84 (item 3) = 133

After considering these allocations, Allocation 3 is chosen since it provides a relatively balanced distribution of total valuations between the agents.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
