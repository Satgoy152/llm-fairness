Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  69   8  51  31
1  77  34  98  69  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as what the other agent received, from their own perspective.

Here are the valuations again for reference:

- Agent 0: [44, 69, 8, 51, 31]
- Agent 1: [77, 34, 98, 69, 21]

A potential way to allocate the items is to give each agent the highest valued items according to their own valuation, while ensuring the total value is balanced.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: 1 (69), 3 (51)
   - Total value: 69 + 51 = 120

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: 2 (98), 0 (77), 4 (21)
   - Total value: 98 + 77 + 21 = 196

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receiving items [1, 3]
- Agent 1 receiving items [0, 2, 4]

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value most, given the constraints, and all items are allocated.
