Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47  33  86  65  55
1  72   0  79  15  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations of the items for each agent and try to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should ideally feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of the other agent based on their own valuations.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [47, 33, 86, 65, 55]
- Agent 1's valuations: [72, 0, 79, 15, 13]

First, consider the items that have the largest difference in valuation between the agents:

1. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 86, and Agent 1 values it at 79. The difference is 7.
2. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 47, and Agent 1 values it at 72. The difference is 25.
3. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 65, and Agent 1 values it at 15. The difference is 50.
4. **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 55, and Agent 1 values it at 13. The difference is 42.
5. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 33, and Agent 1 values it at 0. The difference is 33.

We should allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's perceived value while minimizing envy. Let's attempt an allocation:

1. **Item 2:** It's close in valuation for both agents, but Agent 0 values it slightly more. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values this item significantly more. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values this more. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 4:** Agent 0 values this more. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values this more, but to balance the allocation, let's give this to Agent 1.

With this allocation, Agent 0 gets items 2, 3, and 4, and Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1. This allocation respects the valuations and attempts to reduce envy.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
