Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2  3   4
0  24  75  11  2  20
1  30  51  78  7  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly and in an envy-free manner, we will use the method of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that the allocation is as balanced as possible. Given that we have two agents and five items, we can aim for an allocation where each agent gets approximately half of the total value.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Valuation for Each Agent
First, calculate how much each agent values all the items.

- **Agent 0**: 24 + 75 + 11 + 2 + 20 = 132
- **Agent 1**: 30 + 51 + 78 + 7 + 43 = 209

### Step 2: Consider Item Valuations
Now, consider the individual valuations for each item by both agents:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 = 24, Agent 1 = 30
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 = 75, Agent 1 = 51
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 = 11, Agent 1 = 78
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 = 2, Agent 1 = 7
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 = 20, Agent 1 = 43

### Step 3: Allocate Items
We will try to allocate the items to maximize the value for each agent and ensure an equitable distribution.

1. **Agent 0**: Has higher valuation for item 1.
2. **Agent 1**: Has higher valuation for item 2 and item 4.

Let's allocate based on these observations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 1
  - Total valuation = 24 + 75 = 99
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 3, and 4
  - Total valuation = 78 + 7 + 43 = 128

### Step 4: Review Allocation
Check if the allocation is envy-free:
- Agent 0 values their items at 99 and Agent 1's items at 11 + 2 + 20 = 33, so there's no envy.
- Agent 1 values their items at 128 and Agent 0's items at 51, so there's no envy.

The allocation seems fair given the constraints and the goal of reducing envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
