Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  26  48  52  19
1  19  17  99  79  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated.

Let's examine the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0: [20, 26, 48, 52, 19]
- Agent 1: [19, 17, 99, 79, 82]

To minimize envy, we should try to allocate items such that each agent values their own bundle of items at least as much as they would value the other agent's bundle.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 1 values item 2 the most (99), so we should start by allocating item 2 to Agent 1.
2. Next, Agent 1 values item 4 highly (82), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 0 values item 3 the most (52), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 0 also values item 2 highly (48), but it's already allocated to Agent 1. The next highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 1 (26), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
5. Finally, we allocate item 0, which has the smallest value for both agents, but Agent 0 values it slightly more (20 vs. 19), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

This allocation results in the following distribution:

Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 3, which they value at 20 + 26 + 52 = 98.
Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4, which they value at 99 + 82 = 181.

While this allocation isn't perfectly envy-free, it does attempt to distribute the highest-valued items according to each agent's preferences, minimizing potential envy given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
