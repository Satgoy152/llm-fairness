Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  61  88  97  64
1  31  49   8  47  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents, we should strive for an envy-free allocation, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they would value the allocation of the other agent.

Let's analyze the situation:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 75
- Item 1: 61
- Item 2: 88
- Item 3: 97
- Item 4: 64

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 31
- Item 1: 49
- Item 2: 8
- Item 3: 47
- Item 4: 94

We need to allocate the 5 items such that both agents feel they have received a fair share. One approach is to maximize the total value that each agent receives based on their individual valuations, while ensuring that the allocation is as balanced as possible.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0. This item has the highest value (97) for Agent 0.
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 1. This item has the highest value (94) for Agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0. This item has a high value (88) for Agent 0.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 0. This item has a value of 75 for Agent 0, which is relatively high.
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 1. This item has a value of 49 for Agent 1, which is the second highest value in their list.

This allocation results in the following:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 3 valued at 75, 88, and 97 respectively, totaling 260.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4 valued at 49 and 94 respectively, totaling 143.

In this way, both agents receive items that are valued highly according to their own valuations. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation provides Agent 0 with three items they highly value, and Agent 1 with two items they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated.
