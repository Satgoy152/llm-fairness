Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  76  46  73  94
1   9   7  12  17  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness to the extent possible given the constraints. In this problem, we have two agents and five items. The goal is to allocate these items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, which can be challenging when the agents have significantly different valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has the following valuations for the items: [77, 76, 46, 73, 94]
- Agent 1 has the following valuations for the items: [9, 7, 12, 17, 36]

The total value each agent assigns to all items is:
- Agent 0: 77 + 76 + 46 + 73 + 94 = 366
- Agent 1: 9 + 7 + 12 + 17 + 36 = 81

Given these valuations, we want to allocate the items to maximize satisfaction for both agents. A possible approach is to give each agent items they value highly, ensuring that no agent feels envious of the otherâ€™s allocation.

**Step-by-step allocation approach:**

1. Prioritize allocating items that have the highest value difference between the two agents to the agent who values them more.
   
2. Start by allocating item 4, which has the highest value for agent 0 (94 vs. 36 for agent 1).

3. Allocate item 3 next, as agent 0 values it significantly more than agent 1 (73 vs. 17).

4. Allocate item 2 to agent 0, since agent 0 values it more than agent 1 (46 vs. 12).

5. For items 0 and 1, agent 0 values them significantly more than agent 1. However, to ensure agent 1 gets items, allocate item 0 to agent 1 (9 vs. 77 for agent 0) to give agent 1 some satisfaction.

6. Finally, allocate item 1 to agent 0 (76 vs. 7 for agent 1).

**Final allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 2, 3, 4]
- Agent 1 receives item [0]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and agent 1 receives an item, even though agent 0 values most items higher. This approach aims to reduce envy while acknowledging the disparity in valuations.

**Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0]
}
```
