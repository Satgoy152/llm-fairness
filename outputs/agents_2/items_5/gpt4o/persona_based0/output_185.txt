Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  30  52  71  78
1  98  77  96  95  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents such that we achieve envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items.

Here is the table of valuations for clarity:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 75     | 30     | 52     | 71     | 78     |
| 1     | 98     | 77     | 96     | 95     | 54     |

To achieve a fair division, we can follow these steps:

1. Each agent should receive items such that no agent envies the other, meaning agent i's total valuation of their bundle should be at least as high as their valuation of any other agent's bundle.
2. We aim to maximize the utility for each agent within the constraints.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highly values items 4 (78) and 0 (75).
- Agent 1 highly values items 0 (98) and 2 (96).

Let's try to balance the allocation:

1. Give item 4 to Agent 0.
2. Give item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Give item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Give item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Give item 1 to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation ensures each agent has a high-value item and attempts to balance the total valuation for each.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to be as fair as possible given the constraints and valuations.
