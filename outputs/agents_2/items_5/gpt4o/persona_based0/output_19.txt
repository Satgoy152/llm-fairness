Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  31  79  12  82
1   3  50  97  40  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while attempting to achieve envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair portion of the total value based on their own preferences.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [69, 31, 79, 12, 82]
- Agent 1's valuations: [3, 50, 97, 40, 64]

Let's consider each item and allocate them to maximize fairness:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 69, while Agent 1 values it at 3.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 31, while Agent 1 values it at 50.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 79, while Agent 1 values it at 97.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 12, while Agent 1 values it at 40.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 82, while Agent 1 values it at 64.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

After this allocation, the distribution is:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, and 3

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their own valuations. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
