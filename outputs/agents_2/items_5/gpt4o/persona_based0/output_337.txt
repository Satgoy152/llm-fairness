Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  41  93  10  13
1  93  56   9  48  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents in a way that aims for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's overall satisfaction given their valuations.

Let's first list the total valuations for each agent if they were to receive all items:

- Agent 0: 27 + 41 + 93 + 10 + 13 = 184
- Agent 1: 93 + 56 + 9 + 48 + 89 = 295

The goal is to distribute these five items such that each agent's allocation is as fair as possible given their preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

One approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that the allocation remains balanced. Let's assign the items step by step:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it higher (93 vs. 27), allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it higher (56 vs. 41), allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it higher (93 vs. 9), allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it higher (48 vs. 10), allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it higher (89 vs. 13), allocate to Agent 1.

After this allocation, Agent 0 has 1 item (Item 2) and Agent 1 has 4 items (Items 0, 1, 3, and 4). Although this allocation is heavily skewed towards Agent 1, it reflects their stronger preferences for the majority of the items.

Let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 5 items with no item left unallocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
