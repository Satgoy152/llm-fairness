Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  65  55  37  72
1  21  38  65  49  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [21 38 65 49 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should look at the agents' valuations and attempt to distribute the items in a manner that minimizes envy. 

To do this, let's first observe the valuation table:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [16, 65, 55, 37, 72]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [21, 38, 65, 49, 18]

Next, let's consider possible allocations:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Total value for Agent 0: 16 + 65 + 55 + 37 + 72 = 245
   - Total value for Agent 1: 21 + 38 + 65 + 49 + 18 = 191

2. Given that Agent 0 has a higher total valuation, they might be more flexible in terms of which items they receive. We can try to balance the perceived value each agent receives by considering their highest valuations.

3. Allocate items to maximize each agent's value while minimizing envy:
   - Agent 0's highest valued items are: 4 (72) and 1 (65)
   - Agent 1's highest valued items are: 2 (65) and 3 (49)

4. Assign items based on the above analysis:
   - Agent 0 receives items: 1 and 4
   - Agent 1 receives items: 2 and 3

5. This leaves item 0, which has relatively low value for both agents. Assign item 0 to the agent with the least total value to balance the allocation:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 4: Values are 65 + 72 = 137
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, and 3: Values are 21 + 65 + 49 = 135

This allocation is relatively balanced, minimizing the potential for envy, as both agents receive approximately equal total values based on their valuations.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
