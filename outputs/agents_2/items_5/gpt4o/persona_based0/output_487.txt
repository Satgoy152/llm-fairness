Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  10  22  64  13
1   8  65   4  76  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation based on the given valuations while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll analyze the agents' valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

Here is a breakdown of the items and their valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 24
  - Item 1: 10
  - Item 2: 22
  - Item 3: 64
  - Item 4: 13

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 8
  - Item 1: 65
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 76
  - Item 4: 21

To ensure an envy-free allocation, we need to consider each agent's preferences and try to maximize their satisfaction by giving them items they value more.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 3**: This is the highest valued item for both agents. Agent 1 values it at 76, which is more than any other item for both agents, so we allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: The next highest valued item for Agent 1 is Item 1 (65). We allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values Item 0 considerably (24), which is the highest among the remaining items for Agent 0. We allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item at 22, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation (4). We allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: This item has a valuation of 21 for Agent 1 and 13 for Agent 0. Since Agent 1 does not yet have 3 items, we allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

With this allocation, each agent receives items based on their preferences, aiming to minimize envy:

- Agent 0 receives items they value at 24 and 22.
- Agent 1 receives items they value at 76, 65, and 21.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
