Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42   0  65  51  47
1  36  85  25  48  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a way that is fair and envy-free, we want to ensure that each agent feels that they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Let's analyze the valuations provided by each agent for the items:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 42 
  - Item 1: 0 
  - Item 2: 65 
  - Item 3: 51 
  - Item 4: 47

- Agent 1 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 36 
  - Item 1: 85 
  - Item 2: 25 
  - Item 3: 48 
  - Item 4: 52

Given this, one strategy to achieve fairness and envy-freeness is to allocate items by considering the highest valued items for each agent without causing significant envy.

1. **Item 1** has the highest value for Agent 1 (85) and a value of 0 for Agent 0. Therefore, it's clearly best to allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 2** is valued highly by Agent 0 (65), and less by Agent 1 (25). Therefore, it's best to allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 3** is valued more by Agent 0 (51) than Agent 1 (48). Since the difference is small, allocating this item to Agent 1 would balance the allocation better, given Agent 1 already has a high-value item.

4. **Item 4** is valued at 47 by Agent 0 and 52 by Agent 1. Allocating this to Agent 1 makes sense as Agent 0 already has Item 2 which is highly valued for them.

5. **Item 0** is valued at 42 by Agent 0 and 36 by Agent 1. Allocating this to Agent 0 would balance the allocation further since Agent 1 has already received two of their higher-valued items.

Thus, the allocations will be:

- Agent 0: [0, 2]
- Agent 1: [1, 3, 4]

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items that they value highly, and it minimizes envy between the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
