Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  75  57  33  41
1  17  62  17  59  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to create an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items such that no agent prefers the set of items received by another agent over their own.

Let's examine the valuations and identify a possible allocation strategy:

**Agent 0's valuations:**

- Item 0: 61
- Item 1: 75
- Item 2: 57
- Item 3: 33
- Item 4: 41

**Agent 1's valuations:**

- Item 0: 17
- Item 1: 62
- Item 2: 17
- Item 3: 59
- Item 4: 51

To create a fair division, we can try to allocate the items such that each agent gets a similar total valuation based on their individual preferences.

### Possible Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Given that Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, and 2, we can allocate these to Agent 0.
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 61 (Item 0) + 75 (Item 1) + 57 (Item 2) = 193

2. **Agent 1**: We can allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 1, as these are relatively more valuable to Agent 1 compared to Agent 0.
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 59 (Item 3) + 51 (Item 4) = 110

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives a higher valuation sum, aligning with their stronger preferences, while Agent 1 receives items that are more valuable to them relative to Agent 0's valuation.

This allocation is envy-free under the assumption that each agent evaluates their bundle based on their own valuations, as neither agent would trade their allocation with the other given their individual valuations.

### Allocations:

{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
