Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  35  78  31   3
1  78  35  55  69  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our objective is to allocate the items such that each agent has a bundle that maximizes their satisfaction based on their own valuations.

Here are the valuations from the table:

- Agent 0 values: [93, 35, 78, 31, 3]
- Agent 1 values: [78, 35, 55, 69, 97]

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 93 + 35 + 78 + 31 + 3 = 240
- Total value for Agent 1: 78 + 35 + 55 + 69 + 97 = 334

To ensure fairness, we'll allocate items such that the perceived total value for each agent is as close as possible to half of the total value they assign to all items. Half of the total value for each agent is:

- Half value for Agent 0: 240 / 2 = 120
- Half value for Agent 1: 334 / 2 = 167

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Start by allocating the highest-valued item for each agent until their total perceived value is closest to their half total value.

2. For Agent 0, the highest-valued item is item 0 (value 93). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

3. For Agent 1, the highest-valued item is item 4 (value 97). Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

4. Now, consider the second highest-valued items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (value 78)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (value 69)

5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, bringing their total perceived value to 93 + 78 = 171.

6. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, bringing their total perceived value to 97 + 69 = 166.

7. Finally, allocate the remaining items to balance the allocations:
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0. Now Agent 0 has items [0, 2, 1] with total perceived value 171 (93 + 78 + 35).

8. Agent 1 receives the final item, item 3, so Agent 1 has items [4, 3] with total perceived value 166 (97 + 69).

Given these allocations, both agents have received items that maximize their total perceived value close to their half total value, ensuring a fair distribution with minimized envy.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
