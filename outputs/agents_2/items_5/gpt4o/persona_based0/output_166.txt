Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  40  78  95  47
1  34  42  26  55  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a solution that minimizes envy between the agents. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation given to any other agent, based on their own valuation of the items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [68, 40, 78, 95, 47]
- Agent 1's valuations: [34, 42, 26, 55, 99]

To accomplish a fair and envy-free allocation, we can use a strategy where each agent receives items they value highly compared to the other agent's valuation of the same item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 95, while Agent 1 values it at 55. Give this item to Agent 0, as they value it significantly more.

2. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it at 99, while Agent 0 values it at 47. Give this item to Agent 1, as they value it significantly more.

3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 78, while Agent 1 values it at 26. Give this item to Agent 0.

4. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 68, while Agent 1 values it at 34. Give this item to Agent 0.

5. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it at 42, while Agent 0 values it at 40. Although both agents have similar valuations, Agent 1 has fewer items so far, so we give this item to Agent 1.

Now, we have the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
