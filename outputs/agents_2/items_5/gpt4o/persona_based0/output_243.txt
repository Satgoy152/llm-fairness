Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  82  45   2  29
1  20  95  50  58   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share, which means no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent to their own.

Here are the valuations from the table:

- Agent 0 values: [8, 82, 45, 2, 29]
- Agent 1 values: [20, 95, 50, 58, 4]

Let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 8 + 82 + 45 + 2 + 29 = 166
- Total value for Agent 1: 20 + 95 + 50 + 58 + 4 = 227

Now, let's find an allocation that is as envy-free as possible by trying to give each agent the items they value more, while keeping the total number of items given to each agent an integer and ensuring all items are allocated.

1. Agent 0 should receive items that maximize their perceived value, particularly those that Agent 1 values less.
2. Agent 1 should receive the remaining items in a way that maximizes their perceived value.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 4
  - Valuations: 82 (item 1) + 29 (item 4) = 111

- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 2, 3
  - Valuations: 20 (item 0) + 50 (item 2) + 58 (item 3) = 128

This allocation aims to minimize envy based on the highest possible individual item valuations and their perceived total value.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items in a way that is as fair as possible given the constraints, and all items are allocated.
