Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  20  67  93  30
1  27  77  97  42  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will employ the method of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This method ensures that the least happy agent is as happy as possible, reducing envy.

First, let's summarize the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: 22, 20, 67, 93, 30
- Agent 1's valuations: 27, 77, 97, 42, 44

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total for Agent 0: 22 + 20 + 67 + 93 + 30 = 232
- Total for Agent 1: 27 + 77 + 97 + 42 + 44 = 287

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize the minimum value:

1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for them (93).
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for them (97).
3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as it has the second-highest value for them (77).
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it has a relatively higher value for them (22) compared to Agent 1 (27).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it balances the total number of items received by each agent and has a higher value for them (30) compared to Agent 1 (44).

The allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 3, 0, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 1.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 93 + 22 + 30 = 145
- Agent 1's total valuation: 97 + 77 = 174

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 4],
    "1": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.
