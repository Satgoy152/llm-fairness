Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  65  91  72  17
1  25  14  24  21  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation for the given problem, we need to distribute the items among the agents such that no agent prefers the items allocated to another agent more than their own. Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  65  91  72  17
1  25  14  24  21  51
```

Based on the valuations provided:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (91), followed by item 3 (72), item 1 (65), item 4 (17), and item 0 (9).
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (51), followed by item 0 (25), item 2 (24), item 3 (21), and item 1 (14).

An envy-free allocation can be achieved by ensuring each agent receives items they value highly relative to the other agent. Here's a potential allocation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 1. Agent 1 values this item more (25) than agent 0 (9).
- Assign item 1 to agent 0. Agent 0 values this item more (65) than agent 1 (14).
- Assign item 2 to agent 0. Agent 0 values this item more (91) than agent 1 (24).
- Assign item 3 to agent 0. Agent 0 values this item more (72) than agent 1 (21).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1. Agent 1 values this item more (51) than agent 0 (17).

This allocation gives agent 0 the items they value the most (1, 2, and 3) and agent 1 the items they value the most (0 and 4). Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures an envy-free distribution of items among the agents based on the given valuations.
