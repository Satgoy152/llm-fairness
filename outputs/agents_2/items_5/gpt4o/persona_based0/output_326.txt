Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  91  39  83  86
1  20  94   3  73   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations provided:

```
Agent 0: [5, 91, 39, 83, 86]
Agent 1: [20, 94, 3, 73, 7]
```

A simple way to approach this is to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible. We'll consider giving each agent the items where their valuations are relatively higher compared to the other agent, aiming to minimize envy.

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 5
   - Agent 1 values it at 20
   - Assign to Agent 1

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 91
   - Agent 1 values it at 94
   - Assign to Agent 1 (since the valuation is higher)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 39
   - Agent 1 values it at 3
   - Assign to Agent 0

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 83
   - Agent 1 values it at 73
   - Assign to Agent 0

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 86
   - Agent 1 values it at 7
   - Assign to Agent 0

After allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1

Let’s check the total valuations:

- **Agent 0's total value**: 39 (Item 2) + 83 (Item 3) + 86 (Item 4) = 208
- **Agent 1's total value**: 20 (Item 0) + 94 (Item 1) = 114

This allocation balances the total values while considering each agent's preferences, minimizing envy.

Here’s the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
