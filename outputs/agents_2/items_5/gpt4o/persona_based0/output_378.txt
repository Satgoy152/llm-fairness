Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  57  72  85  89
1  52  70  20  18  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free and each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [49, 57, 72, 85, 89]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [52, 70, 20, 18, 28]

A potential fair allocation should consider maximizing the perceived value each agent receives relative to their total potential value. We can follow a simple allocation strategy by assigning items to the agent who values them the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 52, and Agent 0 values it at 49. Therefore, assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 70, and Agent 0 values it at 57. Therefore, assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 72, and Agent 1 values it at 20. Therefore, assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 85, and Agent 1 values it at 18. Therefore, assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 89, and Agent 1 values it at 28. Therefore, assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
