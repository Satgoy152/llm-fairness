Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  65  83  24  35
1  58  10  53  83  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation. An allocation is envy-free if each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as they value the bundle of the other agent.

We have the following valuations:

- Agent 0: [55, 65, 83, 24, 35]
- Agent 1: [58, 10, 53, 83, 70]

To find an envy-free allocation, we'll try to distribute the items such that the total value each agent gets is as balanced as possible according to their valuations.

1. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Allocate items to the agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets items that maximize their perceived value.
   - Consider the total value each agent obtains to minimize envy.

2. **Valuation Analysis:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 83.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 83.
   - We should consider giving each agent these highest-value items first.

3. **Allocating Remaining Items:**
   - Assign the remaining items by maximizing the total value each agent gets, aiming to balance their perceived total values as much as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 83 for Agent 0).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 83 for Agent 1).

Now, we have the remaining items: 0, 1, 4.

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 55 for Agent 0, 58 for Agent 1).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 35 for Agent 0, 70 for Agent 1).

Finally, item 1 remains:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 65 for Agent 0, 10 for Agent 1).

**Total Valuations:**
- Agent 0: 83 (item 2) + 55 (item 0) + 65 (item 1) = 203
- Agent 1: 83 (item 3) + 70 (item 4) = 153

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items they value more as a bundle, but Agent 1 has a fair share considering their own valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
