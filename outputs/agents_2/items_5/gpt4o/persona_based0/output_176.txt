Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  43  72  25  89
1  94  26  34  32  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [94 26 34 32 46]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use a method known as the "Envy-Free Allocation" approach. The goal here is to make sure that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items based on their valuations, and ideally, each agent does not envy the other's allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 29, 43, 72, 25, 89
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: 94, 26, 34, 32, 46

We need to allocate all 5 items, and each agent should receive an integer number of items.

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Assigning Item 4 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 89, and Agent 1 values it at 46. This item is significantly more valuable to Agent 0.

2. **Assigning Item 0 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 29, and Agent 1 values it at 94. This item is significantly more valuable to Agent 1.

3. **Assigning Item 2 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 72, and Agent 1 values it at 34. This item is more valuable to Agent 0.

4. **Assigning Item 1 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 43, and Agent 1 values it at 26. This is a relatively small difference, but given the previous allocations, it helps balance the allocation.

5. **Assigning Item 3 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 25, and Agent 1 values it at 32. This item is slightly more valuable to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 3.

This allocation considers the agents' preferences and attempts to distribute the items in a manner that minimizes envy given the difference in valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
