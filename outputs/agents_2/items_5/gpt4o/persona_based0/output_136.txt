Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  60  17  19  19
1  52  18  30  33  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division where each agent receives items that they value fairly relative to what the other agent receives. One approach to achieve this is by maximizing the total value each agent perceives from the items they receive while ensuring that no agent envies the allocation of the other.

We have the following valuations:

- Agent 0: [61, 60, 17, 19, 19]
- Agent 1: [52, 18, 30, 33, 91]

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 52.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 values it at 18.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 17, Agent 1 values it at 30.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 values it at 33.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 values it at 91.

To ensure a fair allocation:

1. Start by assigning items that are highly valued by one agent and less valued by the other. This minimizes envy.
2. Attempt to balance the total value each agent receives.

To find a fair allocation, let's assign:

- Item 0 to Agent 0 (valued at 61 compared to 52 by Agent 1)
- Item 1 to Agent 0 (valued at 60 compared to 18 by Agent 1)
- Item 2 to Agent 1 (valued at 30 compared to 17 by Agent 0)
- Item 3 to Agent 1 (valued at 33 compared to 19 by Agent 0)
- Item 4 to Agent 1 (valued at 91 compared to 19 by Agent 0)

Now let's check the total perceived value for each agent:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1: Total value = 61 + 60 = 121
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 3, and 4: Total value = 30 + 33 + 91 = 154

This allocation is fair in terms of maximizing each agent's perceived value from their allocation while minimizing envy because each agent receives the items they value more highly.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
