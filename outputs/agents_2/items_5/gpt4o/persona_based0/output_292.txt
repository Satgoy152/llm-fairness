Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  91  63  92  59
1  88  20  85  18  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider the notion of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of the other agent, based on their individual valuations.

Here's the valuation table for clarity:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   65   |   91   |   63   |   92   |   59   |
|   1   |   88   |   20   |   85   |   18   |   52   |

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can perform the following steps:

1. Identify the most valued item for each agent and allocate it to them if possible.
2. Ensure the total value of items allocated to each agent is balanced according to their preferences.

- Agent 0 values Item 3 the highest (92), followed by Item 1 (91).
- Agent 1 values Item 0 the highest (88), followed by Item 2 (85).

Let's allocate the items:

1. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 because it is highly valued by Agent 0.
2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 because it is highly valued by Agent 1.
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 since it is their next highest valued item.
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 since it is their next highest valued item.
5. Finally, allocate the remaining Item 4 to Agent 0 to balance the number of items.

The allocations can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items based on their preferences, and all items are distributed. Agent 0 receives items 1, 3, and 4, while Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.
