Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  97   9  38  91
1  18  88  30  16  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to minimize envy. One approach is to use the "Envy-Free Matchings" method, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Here are the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 valuations: [49, 97, 9, 38, 91]
- Agent 1 valuations: [18, 88, 30, 16, 25]

We want to allocate the items such that neither agent envies the other's allocation. A simple method to attempt this is to look for allocations where each agent's total value is as balanced as possible, or where each agent receives their most valued items.

1. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Consider the highest valued items for each agent.
   - Allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction.

2. **Allocation:**

   - Agent 0 highly values items 1 (97) and 4 (91).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (88) and item 2 (30).

3. **Allocate items:**

   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it significantly increases Agent 0's valuation.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it is also highly valued by Agent 0.
   - Assign items 0, 2, and 3 to Agent 1, as they provide the best value to Agent 1.

4. **Resulting Allocation:**

   - Agent 0 gets items 1 and 4.
   - Agent 1 gets items 0, 2, and 3.

This allocation aims to balance the overall satisfaction by giving Agent 0 the sum of higher valued items based on their preferences while also providing Agent 1 with items that yield them more total value.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
