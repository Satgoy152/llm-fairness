Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  35  96  60  35
1  49   4   7  28   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to give each agent a bundle of items such that neither agent would prefer the other's bundle over their own.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(53 + 35 + 96 + 60 + 35 = 279\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(49 + 4 + 7 + 28 + 8 = 96\)

Given these valuations, it's clear that Agent 0 places a much higher total value on the items than Agent 1. Our task is to allocate the items in a way that reflects these valuations fairly.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 96. This is a significant portion of Agent 0's total valuation.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 49.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0's remaining items are valued at 35, 60, and 35.
   - Agent 1's remaining items are valued at 4, 7, 28, and 8.

4. **Complete Allocation:**
   - After careful consideration, we allocate:
     - Item 3 to Agent 0 (60) since it is the next highest value for Agent 0.
     - Item 1 and item 4 to Agent 1 (4 and 8) since they fit well with the remaining valuation for Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 1, and 4.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items according to their preferences, and no agent would prefer to switch with the other given their current allocation.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
