Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74   5  51  79  85
1  40  13  28  23  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 74 + 5 + 51 + 79 + 85 = 294
- Agent 1's total value: 40 + 13 + 28 + 23 + 35 = 139

We can consider an allocation that tries to balance the total value each agent receives from their allocated items.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 4 the most (85), so initially allocate it to them.
2. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 0:** The next highest-valued item for Agent 0 is item 3 (79).
3. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1:** To balance the allocation, allocate an item with significant value for Agent 1. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (40).
4. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0:** The next highest-valued item for Agent 0 is item 2 (51).
5. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1:** Finally, allocate item 1 to Agent 1 to ensure all items are distributed.

**Final allocations:**

- Agent 0 gets items 4, 3, and 2 with a total value of 79 + 51 + 85 = 215.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1 with a total value of 40 + 13 = 53.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a share of the items, with Agent 0 receiving a higher total value due to their higher overall valuation of the items. However, this allocation is not envy-free, as Agent 1 values items 3 and 4 more than items 0 and 1. But given the significant difference in the valuation of items, it is challenging to achieve envy-freeness without compromising on the total value received by the agents.

**Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
