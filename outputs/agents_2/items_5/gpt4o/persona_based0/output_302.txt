Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  76  37  35  45
1  36  53  90  73  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1) while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to balance the perceived value each agent receives. The goal is to distribute the items so that neither agent feels envious of the other's allocation.

Let's examine the valuations given:

- Agent 0 values:  
  - Item 0: 39
  - Item 1: 76
  - Item 2: 37
  - Item 3: 35
  - Item 4: 45

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 53
  - Item 2: 90
  - Item 3: 73
  - Item 4: 44

One approach is to calculate the total value each agent would receive for different allocations and try to make them as balanced as possible. A simple greedy method is to allocate items one by one to the agent who values them more, but ensuring that the overall distribution is fair by checking total values.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 2** (highest value for Agent 1):
   - Agent 1 values it at 90, while Agent 0 values it at 37.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1** (second highest value for Agent 0):
   - Agent 0 values it at 76, while Agent 1 values it at 53.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 3** (second highest value for Agent 1):
   - Agent 1 values it at 73, while Agent 0 values it at 35.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 39, while Agent 1 values it at 36.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4** (remaining item):
   - Agent 0 values it at 45, while Agent 1 values it at 44.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

### Total Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 0, 4] with values [76, 39, 45] = 160
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 3] with values [90, 73] = 163

This allocation is reasonably fair, as the total values each agent receives are quite close.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent's total valuation is balanced to minimize envy.
