Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  81  70  57  75
1  73   9  73  27  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while minimizing envy, we need to consider their valuations for each item. The goal is to allocate the items so that each agent perceives they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 95 + 81 + 70 + 57 + 75 = 378
- Agent 1's total valuation: 73 + 9 + 73 + 27 + 19 = 201

We will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives a bundle that maximizes their perceived value while minimizing envy.

### Initial Allocation Strategy

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 significantly more than Agent 1 (95 vs. 73).

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 significantly more than Agent 1 (81 vs. 9).

3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: 
   - Both agents value item 2 equally (70 vs. 73). Allocating this to Agent 1 will help balance the total value distribution.

4. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 3 more than Agent 1 (57 vs. 27).

5. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 4 more than Agent 1 (75 vs. 19), but this allocation balances the number of items each agent receives.

### Final Allocations

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a share of approximately equal total value from their perspective, given their respective valuations.

### JSON Format Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation is designed to minimize envy and provide a fair division based on the given valuations.
