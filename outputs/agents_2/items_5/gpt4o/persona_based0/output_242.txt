Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  17  77  46  50
1  53  64  77  48  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuation and attempts to balance the perceived value between them. The goal is to ensure that each agent believes they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's first list the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values: [54, 17, 77, 46, 50]
- Agent 1 values: [53, 64, 77, 48, 67]

We will try to distribute the items such that the total value perceived by each agent is as balanced as possible.

1. Agent 0 highly values item 2, so we can assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 also values item 2 highly, but since it is already assigned to agent 0, we'll assign them another item they value highly, like item 4.
3. Next, we assign the remaining items to balance the total value.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (value 77), Item 1 (value 17), Item 3 (value 46)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (value 53), Item 4 (value 67)

Let's check the total value for each agent:

- Total value for Agent 0: 77 + 17 + 46 = 140
- Total value for Agent 1: 53 + 67 = 120

While this allocation is not perfectly balanced, it is one of the ways to distribute the items given the constraint of integer allocations. Agent 0 receives a higher total valuation, but Agent 1 receives the items they value most after item 2. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
