Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  93  13  56  25
1  48  69   7  38  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1), we should aim for an allocation where neither agent envies the other. This means each agent should feel they received at least as much value from their allocation as they believe the other agent received.

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has over all items:

- Agent 0's valuations: 65, 93, 13, 56, 25. Total = 65 + 93 + 13 + 56 + 25 = 252.
- Agent 1's valuations: 48, 69, 7, 38, 94. Total = 48 + 69 + 7 + 38 + 94 = 256.

Both agents have similar total valuations over the items, so we can proceed to allocate the items to avoid envy.

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction by considering the highest individual valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
    - Highest value item: Item 1 (value = 93)
    - Second highest: Item 0 (value = 65)
    - Third highest: Item 3 (value = 56)

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Highest value item: Item 4 (value = 94)
    - Second highest: Item 1 (value = 69)
    - Third highest: Item 0 (value = 48)

Based on this, a potential fair allocation is:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 93, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 69).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 94, and it's their highest valued item).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 65, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 48).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 56, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 38).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 7, whereas Agent 0 values it at 13).

Final allocations to ensure all items are distributed:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 4.

This allocation should minimize envy as each agent receives their most valued items considering the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
