Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  62  17  59  14
1  49   0  20  84   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that both agents feel they have received a fair share according to their valuations. One way to achieve this is to aim for an envy-free allocation where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: \(8 + 62 + 17 + 59 + 14 = 160\)
- Agent 1's total value: \(49 + 0 + 20 + 84 + 6 = 159\)

Now, let's allocate the items in a way that balances their perceived value. We'll aim for allocations that are as envy-free as possible.

### Allocation Process

1. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this the most at 84. Assign to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this the most at 62. Assign to Agent 0.
3. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this at 49 (higher than Agent 0's 8). Assign to Agent 1.
4. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this at 17, while Agent 1 values it at 20. It can be assigned to either, but to balance allocation, assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values this at 14, while Agent 1 values it at 6. To balance allocations, assign to Agent 0.

### Resulting Allocations

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 and Item 4
- **Agent 1**: Item 3, Item 0, and Item 2

This allocation gives Agent 0 items with a total valuation of \(62 + 14 = 76\) and Agent 1 items with a total valuation of \(84 + 49 + 20 = 153\). Though not perfectly balanced in terms of total value, this allocation considers the highest singular valuations and aims to reduce envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, while all items are distributed.
