Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  76  26  79   1
1  52  62  95   0  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own. One approach to achieve this is to use a method similar to the "maximum value" allocation strategy, where we try to maximize the total value for each agent with respect to their own preferences.

Let's analyze the table of valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations:
  - Item 0: 46
  - Item 1: 76
  - Item 2: 26
  - Item 3: 79
  - Item 4: 1

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 52
  - Item 1: 62
  - Item 2: 95
  - Item 3: 0
  - Item 4: 93

To allocate items fairly, we should aim for a scenario where both agents are satisfied with their allocations with respect to their valuations. A possible way to achieve this is to allocate items based on maximizing the value each agent receives from their assigned items.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for Agent 0 compared to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as it also has a high value for Agent 0.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1, as it has a high value for Agent 1.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as it has a slightly higher value for Agent 1 compared to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3, with a total value of 76 + 79 = 155.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, and 4, with a total value of 52 + 95 + 93 = 240.

Both agents have allocations that maximize their valuations without causing envy towards the other agent.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
