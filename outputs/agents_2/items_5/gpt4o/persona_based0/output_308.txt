Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  90  15  75  37
1  59  14   1  68  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that achieves envy-freeness or as close as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

Let's begin by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 94
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 15
  - Item 3: 75
  - Item 4: 37

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 14
  - Item 2: 1
  - Item 3: 68
  - Item 4: 22

To reach an allocation, consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0 = 94 + 90 + 15 + 75 + 37 = 311
- Total value for Agent 1 = 59 + 14 + 1 + 68 + 22 = 164

Let's try to allocate items such that both agents get a fair share according to their own valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 has significantly higher valuations, we can start by giving them items they value highly, aiming to share some of the high-value items with Agent 1.

2. **Agent 1**: Balance the allocation by providing items that Agent 1 values fairly, considering their lower total valuation.

### Proposed Allocation:

- Assign items 0, 1 to Agent 0 because they have high valuations for these items.
- Assign items 3, 4 to Agent 1 because they are valued moderately by Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it is not highly valued by either agent, but Agent 0 has a slightly higher valuation for it.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 1, 2].
- Agent 1 gets items [3, 4].

Let's present the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
