Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  48  79  81  41
1   8  66  81  46  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize the total utility for each agent while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation. 

We have the following valuations:

- Agent 0: [72, 48, 79, 81, 41]
- Agent 1: [8, 66, 81, 46, 14]

Let's aim for a distribution where each agent values their bundle at least as much as the other agent values it, thereby achieving envy-freeness.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Highest Valuation First**: Assign the item with the highest valuation to the respective agent.
   - Agent 0 assigns the highest value to item 3 (81).
   - Agent 1 assigns the highest value to item 2 (81).

2. **Next Highest Valuation**: After assigning the highest valued items, assign the next highest valued items considering the remaining items and agents.
   - Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 2 (79), but it's already taken. The next available is item 0 (72).
   - Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 1 (66).

3. **Continue Allocation**:
   - Agent 0's next available highest valued item is item 1 (48), but it's already taken, so we assign item 4 (41).
   - Agent 1's remaining item is item 3 (46).

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle that maximizes their utility without causing envy.

### JSON Format Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation is fair and envy-free given the constraints and valuations provided.
