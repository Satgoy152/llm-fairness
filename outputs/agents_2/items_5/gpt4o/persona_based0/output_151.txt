Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  79  37  41   5
1  73  28  10  44  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents while minimizing envy, we should consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. Our goal is to ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [97, 79, 37, 41, 5]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [73, 28, 10, 44, 90]

A common approach to achieve envy-freeness is to allocate items such that each agent maximizes their total perceived value, given the constraints.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 97, whereas Agent 1 values it at 73.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 79, whereas Agent 1 values it at 28.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 37, whereas Agent 1 values it at 10.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 41, whereas Agent 1 values it at 44.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 5, whereas Agent 1 values it at 90.
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of \(97 + 79 + 37 = 213\) and Agent 1 a total value of \(44 + 90 = 134\).

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This division ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and the allocation is envy-free given the valuations.
