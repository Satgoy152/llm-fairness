Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  33   6  39  50
1  30  75  61   3  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close as possible given the constraints. This means each agent should feel that they received at least as much value as the other agent, considering their own valuations.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 63
  - Item 1: 33
  - Item 2: 6
  - Item 3: 39
  - Item 4: 50

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 30
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 61
  - Item 3: 3
  - Item 4: 36

We will try to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is maximized according to their preferences while maintaining fairness.

Let's examine potential allocations:

1. **Allocation based on maximizing individual satisfaction:**
   - Agent 0 prioritizes items 0, 4, and 3 because they have the highest values for them.
   - Agent 1 prioritizes items 1 and 2 because they have the highest values for them.

2. **Initial allocation attempt:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

This gives us the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, and 4 with total value: 63 + 39 + 50 = 152
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2 with total value: 75 + 61 = 136

This allocation provides a reasonable division, where Agent 0 gets slightly more value, but each agent receives their most highly valued items available.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
