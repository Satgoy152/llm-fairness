Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  15  97  36  81
1  28  28  63   5  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their own valuations.

Let's start by evaluating the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 70 + 15 + 97 + 36 + 81 = 299
- Agent 1: 28 + 28 + 63 + 5 + 44 = 168

Agent 0 has a significantly higher total valuation than Agent 1, indicating that Agent 0 values the items more overall. Our goal is to allocate the items to minimize envy and ensure a fair division based on the given valuations.

Let's consider allocating the items step-by-step:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item the highest (97). Allocating it to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.
   
2. **Item 0**: Agent 0 also values this item highly (70), while Agent 1 values it less (28). Allocating it to Agent 0 decreases potential envy.

3. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 81, and Agent 1 at 44. Allocating it to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.

4. **Item 1**: Both agents value this equally (15). To balance the allocation, we can give it to Agent 1.

5. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 36, and Agent 1 at 5. Allocating it to Agent 0 maintains their satisfaction, but given Agent 1 has received only one item so far, we allocate it to Agent 1 to balance the total number of items.

With these allocations, Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 4, while Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3. This allocation aims to balance the valuations and minimize envy.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
