Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  29  41  13  62
1  12  50  56  96  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [12 50 56 96 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free as much as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own, based on their own valuation.

### Step-by-Step Allocation Process:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation Per Agent:**
   - Agent 0's highest valuations: Item 0 (90), Item 4 (62)
   - Agent 1's highest valuations: Item 3 (96), Item 2 (56)

2. **Attempt Initial Fair Allocation:**
   - Assign Agent 0 their highest valued item (Item 0).
   - Assign Agent 1 their highest valued item (Item 3).

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: 1, 2, 4
   - Agent 0's next highest valued item is Item 4 (62).
   - Agent 1's next highest valued item is Item 2 (56).
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Allocate the Last Remaining Item:**
   - Remaining item: Item 1
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 29, whereas Agent 1 values it at 50.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 as it is more valued by Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

After following this process, each agent receives an allocation that aims to minimize envy based on their valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 2, 1]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the perceived value each agent receives and strives for fairness given the constraints.
