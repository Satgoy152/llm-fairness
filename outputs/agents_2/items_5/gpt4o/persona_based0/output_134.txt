Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  97  62  98  89
1  28  34  58   5  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the division is envy-free (or as close to envy-free as possible given integer allocations), we will consider the valuations of each agent.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [69, 97, 62, 98, 89]
- Agent 1: [28, 34, 58, 5, 92]

We'll aim to allocate the items such that each agent's total valuation is maximized while ensuring no envy, if possible. Let's consider the potential allocations:

1. Agent 0 has higher valuations for every item except item 4.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most (92), so it makes sense to allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (98), so allocating item 3 to Agent 0 would be beneficial for them.
4. For the remaining items, we need to distribute them in a way that balances the total value for each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it is their highest-valued item.
- For the remaining items (0, 1, 2), the allocation should be balanced by adding them to the totals.

After examining the remaining items:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (97), which is their second-highest valued item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (58), which gives them a better valuation balance.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (69), which provides a reasonable balance.

Now, let's check the total valuations:

- Agent 0: 69 (item 0) + 97 (item 1) + 98 (item 3) = 264
- Agent 1: 58 (item 2) + 92 (item 4) = 150

While the allocation is not perfectly envy-free, it is balanced given the constraints of integer allocations.

The final allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
