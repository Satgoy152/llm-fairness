Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  91  90  65  28
1  47  11  40  62  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free, if possible, or at least as fair as possible given the constraints.

We have the following valuations:

- Agent 0: [22, 91, 90, 65, 28]
- Agent 1: [47, 11, 40, 62, 50]

The goal is to allocate all 5 items between the two agents. One common method to approach this problem is to use the "round-robin" or "alternating choice" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that is still available. This often results in a fair allocation.

Let's simulate this process:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (91). It picks item 1.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (47). It picks item 0.

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0's next highest value is item 2 (90). It picks item 2.
   - Agent 1's next highest value is item 3 (62). It picks item 3.

3. **Round 3:**
   - The remaining item is 4. Agent 0 values it at 28, and Agent 1 values it at 50. Since it's the last item and Agent 1 has a higher valuation for it, we give item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 2
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 3, 4

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's valuations as much as possible given the constraints of integer allocations.
