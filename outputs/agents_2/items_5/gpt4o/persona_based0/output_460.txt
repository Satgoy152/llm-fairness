Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  37  57  71  57  47
1  29  37  26  87  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the method of maximizing the minimum share of value each agent receives. This approach ensures that each agent receives as close to their fair share as possible based on their valuations.

First, let's calculate the total value that each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(37 + 57 + 71 + 57 + 47 = 269\)
- Agent 1: \(29 + 37 + 26 + 87 + 85 = 264\)

Now we will aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives approximately half of their total valuation since there are two agents. This means:

- Agent 0's fair share: \(269 / 2 = 134.5\)
- Agent 1's fair share: \(264 / 2 = 132\)

To achieve this, we will allocate the items to maximize the value for each agent while ensuring the total number of items allocated equals 5.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent.**
2. **Allocate items to balance each agent's total valuation with respect to their fair share.**

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- **Agent 0's highest values:** Item 2 (71), Item 1 (57), Item 3 (57)
- **Agent 1's highest values:** Item 3 (87), Item 4 (85)

Given these preferences, a possible allocation is:

- **Agent 0** receives Items: 0, 1, 2
  - Total value: \(37 + 57 + 71 = 165\)
- **Agent 1** receives Items: 3, 4
  - Total value: \(87 + 85 = 172\)

This allocation ensures each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their valuation and is as close to their fair share as possible. Agent 0 receives slightly more than their fair share, while Agent 1 also receives slightly more, balancing the total allocation.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
