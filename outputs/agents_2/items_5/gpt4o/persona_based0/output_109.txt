Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  31  74  43  45
1  47  62  24  18  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [47 62 24 18 76]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents that minimizes envy, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to balance the total value of items each agent receives.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [22, 31, 74, 43, 45]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [47, 62, 24, 18, 76]

To attempt an envy-free allocation, we can try to balance the total value each agent receives according to their valuations.

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 2: Value 74 (highest value for Agent 0)
   - Item 3: Value 43
   - Total Value = 74 + 43 = 117

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 4: Value 76 (highest value for Agent 1)
   - Item 1: Value 62
   - Item 0: Value 47
   - Total Value = 76 + 62 + 47 = 185

By this allocation, each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated. This allocation minimizes the potential for envy given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This ensures all 5 items are fairly distributed without leaving any item unallocated.
