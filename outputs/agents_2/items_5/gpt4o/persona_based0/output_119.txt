Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  75  91  41   2
1  62  83  51  96  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we aim to ensure that neither agent envies the other based on their valuation of the items they receive. A common approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations while also ensuring a roughly equal distribution of total value.

Let's calculate the total value for each possible allocation:

### Step 1: Calculate the total value of items for each agent
- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 4
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 91
  - Item 3: 41
  - Item 4: 2

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 62
  - Item 1: 83
  - Item 2: 51
  - Item 3: 96
  - Item 4: 95

### Step 2: Assign items to minimize envy
1. **High-value items for Agent 1:**
   - Item 3: 96
   - Item 4: 95

2. **High-value items for Agent 0:**
   - Item 2: 91
   - Item 1: 75

3. **Remaining item for balance:**
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 for better balance.

### Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 3, and 4.

### Resulting allocation:
- Total value for Agent 0: 75 (Item 1) + 91 (Item 2) = 166
- Total value for Agent 1: 62 (Item 0) + 96 (Item 3) + 95 (Item 4) = 253

This allocation attempts to minimize envy while maximizing the total valuation for each agent based on the high-valued items.

### Final allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
