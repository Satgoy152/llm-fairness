Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  62  68  41  95
1  49  66  71   8  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, meaning that each agent should be at least as happy with their allocation as they would be with the other agent's allocation. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [24, 62, 68, 41, 95]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [49, 66, 71, 8, 64]

We'll use these valuations to determine an allocation that aims to minimize envy.

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0's highest value item is 4 (value: 95).
   - Agent 1's highest value item is 2 (value: 71).

2. **Allocate these highest-valued items to respective agents:**
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items based on next highest preferences and to balance the total number of items:**
   - Agent 0's next highest value items (excluding item 4) are item 2 (68), item 1 (62), item 3 (41), and item 0 (24).
   - Agent 1's next highest value items (excluding item 2) are item 1 (66), item 0 (49), item 4 (64), and item 3 (8).

4. **Allocate the remaining items:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 since it's their second-highest valued item, and it balances the allocation.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 to further balance the allocation.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 since it has a higher relative value to Agent 0 than Agent 1.

**Final allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives both agents a fair share based on their preferences and distributes all items.
