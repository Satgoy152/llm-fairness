Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  30  79  97  34
1  71   1  12  32  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 8 30 79 97 34]
 [71  1 12 32 61]]
Output:
To ensure a fair allocation that is envy-free, we must consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to allocate the items in such a way that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent given their own valuation.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

```
Agent 0: [8, 30, 79, 97, 34]
Agent 1: [71, 1, 12, 32, 61]
```

To begin the allocation, we can follow a strategy where we try to allocate high-value items to each agent based on their own valuations. This should help in achieving an envy-free allocation.

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**

    - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (97), followed by item 2 (79).
    - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (71), followed by item 4 (61).

2. **Allocate initial high-value items:**

    - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
    - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**

   After allocating the initial high-value items, we proceed to allocate the remaining items to balance the allocations:

    - Agent 0 has item 3.
    - Agent 1 has item 0.

    Consider the remaining items: 1, 2, 4.

    - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (since it is the next highest valued by Agent 0).
    - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest valued for Agent 1).
    - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1).

4. **Final Allocation:**

   After these steps, all items are allocated as follows:

    - Agent 0: Items 3, 2, 1
    - Agent 1: Items 0, 4

This allocation considers the individual valuations and aims to minimize envy between agents.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 1],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
