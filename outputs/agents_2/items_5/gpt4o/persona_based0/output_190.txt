Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

   0   1   2   3   4
0  9  63  72  31  61
1  8  64  46  26  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents in a way that is envy-free or as fair as possible given their valuations, we should aim to distribute items such that each agent feels their allocation is at least as valuable as the other agent's allocation. This can be challenging when valuations differ significantly, but we will attempt to balance perceived value.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 0: 9, 1: 63, 2: 72, 3: 31, 4: 61
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: 0: 8, 1: 64, 2: 46, 3: 26, 4: 55

The goal is to allocate these 5 items between the two agents. A possible allocation strategy is to maximize each agent's total perceived value while ensuring both receive a similar total value.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (72), 1 (63), 4 (61)
   - Allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 0, because these maximize Agent 0's value.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 1 (64), 4 (55), 2 (46)
   - Allocate items 1, 3, and 0 to Agent 1, as these maximize Agent 1's value without making Agent 0 envious.

### Calculated Allocation
- **Agent 0** receives items 2 and 4.
  - Total value for Agent 0: 72 + 61 = 133
- **Agent 1** receives items 0, 1, and 3.
  - Total value for Agent 1: 8 + 64 + 26 = 98

This allocation tries to balance the total perceived value for both agents. Agent 0 receives high-valued items according to their valuation, and Agent 1 receives a combination of items that together give them a comparable value. Although the exact values will differ, the allocation aims to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they value highly.

### Final Allocations
Here are the allocations represented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are distributed, and each agent receives an allocation they regard as valuable, given the constraints of their valuations.
