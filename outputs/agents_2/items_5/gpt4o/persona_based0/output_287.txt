Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  79  14  23  69
1  44  95  81  30  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of utilities while ensuring envy-freeness. This means each agent should feel they have received a fair share of the total value, considering their own valuations.

First, let's examine the total valuations each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 91 + 79 + 14 + 23 + 69 = 276
- Agent 1's total valuation: 44 + 95 + 81 + 30 + 73 = 323

Next, let's try to allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations:

1. Start by allocating the highest-valued item for each agent so that they feel they are getting something valuable.
2. Attempt to balance the remaining items between the agents to ensure neither feels envious of the other's allocation.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (value 91), so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (value 95), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.

Now allocate the remaining items with an eye on balancing total values for each agent:

- Agent 0 has item 0 worth 91, so we might consider adding another item to balance.
- Agent 1 has item 1 worth 95, and they value item 2 highly (value 81), so assign item 2 to Agent 1.

Now, distribute the remaining items (3 and 4):

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, who values it 69.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, who values it 23.

Finally, letâ€™s review the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 3, and 4 with total valuation: 91 + 23 + 69 = 183
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2 with total valuation: 95 + 81 = 176

Both agents have similar total valuations, and this allocation respects their preferences as much as possible given the constraints.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
