Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  59  18   7  23
1  21  36   1  88  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while striving for envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their valuations. Here are the valuations from the table:

- Agent 0's valuations: [86, 59, 18, 7, 23]
- Agent 1's valuations: [21, 36, 1, 88, 56]

A common approach to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive. Here, we look for an allocation where both agents feel that, given their own valuations, the distribution is as equitable as possible.

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. **Initial Considerations**: 
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (value 86), while Agent 1 highly values item 3 (value 88).
   - Both agents have moderate valuations for the remaining items.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it's their highest value.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as it's their highest value.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, given that it's their second highest value and Agent 1 has a lower valuation.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as they value it significantly more than Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, since Agent 1 values it minimally.

3. **Resulting Allocation**: 
   - Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, and 2.
   - Agent 1 gets items 3 and 4.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed. Here is the resulting allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
