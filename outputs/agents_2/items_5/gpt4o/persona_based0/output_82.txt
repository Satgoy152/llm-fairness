Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57   3  58  25  19
1  84  52  35  62  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that minimizes envy, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to find an allocation where both agents feel they are getting a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations:
  - Item 0: 57
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 58
  - Item 3: 25
  - Item 4: 19

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 84
  - Item 1: 52
  - Item 2: 35
  - Item 3: 62
  - Item 4: 22

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can use the following strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it most.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 84, while Agent 0 values it at 57. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 52, while Agent 0 values it at 3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 58, while Agent 1 values it at 35. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 62, while Agent 0 values it at 25. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 19, while Agent 1 values it at 22. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 3, 4]

The allocation is complete, with all items distributed. Agent 0 receives the item they value the most (Item 2), while Agent 1 receives the remaining items, which they value more highly than Agent 0.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```
