Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  87  62  85  91
1   0  18  49  38  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 5 items between the 2 agents in a way that is fair, considering their valuations. A common approach to ensure fairness is to minimize envy, which means trying to allocate items so that each agent feels they received their fair share given their own valuations.

Let's consider each agent's total valuation of all items:

- Agent 0: 75 + 87 + 62 + 85 + 91 = 400
- Agent 1: 0 + 18 + 49 + 38 + 76 = 181

A straightforward way to approach this is to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as close as possible to their proportional share of the total value of all items. The total value of all items is 400 + 181 = 581.

Agent 0 should ideally receive a value of (400/581) * 581 = 400, and Agent 1 should ideally receive a value of (181/581) * 581 = 181. However, since these are rounded to integers and we must allocate all items, we focus on minimizing envy.

A possible allocation strategy could be:

1. Assign the highest valued items to the agent who values them most.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item to avoid extreme envy.

Let's go through the items based on the highest valuations:

1. Item 4 (valued at 91 by Agent 0 and 76 by Agent 1) - Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1 (valued at 87 by Agent 0 and 18 by Agent 1) - Assign to Agent 0.
3. Item 3 (valued at 85 by Agent 0 and 38 by Agent 1) - Assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 0 (valued at 75 by Agent 0 and 0 by Agent 1) - Assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 2 (valued at 62 by Agent 0 and 49 by Agent 1) - Assign to Agent 1.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3, 4 with total valuation 75 + 87 + 85 + 91 = 338
- Agent 1: Item 2 with total valuation 49

This distribution minimizes envy and respects the integer constraint for item distribution while ensuring that both agents have at least one item.

    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2]
