Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  59  83  58  49
1  72  66  98  91  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation and ensure envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Envy-freeness implies that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's first list the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [18, 59, 83, 58, 49]
- Agent 1: [72, 66, 98, 91, 18]

We'll calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: \(18 + 59 + 83 + 58 + 49 = 267\)
- Total value for Agent 1: \(72 + 66 + 98 + 91 + 18 = 345\)

Now, considering these total valuations, we'll attempt to allocate items to maximize fairness and minimize envy. 

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 2 with a value of 98 and item 3 with a value of 91. Allocating these items to Agent 1 would significantly increase their satisfaction.
- **Agent 0** values item 2 at 83, which is their highest preference. However, since Agent 1 values it higher, we allocate item 2 to Agent 1. 
- Agent 1 also has a high valuation for item 1 (66) and item 0 (72), but these are not as high as items 2 and 3.
- **Agent 0** should receive items 0, 1, and 4, as these items collectively have a higher valuation for Agent 0 compared to Agent 1.

Based on this strategy, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, and 4
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 3

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences while minimizing envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON format:

{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
