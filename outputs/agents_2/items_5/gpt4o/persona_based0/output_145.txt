Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  55  58   5  50
1  21   2   4  67  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while minimizing envy, we can consider the valuations each agent places on the items. The goal is to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [95, 55, 58, 5, 50]
- Agent 1's valuations: [21, 2, 4, 67, 66]

We want to allocate all 5 items to the two agents, ensuring that the allocation minimizes any potential envy.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0. This item has the highest value for Agent 0 (95).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1. This item has the highest value for Agent 1 (67).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 1. This item has the second-highest value for Agent 1 (66).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0. This item has a moderate value for Agent 0 (55), but very low for Agent 1 (2).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 0. This item has a moderate value for Agent 0 (58), but low for Agent 1 (4).

This allocation is aimed at minimizing envy by ensuring each agent receives items that they value more highly than the other agent would.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
