Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  31  57  71  39
1  75  45  48  35  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve a division that is as envy-free as possible given the valuations. Envy-freeness is a situation where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [18, 31, 57, 71, 39]
- Agent 1: [75, 45, 48, 35, 77]

We'll start by calculating the total valuation each agent assigns to all items and then proceed to allocate items in a manner that tries to balance the perceived total value for each agent.

Total Valuations:
- Agent 0: 18 + 31 + 57 + 71 + 39 = 216
- Agent 1: 75 + 45 + 48 + 35 + 77 = 280

One possible way to allocate items to achieve a fair division is to focus on maximizing each agent's satisfaction by allocating items based on their highest relative valuations. Here's one way to proceed:

1. **Item 3** and **Item 2** can go to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0's valuations for items 3 and 2 are 71 and 57, respectively.
   - Agent 1's valuations for these items are lower, at 35 and 48.

2. **Item 0**, **Item 1**, and **Item 4** can go to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1's valuations for these items are 75, 45, and 77, respectively.
   - Agent 0's valuations for these items are lower, at 18, 31, and 39.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction given their relative valuations, and it ensures that all items are allocated.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
