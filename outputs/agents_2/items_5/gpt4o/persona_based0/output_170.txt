Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  59  95  54  83
1  16  94   3  62  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation compared to the other's.

Here's the valuation table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 76     | 59     | 95     | 54     | 83     |
| 1     | 16     | 94     | 3      | 62     | 58     |

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a method where we assign items to the agents based on maximizing their relative valuations and minimizing envy. This often involves finding an allocation where each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as or more than the other agent values it.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Assign Items to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 (95) and 0 (76).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Assign Items to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 (94) and 3 (62).
   - Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Items 0 and 4 are left. Given Agent 0's higher valuation for item 0 compared to Agent 1, allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as they have a relatively higher valuation for it than Agent 1.

Given this approach, the allocation will be:

- **Agent 0** receives items 0, 2, and 4.
- **Agent 1** receives items 1 and 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items such that their bundle is most valuable to them, minimizing envy based on their valuation.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
