Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  80  20  37  71
1  84  96  62  84  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [10, 80, 20, 37, 71]
- Agent 1: [84, 96, 62, 84, 21]

To find an envy-free allocation, we can consider the following approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most at 80.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 96.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Since both agents highly value item 1 but Agent 1 values it more, we can allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 4 quite highly (71), so we can allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Next, allocate items by considering high remaining values:
     - Agent 0 highly values item 3 (37), allocate it to Agent 0.
     - Agent 1 values item 0 (84) and item 2 (62) reasonably well, so we can allocate these to Agent 1.

3. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value reasonably well, aiming for envy-freeness.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
