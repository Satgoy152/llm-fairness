Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  12  20  31  64
1  61  35  89  90  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent. The goal is to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives a set of items that they value highly, thereby approximating an envy-free allocation.

Let's examine the valuations for each item-agent pair:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 60
  - Item 1: 12
  - Item 2: 20
  - Item 3: 31
  - Item 4: 64

- Agent 1 values: 
  - Item 0: 61
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 89
  - Item 3: 90
  - Item 4: 93

To create a fair allocation:
1. Assign items that each agent values more compared to the other agent.
2. Attempt to balance the total valuation for each agent to minimize envy.

By comparing the valuations:
- Agent 1 highly values Items 2, 3, and 4 compared to Agent 0.
- Agent 0 has higher relative valuations for Items 0 and 1 compared to Agent 1.

A reasonable allocation could be:
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (valued at 60 by Agent 0 and 61 by Agent 1)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (valued at 12 by Agent 0 and 35 by Agent 1)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (valued at 20 by Agent 0 and 89 by Agent 1)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (valued at 31 by Agent 0 and 90 by Agent 1)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (valued at 64 by Agent 0 and 93 by Agent 1)

This allocation ensures that Agent 1 receives the items they value most and Agent 0 receives the items that they value relatively more compared to Agent 1.

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
