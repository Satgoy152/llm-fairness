Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  81  34  13  11
1  61  90  77  21   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly and achieve an envy-free distribution, we need to ensure that each agent feels that they received a fair share based on their valuations. Given that there are only two agents and five items, one approach is to consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while minimizing potential envy.

Here are the valuations:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 21 | 81 | 34 | 13 | 11 |
| 1          | 61 | 90 | 77 | 21 | 7  |

One way to approach this is to use the "divide and choose" method, where we try to balance the total value received by each agent. Let's proceed with item allocations:

1. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 and 2. Allocating these to Agent 1 maximizes their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 0** can be given items for which their relative valuation is higher than Agent 1's, such as items 0, 3, and 4.

Let's calculate the total value each agent receives:

- **Agent 1**: Items 1 (90) and 2 (77) = 167
- **Agent 0**: Items 0 (21), 3 (13), and 4 (11) = 45

This division ensures that Agent 1 receives their two most valued items, and Agent 0 gets the remaining items, which are less valuable to Agent 1. This allocation is envy-free as each agent values their own allocation at least as highly as the other's allocation.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
