Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  55   6  73   1
1   3   3  78  53  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division where possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over the allocation of the other agent, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     |   18   |   55   |    6   |   73   |    1   |
| 1     |    3   |    3   |   78   |   53   |   63   |

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 18 + 55 + 6 + 73 + 1 = 153
- Agent 1: 3 + 3 + 78 + 53 + 63 = 200

To determine allocations:

1. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values item 3 highly (73), and Agent 1 also values it highly (53). Since it's the highest valued item for Agent 0, let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0 to minimize potential envy.

2. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values item 2 the most (78). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 4**: This item is valued at 1 by Agent 0 and 63 by Agent 1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 1**: Valued at 55 by Agent 0 and 3 by Agent 1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 0**: Valued at 18 by Agent 0 and 3 by Agent 1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 3, with a total valuation of 18 + 55 + 73 = 146.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4, with a total valuation of 78 + 63 = 141.

This allocation is designed to minimize envy, as each agent receives the items they value highly. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation meets the requirements of distributing all items and ensures each agent gets an integer number of items.
