Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  64  49  19  97
1  73  20  89  92  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. A common method to approach this is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion. This criterion allows for a situation where any envy can be removed by the hypothetical removal of at most one item from another agent's allocation.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 35 (item 0) + 64 (item 1) + 49 (item 2) + 19 (item 3) + 97 (item 4) = 264
- Agent 1: 73 (item 0) + 20 (item 1) + 89 (item 2) + 92 (item 3) + 29 (item 4) = 303

Now, let's consider allocating the items to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 (97) the most, so we give item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 (92) the most, so we give item 3 to agent 1.

Next, we look at the remaining items: 0, 1, and 2.

- Agent 0's highest remaining value is item 1 (64).
- Agent 1's highest remaining value is item 2 (89).

Let's allocate based on remaining highest values:

3. Give item 1 to agent 0.
4. Give item 2 to agent 1.

Now we have one item left, item 0, which both agents have some value for:

- Agent 0 values item 0 at 35.
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 73.

Given the remaining item 0, it makes sense to give it to agent 1 to balance the overall valuations, as agent 1 values it more highly.

The allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, and 3.

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
