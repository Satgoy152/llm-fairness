Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  50  55  54  46
1  86  87  73  48  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we aim for allocations that are as envy-free as possible and equitable based on their valuations. The valuations are given as follows:

- Agent 0's valuations: [5, 50, 55, 54, 46]
- Agent 1's valuations: [86, 87, 73, 48, 98]

A good starting point to achieve fairness is to assign each agent the items they value highly, while attempting to balance the total value each agent receives. Let's evaluate the total value each agent perceives for all items:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 5 + 50 + 55 + 54 + 46 = 210
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 86 + 87 + 73 + 48 + 98 = 392

Given these total valuations, we aim to allocate items such that the total perceived value is roughly equal for both agents. We'll try to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they value highly.

Let's work through the allocation:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (value 98), so assign item 4 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 1** also values item 1 (value 87), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (value 55), so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 0** also values item 3 (value 54), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
5. The remaining item 0 is valued significantly higher by **Agent 1** (value 86 compared to Agent 0's value of 5), so assign item 0 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 gets items [2, 3] with a total value of 55 + 54 = 109.
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 1, 4] with a total value of 86 + 87 + 98 = 271.

While this allocation is not perfectly equitable in terms of total valuations, it tries to minimize envy by giving each agent items they highly value. It's essential to note that achieving complete envy-freeness and equity can be challenging with only integer allocations and without additional items or agents.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
