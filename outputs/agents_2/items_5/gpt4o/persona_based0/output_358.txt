Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  53  70  65  84
1  10  74  30  52  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while minimizing envy, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's utility given their valuations of the items. 

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0 values: [30, 53, 70, 65, 84]
- Agent 1 values: [10, 74, 30, 52, 39]

To achieve a fair division, we aim to maximize the total utility each agent receives from their allocated items, while ensuring the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. 

One potential approach is to allocate items to maximize the sum of the agents' valuations for the items they receive. We can try different allocation combinations, ensuring each agent receives a total that is as close as possible to each other to minimize envy.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it is the most valued item for Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as it is the most valued item for Agent 1.
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as it provides significant utility and is the next highest valued item for Agent 0.
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as it provides a good value to Agent 1 and balances the utility.
5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as it balances out the total value received by both agents.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 4, with a total valuation of 70 + 84 = 154.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 3, with a total valuation of 10 + 74 + 52 = 136.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent while considering their individual preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
