Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  75  45  59  77
1  16   3  60  15  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we should aim for an envy-free division where each agent receives items such that they feel they are getting at least as good a bundle as what others have received, according to their own valuations. The goal is to allocate all 5 items between the agents as fairly as possible.

Looking at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 45
  - Item 3: 59
  - Item 4: 77

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 16
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 60
  - Item 3: 15
  - Item 4: 52

One effective approach is to maximize each agent's satisfaction by allocating items to the agent who values them the most.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 values it at 16.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 values it at 3.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 values it at 60.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 values it at 15.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 values it at 52.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

With this allocation, Agent 0 receives four items they highly value, and Agent 1 receives the item they value the most. This may not be perfectly envy-free but maximizes total value, which is a common approach for two-agent problems.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
