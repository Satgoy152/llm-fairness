Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  90  61   5   8
1  72  37  29  88  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use the method of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their individual valuations.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:  
  - Item 0: 18 
  - Item 1: 90 
  - Item 2: 61 
  - Item 3: 5  
  - Item 4: 8  

- Agent 1 values:  
  - Item 0: 72 
  - Item 1: 37 
  - Item 2: 29 
  - Item 3: 88 
  - Item 4: 98  

To achieve a fair division, we need to look at combinations where each agent gets a set of items such that their perceived value is maximized and the division is envy-free as much as possible.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. Start by allocating the highest valued item for each agent if possible:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (value 90).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (value 98).

2. Allocate these items to the agents:
   - Agent 0 receives Item 1.
   - Agent 1 receives Item 4.

3. Allocate the next highest items, considering what's already allocated:
   - Agent 0's next highest valued item is Item 2 (value 61).
   - Agent 1's next highest valued item is Item 3 (value 88).

4. Allocate these items:
   - Agent 0 receives Item 2.
   - Agent 1 receives Item 3.

5. Allocate the remaining item (Item 0):
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 72, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 18.

6. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

**Final Allocation:**

Based on this approach, the allocations are:

Agent 0: Items 1 and 2  
Agent 1: Items 0, 3, and 4  

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
