Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  45  13  71  28
1   8  42  99  35  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy between the agents. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent should feel they received at least as much value as the other agent received, according to their own valuations.

The given valuations are:

- Agent 0: [79, 45, 13, 71, 28]
- Agent 1: [8, 42, 99, 35, 28]

To find an envy-free allocation, we should look for a division of items such that each agent receives a total value that they are satisfied with, and ideally, the values are as equal as possible.

Let's analyze potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0:** The highest valuations are for items 0 and 3 (79 and 71 respectively).
2. **Agent 1:** The highest valuation is for item 2 (99).

A possible allocation strategy could be:

- Give Agent 0 the items they value the most, i.e., 0 and 3.
- Give Agent 1 the item they value the most, i.e., 2.

Now, we have allocated 3 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items (1 and 4) in a way that maintains the fairness.

Continuing the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Already has items 0 and 3, with valuations totaling 150 (79 + 71).
  - Allocating item 1 could increase their total to 195 (150 + 45).

- **Agent 1:** 
  - Has item 2 with a valuation of 99.
  - Allocating items 1 and 4 together could increase their total to 169 (99 + 42 + 28).

Thus, a fair allocation can be:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 1, and 4.

This allocation considers the agents' valuations and strives for fairness, balancing the total values each agent receives.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 1, 4]
}
```
