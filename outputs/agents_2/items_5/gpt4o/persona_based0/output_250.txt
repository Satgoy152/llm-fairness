Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  83  68  69   7
1  76   3  50  80  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent perceives their allocation to be at least as good as the allocation of the other agent, based on their valuations. Given the table of valuations:

```
    Items
    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  83  68  69   7
1  76   3  50  80  89
```

We can calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 77 + 83 + 68 + 69 + 7 = 304
- Agent 1's total valuation: 76 + 3 + 50 + 80 + 89 = 298

The goal is to allocate the items such that the perceived value for each agent is maximized according to their valuations, while ensuring no agent envies the allocation of the other. 

Starting with items that have the highest individual valuations for each agent, we proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 1 (83) and item 0 (77).
- Agent 1 highly values item 4 (89) and item 3 (80).

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 3 and 4.

We have allocated 4 out of 5 items, leaving item 2 unallocated.

- Reviewing the remaining item, item 2, its valuation is higher for Agent 0 (68) than for Agent 1 (50), and since Agent 0 receives fewer items of lower value compared to Agent 1, it makes sense to allocate item 2 to Agent 0 to balance the perceived total value.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives, thereby aiming for a fair division based on the given valuations.
