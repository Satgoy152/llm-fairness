Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  20  83  43  70
1  29  94  86  28   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given this, let's proceed with the allocation.

### Valuations Table
- **Agent 0**: [40, 20, 83, 43, 70]
- **Agent 1**: [29, 94, 86, 28, 7]

### Initial Observations
- **Agent 0** values item 2 the most at 83.
- **Agent 1** values item 1 the most at 94.
  
### Allocation Strategy
1. **Assign item 1 to Agent 1**: This is the highest valued item for Agent 1.
2. **Assign item 2 to Agent 0**: This is the highest valued item for Agent 0.
3. Allocate the remaining items (0, 3, 4) by considering the next highest values for each agent.

### Remaining Items Allocation
- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 40, while Agent 1 values it at 29. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 43, while Agent 1 values it at 28. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 70, while Agent 1 values it at 7. Assign to Agent 0.

By following this strategy, Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, 3, and 4, while Agent 1 receives item 1.

### Final Allocations
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value most, reducing the potential for envy between them.
