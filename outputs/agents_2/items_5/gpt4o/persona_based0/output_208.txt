Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  14  88  99  64
1  26   6  35  32  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that neither agent envies the other.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 14
  - Item 2: 88
  - Item 3: 99
  - Item 4: 64

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 6
  - Item 2: 35
  - Item 3: 32
  - Item 4: 38

Let's calculate a fair allocation by considering which items each agent values the most.

1. **Agent 0** values Item 3 the highest (99).
2. **Agent 1** values Item 4 the highest (38).

Given these preferences, we can proceed with the allocation:

- Assign **Item 3** to **Agent 0**.
- Assign **Item 4** to **Agent 1**.

Next, let's allocate the remaining items to maximize the total valuation for each agent and minimize the potential for envy.

- **Item 2** has a high value for **Agent 0** (88) and a moderate value for **Agent 1** (35). Assign **Item 2** to **Agent 0**.
  
- **Item 0** has a moderate value for both agents, but it's slightly higher for **Agent 0** (34 vs. 26). Assign **Item 0** to **Agent 0**.

- **Item 1** has a low value for both agents, but **Agent 0** values it more than **Agent 1** (14 vs. 6). Assign **Item 1** to **Agent 0**.

Now, sum up the assigned values for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1, 2, 3], total valuation = 34 + 14 + 88 + 99 = 235
- **Agent 1**: Item [4], total valuation = 38

To make the allocation envy-free, we need to reallocate some items to balance the valuations better. Let's reallocate:

- Move **Item 2** from **Agent 0** to **Agent 1**. This changes the allocations as follows:

  - **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1, 3], total valuation = 34 + 14 + 99 = 147
  - **Agent 1**: Items [2, 4], total valuation = 35 + 38 = 73

This allocation is more balanced, and while there is still a valuation difference, the distribution considers the preferences of both agents.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items in a way that respects their valuations and minimizes envy.
